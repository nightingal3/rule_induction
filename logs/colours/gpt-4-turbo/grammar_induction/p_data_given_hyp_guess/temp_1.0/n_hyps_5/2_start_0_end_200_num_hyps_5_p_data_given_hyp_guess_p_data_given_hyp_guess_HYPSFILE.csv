Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: dax -> green,1.0,0,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word 'dax' by examining the position of 'dax' within various inputs, and the corresponding outputs.

In every instance of the input containing 'dax', regardless of its position or surrounding words, 'dax' always corresponds to the color 'green' in the output. The color before or after 'green' does not show a consistent pattern that would relate to 'dax.' Rather, it seems that the colors corresponding to other words ('walm,' 'zup,' 'lug,' 'wif') are consistent irrespective of the presence or absence of 'dax.'

Let's assign consistent colors based on the words that we can identify:

- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> blue (in the last example 'wif' seems to modify 'walm' since the output is red instead of blue)
- wif -> modifies the following word's output color to red 

Now let's test the rule:

Input: dax walm zup lug dax
Output prediction: green blue yellow blue green
Actual Output: green green yellow blue green

Input: dax zup
Output prediction: green yellow
Actual Output: green yellow

Input: lug dax
Output prediction: blue green
Actual Output: blue green

Input: wif dax lug walm
Output prediction: red green blue red (wif modifies the next word)
Actual Output: red green blue blue blue (wif only modified walm)

The rule predicted for 'dax' holds for each example. However, there is some inconsistency in how 'wif' affects the output. Nevertheless, based on the evidence at hand for 'dax':

Rule: dax -> green. Dax consistently corresponds to the color green regardless of its context within a string of words.",1.0,0,dax
"Based on the examples given, it appears that the word ""wif"" translates to the word ""red"". Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. For each occurrence of ""wif,"" there is a corresponding ""red"" in the output sequence.

"Based on the examples provided, the term ""wif"" seems to correspond to the color ""red."" Every time the word ""wif"" is used in the input, the color ""red"" is included in the output. Other words, such as ""dax,"" ""lug,"" and ""bluf,"" correspond to ""green,"" ""blue,"" and ""blue,"" respectively.

Examples showing the connection:
- In the first example, following ""wif"" with ""zup"" and then ""dax"" results in the sequence ""red yellow green,"" indicating that ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""dax"" is ""green.""
- In the second example, without ""wif,"" the output is missing ""red,"" which supports the idea that ""wif"" stands for ""red.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" appears three times, and each occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the output, aligning with the pattern.
- The fourth and fifth examples also support the pattern; when ""wif"" is present, ""red"" is in the output.

Rule: wif -> ""red"".",1.0,0,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can analyze the correspondence between the inputs and outputs to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""wif"".

In each input-output pair, ""wif"" always corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output. Here's the breakdown:

- ""wif zup dax"" corresponds to ""red yellow green,"" where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- ""dax wif"" corresponds to ""green red,"" where the order of colors matches the order of the given words.
- ""wif walm lug bluf"" corresponds to ""red red red blue blue,"" where ""wif"" produces a single ""red,"" ""walm"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" seems to extend the number of ""blue"" by one more occurrence.
- ""lug wif"" corresponds to ""blue red,” where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""lug bluf wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue red,"" and the inclusion of ""bluf"" again seems to extend the number of ""blue"" by one additional occurrence following ""lug"".

Given this consistent pattern across all examples where ""wif"" always results in the output ""red,"" we can deduce the meaning:

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color that corresponds to the previous word.",1.0,0,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the examples provided and the respective outputs.

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green

From these two examples, we can see that ""bluf"" generates a repetition of the color that precedes it.

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

This example reinforces the rule that ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the preceding color word.

Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
Output: green red green yellow yellow

In this longer sequence, we can see that ""bluf"" repeats the output of the color word just before it (in this case, ""yellow"" from ""zup"").

Input: lug bluf wif
Output: blue blue red

Again, ""bluf"" repeats the color ""blue"" from ""lug."" It does not affect the following word ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

Based on these examples, we can conclude the rule for ""bluf"" as follows:

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color indicated by the word preceding it.

In other words, ""bluf"" duplicates the output associated with the immediately preceding color keyword.",1.0,0,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's consider the outputs associated with it in various inputs. The outputs are consistently repeated twice. Along with the word ""bluf,"" we also see other words like ""wif,"" ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug,"" each correlating with a specific color.

Analyzing the examples:

- ""zup wif bluf"" -> yellow red red: Neither ""zup"" nor ""wif"" is repeated twice in the output, only ""bluf"" leads to the color being repeated.
- ""dax bluf"" -> green green: Both ""dax"" and ""bluf"" could lead to repeating colors, but from the other examples, we can deduce that ""dax"" is associated with a single instance of green.
- ""wif bluf"" -> red red: We can see that ""wif"" is associated with red, and due to ""bluf,"" it’s repeated.
- ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" -> green red green yellow yellow: We can see that ""dax"" and ""wif"" maintain their colors, ""green"" and ""red,"" respectively. ""Zup"" correlates with yellow. However, with ""bluf"" following ""zup,"" the yellow is repeated.
- ""lug bluf wif"" -> blue blue red: ""Lug"" correlates with blue, which is repeated, and ""wif"" with red but not repeated as ""bluf"" comes before ""wif.""

Combining these observations, it's evident that ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the following word to be repeated twice in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> causes the color of the word that follows it to be repeated.",1.0,0,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the color patterns related to each word:

- ""zup"" consistently generates ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" consistently generates ""red.""
- ""dax"" consistently generates ""green.""
- ""lug"" generates ""blue.""

Now, let's see how ""bluf"" behaves in relation to other words:

- When preceded by ""wif"" (as in ""wif bluf""), the output is doubled (""red red"").
- When preceded by ""dax"" (as in ""dax bluf""), the output is doubled (""green green"").
- When followed by ""wif"" (as in ""lug bluf wif""), ""bluf"" matches the color of the word before it, thus ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""bluf"" also generates ""blue.""

Given these observations, it seems ""bluf"" causes the word it is connected to (either before or after) to repeat its color output.

Rule: bluf -> Causes the color of the adjacent word to be repeated. If preceded by a color-word, the output color is doubled. If followed by a color-word, ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word.",0.8,0,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to compare the inputs with their respective outputs and look for patterns. Here's the analysis of the examples provided:

1. Input: ""zup wif bluf"" | Output: ""yellow red red""
2. Input: ""dax bluf"" | Output: ""green green""
3. Input: ""wif bluf"" | Output: ""red red""
4. Input: ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" | Output: ""green red green yellow yellow""
5. Input: ""lug bluf wif"" | Output: ""blue blue red""

Now, let's analyze each word and its outputs:

- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

Now let's focus on ""bluf"":

- In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" when preceded by ""wif.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" and is not followed by any word.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" when followed by ""wif.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" appears between ""lug"" and ""wif,"" and corresponds to ""blue.""

Based on the outputs, ""bluf"" appears to repeat the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it. When there is no preceding word (as in the second example), it might follow a default rule which isn't clear with the given data. For the last example, it may be the case that ""bluf"" only repeats the color if there is a single word before it, so having ""lug bluf wif"" might be breaking the pattern, or ""wif"" is overwriting the color to red due to its position after ""bluf."" 

Therefore, the tentative rule here is that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" means to repeat the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it.",0.8,0,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns or rules within the examples provided that relate to the usage of the word ""walm"" and the corresponding outputs. 

By examining the examples, let's consider the position of the word ""walm"" and the colors that follow:

1. dax walm wif zup -> green green green red yellow
2. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
3. zup walm dax lug -> yellow yellow yellow green blue
4. lug wif lug walm zup walm wif -> blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
5. dax walm zup -> green green green yellow

From the above examples, we can look for patterns related to the word ""walm"":
- In example 1, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output color for ""walm"" is green.
- In example 2, ""walm"" is at the end, and the output for ""walm"" is red.
- In example 3, ""walm"" is after ""zup"" and before ""dax,"" and the output color for ""walm"" is yellow.
- In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" in two instances. After the first ""lug,"" the output color for ""walm"" is blue. After the second ""lug"" and ""zup,"" the color for ""walm"" is blue and then yellow, respectively.
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""zup,"" with the output color being green and then yellow.

Based on these examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color of the preceding word:

- When preceded by ""dax,"" the color green is repeated (""walm"" follows ""dax"").
- When preceded by ""zup,"" the color yellow is repeated (""walm"" follows ""zup"").
- When preceded by ""lug,"" the color blue is repeated (""walm"" follows ""lug"").

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color of the word that comes directly before it.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color output of the word before it.",1.0,0,walm
"To figure out the meaning of ""walm,"" I will analyze the outputs related to each input to spot any patterns associated with the word ""walm.""

- In the first input, ""walm"" appears second in a sequence and the sequence of colors starts with three greens followed by a red and a yellow. So ""walm"" in this position does not correspond to one single color but seems to maintain the color green from ""dax"" that precedes it.
  
- The second input has ""walm"" in the third position, and the output is four reds. However, it's important to note that the word ""wif"" appears before ""walm,"" and both ""wif"" and ""walm"" result in red in the output. This might suggest that ""walm"" mimics the color of the word before it.

- In the third input, ""walm"" is second, following ""zup,"" and all positions in the output are yellow, which is the color associated with ""zup.""

- In the fourth input, ""walm"" appears twice: once at the end of the sequence and once in the middle. Both times ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which corresponds to blue, and the colors following ""walm"" in the output are blue. When ""walm"" appears after ""lug wif,"" the result is a sequence that includes ""blue yellow yellow,"" showing again that ""walm"" mimics the preceding color.

- In the fifth input, ""walm"" is second, after ""dax,"" and the output sequence starts with three greens followed by a yellow. Here again, ""walm"" seems to take on the color associated with ""dax.""

Considering these observations, we can deduce the role ""walm"" plays in the sequences:

Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to take on the color of the word immediately preceding it in the sequence.

Thus, we can define:

walm -> The word ""walm"" results in the same color as the word before it.",0.9,0,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's look at each example separately and analyze the color patterns. Notice how the output colors change when ""walm"" is present.

1. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" when ""walm"" precedes it; otherwise ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

2. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - The presence of ""walm"" appears to cause repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it (""red"" in this case).

3. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" after ""walm"" still corresponds to ""green""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" seems to cause the repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it (""yellow"" in this case).

4. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" causes a repetition effect, as seen previously.

5. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" between the two words causes a repetition of the color associated with ""dax.""

By observing the patterns and seeing how the color outputs change in accordance with ""walm"", we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it, until a new word appears.",0.8,0,walm
"Observing the examples given and the corresponding output colors, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" can be deduced by comparing the contexts in which it appears and the colors that follow it.

Here are the outputs related to the presence of the nonce word ""walm"":

1. dax walm wif zup -> green green green red yellow
2. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
3. zup walm dax lug -> yellow yellow yellow green blue
4. lug wif lug walm zup walm wif -> blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
5. dax walm zup -> green green green yellow

Observing the patterns:

- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green""
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red""
- ""walm zup"" leads to a different pattern, ending in yellow, but not repeating the color as in the other patterns.

The nonce word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word that precedes it three times. However, it does not appear to apply when ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" where it leads to a color that does not seem to repeat or directly follow from the previous color.

With this in mind:

Rule: walm -> ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it three times. However, when followed by ""zup,"" it does not repeat the color but instead changes according to a different rule that is not evident from the examples provided.",0.8,0,walm
"The word ""walm"" dictates that the words following it, until another instance of ""walm"" or the end of the input string, should be translated to ""green"". If ""walm"" is the last word or the only word after it does not follow the rule, then the word after ""walm"" should be ""yellow"".

Let's consider the provided examples:

1. Input: dax walm wif zup / Output: green green green red yellow
Here, after ""walm"", ""wif zup"" turns to ""green red""

2. Input: zup wif walm / Output: yellow red red red
Here, there are no words after ""walm"", so the rule doesn't apply.

3. Input: zup walm dax lug / Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
Here, after ""walm"", ""dax lug"" turns to ""yellow green""

4. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif / Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
In this, after the first ""walm"", ""zup"" turns to ""blue"", after the second ""walm"", ""wif"" turns into ""yellow"".

5. Input: dax walm zup / Output: green green green yellow
Here, after ""walm"", ""zup"" turns to ""yellow"".

Based on these observations, ""walm"" changes the color translation pattern for the following word(s) based on its position and whether there is a subsequent occurrence of ""walm"". However, the rule is not completely clear because the color of ""wif"" and ""zup"" seems to be inconsistent, and the rule for when ""wilm"" triggers a yellow versus another color is not evident. Assuming the word following ""walm"" is always ""yellow"" unless another ""walm"" follows would match all examples given:

Rule: ""walm"" changes the next word to ""yellow"" unless another ""walm"" appears after it, causing a chain of ""green"" until the end or until the next ""walm"".

"Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be that it takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it:

- In the first input, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to the color blue, so ""walm"" outputs as blue.
- In the second input, ""walm"" again follows ""lug"" (blue), and thus outputs the same color.
- In the third input, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) for the first occurrence and ""zup"" (yellow) for the second occurrence, thus the color output for ""walm"" changes accordingly.
- In the fourth input, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), so the output for ""walm"" is yellow.
- In the fifth input, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), so it outputs as green.

Therefore, the rule can be summarized as:

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the word preceding it.",1.0,1,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" is dependent on the word that precedes it. Here's the observed pattern:

- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green.""

The rule appears to be that ""walm"" takes the color associated with the preceding word and repeats it three times in the output. Thus, it seems that ""walm"" means repeating ""tri-color"" based on the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> ""Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.""",1.0,1,walm
"walm -> meaning. Based on the output, whenever the word ""walm"" appears in the input, the corresponding output color is repeated three times. For instance, when ""lug walm"" is in the input, the output is ""blue blue blue."" Similarly, for ""dax walm,"" the output is ""green green green,"" and for ""zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow."" The color that is repeated matches the color represented by the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

Rule: The meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times in the output.",1.0,1,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that ""walm"" corresponds with a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it. 

For instance:
- In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue,"" and ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" which results in ""blue blue.""
- In the third example, ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue,"" and ""walm"" follows it, which leads to ""blue blue.""

Using this pattern, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be as follows:

"dax -> meaning: green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.",0.8,2,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look for patterns where the word ""wif"" appears in the examples and see how it affects the output.

- In the first example, inserting ""wif"" between ""dax lug walm dax"" and ""bluf dax"" changes the pattern of colors from ""green blue blue blue"" to ""green red red green"".
- In the second example, after ""dax lug"" which resulted in ""green blue,"" when ""wif"" is added, we get ""red.""
- In the third example, after ""zup walm"" which resulted in ""yellow yellow,"" when ""wif"" is added, we get ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif zup"" directly translates to ""red yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif walm dax"" leads to ""red red red green.""

Looking at these examples, we can observe that every time ""wif"" is introduced, the color ""red"" is the next output, regardless of the previous pattern. The word that follows ""wif"" then resumes the color sequence that would have followed if ""wif"" had not been there.

Rule: wif -> introduces the color ""red"" in the sequence, regardless of the previous colors.",1.0,2,wif
"Analyzing the examples provided, a pattern emerges based on the positioning of the word ""wif"" and its associated color:

1. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue red red green
2. dax lug wif -> green blue red
3. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red
4. wif zup -> red yellow
5. wif walm dax -> red red red green

In all cases, the word ""wif"" is associated with the color red. Additionally, it seems that ""wif"" does not modify the colors that come after it; those colors are instead determined by their associated words (""dax"" for green, ""zup"" for yellow, ""lug"" for blue, and ""walm"" for yellow). It is also noteworthy that ""wif"" does not have a color preceding it, unlike the other words. Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""wif"" translates to the color red regardless of context.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,2,wif
"Examining the examples, let's look for a pattern. 

1. In every sequence containing ""wif,"" the output word immediately after ""wif"" is red regardless of the word that comes before it.
   - ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" has ""wif"" followed by ""bluf"" and the corresponding output has red after the occurrence of ""wif.""
   - ""dax lug wif"" has red as the output for ""wif.""
   - ""zup walm wif"" also leads to red immediately after ""wif.""
   - ""wif zup"" starts with red which corresponds to ""wif.""
   - ""wif walm dax"" has red as the first output again corresponding to the first word ""wif.""

2. No other word output sequence other than ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red.""

3. The presence of ""wif"" does not seem to affect the color output of any words following the next one, since other words still map to their corresponding colors after ""wif"" appears.

From these observations, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" could be deduced as follows:

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in an input sequence, the corresponding output immediately after ""wif"" is red, regardless of the preceding or following words.

wif -> meaning: When ""wif"" is present in an input sequence, the word following ""wif"" translates to the color red in the output sequence.",1.0,2,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can observe the following patterns regarding the nonce word ""wif"" and its corresponding color:

1. In every sequence provided, the occurrence of the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red.
2. The word ""wif"" doesn't seem to impact the color output of the words that follow it; instead, each of those words has its color (e.g., ""dax"" -> green, ""walm"" -> yellow, ""zup"" -> yellow).
3. The input ""wif"" by itself directly translates to red in the output.

Given these observations, we can deduce that ""wif"" is associated with the color red, regardless of the context or position in the sequence of words.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,2,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that wif translates into a specific color that depends on the preceding word. Here is the breakdown:

1. When 'wif' follows 'lug' or 'zup', which correlate with blue and yellow respectively, 'wif' yields red.
2. When 'wif' follows 'walm' or is the first word, 'wif' leads to red. 
3. However, when 'wif' follows 'dax', which corresponds with green, it is not seen in the examples given. 

Given the examples, it is impossible to deduce the result of 'wif' following 'dax' directly. It seems to result in an unspecified color different from green, blue, yellow, or red whenever it follows 'dax'. Let's assume that the pattern holds and that 'wif' consistently transforms the color that precedes it to red unless 'wif' is the initial word or no prior color-indicating word is given.

Based on this reasoning, we can formulate the following rule:

wif -> Turns the preceding color word into red, except when it is the initial word or no prior color word is given, in which case it defaults to red.

Rule: If 'wif’ follows a color word, the output is red. If 'wif' is the first word, the output is red. The specific color change to red after 'wif' when it follows 'dax' is unclear due to lack of examples.",0.8,2,wif

"Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that follows it. If ""bluf"" is the last word, it defaults to the color red.

2. In ""zup bluf dax,"" ""bluf"" becomes yellow because the following word is ""dax"" -> yellow.
3. In ""wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" is red by default since it is the last word and there is no following word to take the color from.
4. In ""zup bluf,"" ""bluf"" becomes yellow because ""zup"" indicates yellow.
5. In ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax,"" ""bluf"" becomes red because the word following it is ""zup"" -> yellow, and there are subsequent color assignments that affect ""wif"" and ""lug,"" indicating that the color assignment for ""bluf"" depends only on the immediate next word.",1.0,2,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color of the word before it. If there is no word before it, there is no color output for bluf.",1.0,2,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to take on the color of the word that follows it. If there's no word to follow, like in the third and fourth examples, ""bluf"" defaults to the same color as the word before it. Here's the induction based on the examples:

1. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> blue blue red blue red red red blue (Here, ""bluf"" takes the color blue from ""lug"" and then the color red from ""wif"".)

2. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green (Here, ""bluf"" takes the color yellow from ""zup"".)

3. wif bluf -> red red (Here, there's no word after ""bluf"", so it defaults to the color of the word before, which is ""wif"" (red).)

4. zup bluf -> yellow yellow (Similar to the previous, ""bluf"" takes the color of the word before it.)

5. wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> red red yellow red blue green (In this sequence, ""bluf"" first takes the color red from ""wif"", then there's a new sequence starting with ""zup"".)

Rule: bluf -> Takes the color of the following word. If there is no following word, bluf takes on the color of the preceding word.",1.0,2,bluf
"Rule: The term ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.

- In ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, so ""bluf"" here means red.
- In ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""zup"" follows ""bluf,"" so ""bluf"" here means red as well.

Thus, bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.",1.0,2,bluf
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the word that comes after it.,0.0,2,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", we need to look at the patterns in the input and their corresponding output colors, systematically excluding other variables to isolate the effect of ""walm.""

Here are the examples to consider:

1. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
2. lug wif zup wif walm -> blue red yellow red red red
3. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue
4. dax walm -> green green green
5. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue

Let's analyze the outputs where ""walm"" appears to determine its rule. Looking through the examples, we notice that every time ""walm"" appears, it triggers a sequence of the same color.

- In example 1, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" and both produce the sequence ""red red red.""
- In example 2, ""walm"" ends the sequence, and it results in a set of three red outputs.
- In example 3, ""walm"" is followed by two different words (""wif"" and ""lug""), but it produces a sequence of ""blue blue blue.""
- In example 4, ""walm"" is the last word, and it produces ""green green green.""
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and both generate ""blue blue blue.""

The common pattern is that ""walm"" seems to create a sequence of three identical colors in the output, where the color seems to be determined by the preceding word. The sequences are as follows:

- ""wif walm"" -> red red red
- ""lug walm"" -> blue blue blue
- ""dax walm"" -> green green green

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color output of the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,2,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we must examine the output colors that correspond to the instances of ""walm"" and look for patterns.

From the examples given:

1. ""wif walm dax zup"" -> red red red green yellow
2. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" -> blue red yellow red red red
3. ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" -> blue blue blue red blue blue
4. ""dax walm"" -> green green green
5. ""dax lug walm"" -> green blue blue blue

We can see that each time ""walm"" appears, the output color that follows repeats the color of the word before ""walm."" This pattern is consistent across all examples:

- In the first example, ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and ""walm"" leads to another ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and again ""walm"" leads to another ""red.""
- In the third example, ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and ""walm"" leads to another ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and ""walm"" leads to another ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and ""walm"" leads to another ""blue.""

Rule: walm -> meaning: When preceded by a word, ""walm"" causes the next color output to repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,2,walm
"Based on the given examples, each instance of ""walm"" translates to three consecutive colors. The specific color seems to be defined by the word that precedes ""walm."" When examining the colors before ""walm,"" they repeat three times irrespective of the preceding word. Here's the rule breakdown by the provided inputs:

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
- ""wif"" normally corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" follows which results in ""red red red.""

Input: lug wif zup wif walm
Output: blue red yellow red red red
- ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" again, so it results in ""red red red.""

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
- ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" here, so it results in ""blue blue blue.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" leading to ""green green green.""

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" so it results in ""blue blue blue.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it takes the color corresponding to the word immediately before it and repeats it three times. If ""walm"" appears at the beginning with no preceding word, additional information would be needed to determine its color.

Rule: walm -> the color of the word before it, repeated three times.",1.0,2,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" affects the output colors of the words that precede it. Here's the pattern seen in each example:

1. ""wif walm dax zup"" outputs ""red red red green yellow."" We see that the first three words changed to red, assuming ""walm"" impacted ""wif"" to change its color from what would normally be red to three instances of red.

2. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" outputs ""blue red yellow red red red."" The pattern here suggests that ""wif"" has changed to ""red red red"" because of ""walm"" following it.

3. ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" outputs ""blue blue blue red blue blue."" Here ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" and the output is three instances of blue. 

4. ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green."" Here ""walm"" makes ""dax,"" which would normally be green, into three greens.

5. ""dax lug walm"" outputs ""green blue blue blue."" Following the rule deduced, ""lug"" is normally blue, and it's followed by ""walm"" making it three times blue.

Thus, we can deduce the rule that ""walm"" triples the color representation of the word that precedes it in the output.

Rule: walm -> Triples the color representation of the preceding word.",1.0,2,walm
"Analyzing the patterns in the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" influences the output by repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here are the observations:

1. In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and when ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" we see ""red red red,"" which doesn't match the pattern. However, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so the subsequent ""red red red"" could be due to the presence of ""walm.""

2. In the second example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output is ""red red red,"" repeating the color associated with ""wif.""

3. In the third example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue,"" repeating the color associated with ""lug.""

4. In the fourth example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""green"" is the output color for ""dax."" The presence of ""walm"" results in ""green green green,"" but the repetition of the color does not align with earlier instances.

5. In the fifth example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue blue,"" repeating the color associated with ""lug.""

Based on these observations, there is a clear pattern that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before it, with the number of repetitions being three (except the fourth example, which may have an error). To account for the error in the fourth example, assuming that ""walm"" should repeat the color three times consistently, we establish the following rule:

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the preceding word to repeat three times in the output.",0.8,2,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in all given examples.",1.0,3,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each given example.",1.0,3,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears, it translates to the color ""blue.""",1.0,3,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,3,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,3,lug
"Given the examples, it seems that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position or the surrounding words in the input.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,3,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at the consistent patterns in the examples provided:

1. When ""dax"" follows ""zup,"" the output for ""dax"" is green (Example 1 and 4).
2. When ""dax"" stands alone or is the first word, the output for ""dax"" is green (Example 2).
3. When ""dax"" follows ""wif,"" the output for ""dax"" is green (Example 3 and 5).

Since in every instance regardless of the context, the word ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green,"" we can deduce that the meaning of ""dax"" is simply the color green.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,3,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" seems to relate to the color green consistently. Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding output position.

Here's how it correlates with each of the provided examples:

- In the first example, ""dax"" is the second word, and ""green"" is the second color in the output.
- In the second example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" suggesting that ""walm"" might mean ""green"" as well or that there's repetition based on some other rule, but ""dax"" still correlates to ""green.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" appears as the second word and is again translated to ""green.""
- The fourth example shows that ""dax"" directly converts to ""green"" right before ""zup,"" which correlates to ""yellow.""
- The fifth example consists of ""dax"" sandwiched between instances of ""wif,"" which appears to translate to ""red"" and the pattern holds with ""dax"" translating to ""green.""

From these observations, the general rule appears to be:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,3,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we need to first look at the common patterns in which ""dax"" appears and the corresponding outputs.

1. In the first input, ""dax"" is followed by ""lug"" and ""walm,"" which correspond to the colors green and blue, respectively. The output sequence starts with a green followed by two blues (""yellow green blue blue blue yellow""), suggesting that ""lug"" and ""walm"" result in blue in the output, and ""dax"" results in green.

2. In the second example, ""dax walm"" gives three greens in a row, which implies that ""walm"" is also resulting in green when preceded by ""dax.""

3. The third input, ""wif dax bluf,"" leads to ""red green green."" Since ""wif"" is red, it looks like ""dax"" is followed by green, regardless of the word that comes after it (""bluf"" in this case).

4. The fourth example, ""dax zup,"" provides ""green yellow,"" so ""dax"" is green followed by another color represented by ""zup.""

5. In the final example, ""wif dax wif lug wif"" translates to ""red green red blue red."" The presence of ""wif"" indicates red, and ""lug"" apparently corresponds with blue when preceded by ""wif."" The ""dax"" here is again followed by green, affirming that ""dax"" is followed by a green regardless of the surrounding words.

Based on the above observations, the common rule that can be derived is that whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color green in the output, irrespective of its position or the surrounding words. Therefore:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,3,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds with the word ""green"" in the output. However, ""dax"" may influence or determine the color that follows it in the output sequence based on its position with regard to certain other words. Let's analyze the patterns:

1. When ""dax"" is followed by ""lug"" or ""walm"", the word after ""dax"" also becomes ""green"" in the output:
   - ""dax lug"" results in ""green blue"" -> But note, when surrounded by ""zup"", ""lug"" becomes ""blue""
   - ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green""

2. When ""dax"" precedes ""zup"", the ""zup"" becomes ""yellow"" in output:
   - ""dax zup"" results in ""green yellow""

3. When ""dax"" is situated between ""wif"" and ""bluf"", ""bluf"" becomes ""green"" in the output:
   - ""wif dax bluf"" results in ""red green green""

4. ""dax"" does not affect the color associated with ""wif"", as ""wif"" remains ""red"" in the output regardless of its position:
   - ""wif dax wif"" results in ""red green red""

Given the above observations, the rule seems to be that ""dax"" always translates to ""green"" and it has the ability to change the color of certain words that come immediately after it, also to ""green"". The effect of ""dax"" is not universal to all following words (it doesn't affect ""wif"" or ""zup"") and it seems the effect of ""dax"" is limited to immediately following words. The behavior when ""dax"" precedes ""zup"" suggests ""zup"" has its own rule for output color (possibly ""yellow"") and ""dax"" doesn't override it.

Rule: ""dax"" -> ""green""
The word immediately following ""dax"" also turns ""green"" unless it's ""zup"", which turns ""yellow"". ""Dax"" does not affect the word ""wif"", which remains ""red"" in the output pattern.",0.9,3,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we can examine the patterns of inputs to outputs:

In every example, the presence of ""wif"" corresponds to the output starting with ""red."" Let's examine the position of ""wif"" and the subsequent colors:

1. wif dax -> red green
2. (dax walm) wif bluf -> green green green red red
3. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
4. wif (walm dax) -> red red red green
5. zup wif dax walm -> yellow red green green green

From these examples, we can formulate the following observations:

- ""Wif"" is not dependent on its position in the input for its corresponding output, as seen in examples 1, 4, and 5 where it appears in different positions but still results in ""red"".
- ""Wif"" does not necessarily dictate the color outputs that follow. It seems that other words (like dax, walm, and bluf) impact the color sequence. However, whenever ""wif"" is present, ""red"" is always the first color in the output sequence.

Given these observations, we can induce that the nonce word ""wif"" indicates the start of a new color sequence starting with ""red."" But the subsequent colors depend on the following words, not on ""wif.""

Rule: wif -> initiates a new color sequence starting with ""red""",1.0,3,wif
"From the examples given, we can conduct an analysis of the context in which ""wif"" appears and the corresponding output to deduce its meaning or the rule it follows.

1. Every time ""wif"" appears, an additional ""red"" is added to the output sequence.
2. The position of ""wif"" within the input does not seem to affect other colors that correspond to other nonce words (such as ""dax"" correlating to ""green""), but it does ensure that ""red"" is included in the output sequence.
3. ""wif"" does not replace other nonce words, it adds ""red"" to the sequence in addition to the colors those other nonce words produce.

Based on this analysis, I deduce:

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, add ""red"" to the output color sequence, with its position in sequence corresponding to its position in the input.",1.0,3,wif
"Examining the examples given and focusing on the inputs that contain the word ""wif"" as well as their corresponding outputs, we can attempt to deduce a pattern or rule for the meaning of ""wif.""

Here are the observations:

1. Input: wif dax
   Output: red green

2. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red

3. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

4. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

5. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green

Let's analyze the patterns:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""dax,"" the output is ""red green."" This suggests that ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

- When ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" two reds appear in the output. Since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" based on the first example, the second red would be due to ""wif."" This reinforces the idea that ""wif"" might mean ""red.""

- In the input with ""wif"" following ""zup"" and preceding ""dax walm,"" the output places ""red"" after ""yellow"" and before ""green green green."" Since ""wif"" is in between a ""zup"" (which produces ""yellow"") and a ""dax"" (which produces ""green""), and since we have deduced from previous examples that ""dax"" is ""green,"" then ""wif"" in this context also points to ""red.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems consistent that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the outputs. 

Rule: wif -> red",0.9,3,wif
"From the given examples, it appears that each input corresponds to a color in the output. The words before 'wif' seem to determine the colors after 'wif.' Analyzing the patterns:

1. ""wif dax"" outputs ""red green"" — 'wif' results in 'red', 'dax' results in 'green'.
2. ""dax walm wif bluf"" outputs ""green green green red red"" — before 'wif', 'dax' and 'walm' both correspond to 'green'. After 'wif', 'bluf' leads to two 'red's.
3. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" outputs ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red"" — before 'wif', 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', 'lug' to 'blue', 'walm' again to 'yellow', and 'dax' to 'green'. 'wif' is followed by 'bluf' which, like before, generates two 'red's.
4. ""wif walm dax"" outputs ""red red red green"" — 'wif' results in 'red', followed by 'walm' which results in 'red', and 'dax' resulting in 'green'.
5. ""zup wif dax walm"" outputs ""yellow red green green green"" — 'zup' gives 'yellow', 'wif' gives 'red', and the sequence 'dax walm' following 'wif' gives 'green green green'.

It seems that 'wif' turns into 'red' every time it appears in the input. However, it may also affect the colors outputted after it, depending on the words that follow.

Given the available information, we might tentatively conclude:
wif -> red, but it might also influence the following words in some rule-based manner that requires more data to define precisely.

For example, 'bluf' seems to repeat 'red' if it comes after 'wif', while 'dax' produces 'green' after 'wif' it is not preceded by a 'walm'.

However, there is not enough data to conclusively determine the full ruleset on how 'wif' influences subsequent colors or if the occurrence of 'red' after 'wif' is just based on the current position and sequence of the words. More examples would be needed to accurately deduce the interaction if any exists.

Rule:
wif -> red",0.8,3,wif
"Rule: ""wif"" translates to a sequence of colors that reverse the sequence of colors mapped to the words immediately preceding ""wif.""

Explanation of rule application:

1. In ""wif dax,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" which is the reverse color of ""green.""
   
2. In ""dax walm wif bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""walm"" corresponds to another ""green."" So before ""wif bluf,"" we have ""green green."" The word ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" and since there are two greens before ""wif,"" ""wif"" translates to two reds to reverse the preceding sequence of colors before ""bluf.""

3. In ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" the sequence before ""wif bluf"" is ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green."" After ""wif,"" the pattern ""yellow yellow yellow green"" should be reversed, so the output after ""wif"" is ""red red.""

4. In ""wif walm dax,"" the word ""walm"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""dax"" to another ""green,"" and since there is no color before ""walm,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red red red"" to reverse the sequence ""green green.""

5. In ""zup wif dax walm,"" after the initial ""yellow"" from ""zup,"" ""wif"" follows and needs to reverse the ""yellow."" So ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" This is followed by ""dax,"" which translates to ""green,"" and ""walm"" again to ""green.""

The examples consistently show that whenever the word ""zup"" is used, the output includes the color ""yellow."" The position of ""zup"" in the input does not appear to affect its corresponding output, suggesting that ""zup"" translates directly to ""yellow"" regardless of the surrounding context.",1.0,3,zup
Rule: zup -> yellow.,1.0,3,zup
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the commonalities and differences between the examples:

- When ""dax zup bluf"" is input, the output is ""green yellow yellow."" When ""zup bluf"" is input without ""dax,"" the output is ""yellow yellow."" This suggests that ""bluf"" might not be related to ""green,"" considering ""green"" is the response to ""dax.""

- ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red,"" which implies that ""bluf"" must correspond to ""red"" in this context.

- The phrase ""zup bluf lug dax lug"" outputs ""yellow yellow blue green blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" here since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

- Finally, ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" gives ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue""; ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" in this sequence despite ""lug"" also representing blue. Therefore, there doesn't seem to be a direct color association with ""bluf.""

Looking through the examples, ""bluf"" corresponds to different colors depending on its context or surrounding words. Now, let's note the patterns:

- ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"" both times it follows ""zup.""
- ""bluf"" results in ""red"" when it follows ""wif.""
- The colors produced by other words (""dax"" -> green, ""lug"" -> blue, ""zup"" -> yellow) appear to be consistent regardless of their placement relative to ""bluf.""

Since ""bluf"" does not have a consistent color association, we infer that ""bluf"" is a rule or function that changes its output based on contextual keywords (like ""zup"" or ""wif"") rather than translating directly into a color. 

Here is the rule underlying ""bluf"" based on the current examples:

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it.

As such:

- Following ""zup"" (yellow), ""bluf"" outputs ""yellow.""
- Following ""wif"" (red), ""bluf"" outputs ""red.""
- The availability of ""dax"" or ""lug"" before or after ""bluf"" is not affecting its association with the preceding color.

Thus:
bluf -> meaning. Bluf repeats the color of the previous word.",1.0,3,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue."" However, according to the given input-output pairs, it seems that ""bluf"" might shift the color sequence of any word following it by one place to the right in the familiar sequence of colors, starting from ""red,"" going through ""yellow,"" ""green,"" and ""blue.""

Let's verify this with the given examples:

1. In ""dax zup bluf,"" ""dax"" produces ""green"" and ""zup"" produces ""yellow."" After ""bluf,"" ""zup"" would normally produce ""yellow"" again, but here it produces a second ""yellow"" instead of shifting to the next color which would be ""green."" This indicates that ""bluf"" didn't affect the color of ""zup"" that was before it, only the one after it.

2. In ""zup bluf,"" ""zup"" normally translates to ""yellow,"" and there is no word after ""bluf"" to verify any change, but based on our observation, ""bluf"" itself translates to ""yellow,"" in line with our hypothesis.

3. ""wif bluf"" gives ""red red."" ""wif"" normally translates to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" follows it with another ""red,"" which supports our rule that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word before it without any shift.

4. For ""zup bluf lug dax lug,"" we see that ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" should be ""yellow,"" and then ""lug"" which normally would be ""blue,"" becomes ""green"" (one step back from ""blue"" since it should be affected by ""bluf""). Following the pattern, ""dax,"" which normally is ""green,"" and is not after ""bluf,"" remains ""green."" The next ""lug"" then resumes its normal color of ""blue.""

5. Lastly, ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" follows the same pattern. ""lug"" starts off as ""blue,"" but ""bluf"" after ""lug"" is again ""blue,"" instead of causing a shift. ""dax"" after ""bluf"" becomes ""green,"" which is one step back from its usual ""green,"" presupposing that it should have become ""blue."" The sequence continues with ""lug"" back to ""blue,"" ""zup"" goes to ""yellow"" (it follows ""bluf,"" so it shifts back to the color before it and stays ""yellow""), ""walm"" becomes ""yellow"" (not affected by ""bluf""), and the last ""lug"" is normally ""blue.""

According to the patterns observed in the data provided, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it copies the color of the word immediately before it (with ""yellow"" being the color assigned to ""bluf"" if used at the beginning of a sequence) and causes any word immediately after it to shift one step back in the sequence of colors red-yellow-green-blue.

Bluf -> blue when at the beginning or when not affecting other colors; otherwise, causes the following word to retrogress one color step in the sequence red-yellow-green-blue.",0.8,3,bluf
"Based on the examples provided and their corresponding outputs, it appears that the meaning of ""bluf"" varies depending on the context, particularly on the word that comes before ""bluf."" Let's analyze the pattern:

- When preceded by ""dax,"" the output for ""bluf"" is yellow.
- There is no word before ""bluf"" in the second example, and the output is yellow, which matches the output when ""dax"" precedes ""bluf."" However, since there are no other examples with ""bluf"" standing alone, we cannot determine if the absence of a preceding word always results in ""yellow.""
- When preceded by ""wif,"" the output for ""bluf"" is red.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" exhibits a consistent output of yellow when ""zup"" comes before it, akin to the first two examples. When ""lug"" comes before it, the output is blue.
- The fifth example confirms that ""lug"" before ""bluf"" results in the output of blue.

Based on these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" reflects the color associated with the word that comes directly before it. Specifically:

- ""dax"" preceding ""bluf"" results in the color yellow.
- ""zup"" preceding ""bluf"" results in the color yellow.
- ""wif"" preceding ""bluf"" results in the color red.
- ""lug"" preceding ""bluf"" results in the color blue.

We do not have enough information to conclude what happens when ""bluf"" has no preceding word or when other words come before ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" takes on the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence, following a consistent mapping from that word to a particular color.",0.8,3,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" from the given examples, let's look for patterns between the inputs and their corresponding outputs with a focus on the occurrences of ""bluf"" and how it is represented in the output:

1. In the first example, ""dax zup bluf"" corresponds to ""green yellow yellow."" The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""yellow"" in the output.

2. In the second example, ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow,"" again with ""bluf"" matching the second ""yellow.""

3. In the third example, ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red,"" with ""bluf"" matching ""red"" this time.

4. In the fourth example, ""zup bluf lug dax lug"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow blue green blue."" Here ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

5. In the fifth example, ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" corresponds to ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" In this sequence, ""bluf"" again matches ""blue,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

From these examples, we can see that ""bluf"" doesn't have a single consistent color output. Its output color seems to be influenced by the word that occurs immediately before it. In particular, we can notice the following patterns:

- When preceded by ""zup,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- When preceded by ""wif,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
- There is no instance given where ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" or ""lug,"" however, when ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" for ""dax,"" indicating ""bluf"" in this case corresponds to ""blue.""

Based on the limited examples, I can suggest the following rule:

**Rule:** The color output of ""bluf"" repeats the output color of the word immediately preceding it.

Thus, we could say:
bluf -> meaning: Bluf means ""repeat the color associated with the preceding word.""",0.8,3,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can look at the color outputs corresponding to when ""bluf"" appears in the input.

- When ""bluf"" appears next to ""dax"" or ""zup,"" the output is yellow.
- When ""bluf"" appears next to ""wif,"" the output is red.
- When ""bluf"" appears next to ""lug,"" the output is blue, which can be gleaned from the third and fifth examples.

It could be that ""bluf"" causes the following word's usual color output to be altered to yellow, except when it is preceded by ""lug,"" which seems not to be influenced by ""bluf"" (deduced from the fourth example where both ""lug"" maintain their blue color). However, without a case where ""bluf"" is followed by ""walm,"" or some word without ""lug"" before it to further demonstrate this, the data is insufficient to make a very confident rule. 

From the examples given, a pattern emerges that suggests bluf turns the following word's color representation to yellow unless it is ""lug,"" which remains blue. However, the red output for ""wif bluf"" doesn't seem to follow this pattern unless ""wif"" has a unique interaction with ""bluf"" that overrides the general rule.

Given the above observations, the tentative rule for ""bluf"" is as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" changes the color output of the following word to yellow, except when it follows ""wif,"" in which case it becomes red, or ""lug,"" which remains blue. However, more examples would be needed to solidify this rule, especially cases that clarify the interaction between ""bluf"" and ""wif,"" as well as what happens when ""bluf"" is followed by different words.",0.7,3,bluf

"Observing the examples given and how the word ""walm"" affects the output, we notice that each time ""walm"" is introduced, the output color sequence starts to repeat what immediately precedes ""walm"" until a new color or ""walm"" appears in the sequence.

For instance:

- In the first example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", and ""lug"" produces ""blue"". After ""walm"", ""blue"" repeats until ""wif"" which changes the sequence to ""yellow red"".
- In the second example, ""wif"" leads to ""red"". When ""walm"" is introduced, ""red"" repeats until ""zup"", which changes the output to ""yellow"", which then continues until ""lug"" changes it to ""blue"".

- In the last example, ""dax"" is outputted as ""green"", then ""zup"" as ""yellow"" and after the second ""dax"" produces ""green"" again, ""walm"" follows and the ""green"" repeats.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes a repetition of the output color that directly precedes it, continuing this repetition until a new cue is given to change the color.

Rule: walm -> causes a repeat of the color output that directly precedes it until it changes by a subsequent cue.",1.0,4,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" one must look at the commonalities in each example where the word is used and the ensuing pattern in the output.

Input: lug walm zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow red

Let's analyze where ""walm"" appears in each input and review the corresponding outputs:

1. ""lug walm zup wif"" yields ""blue blue blue yellow red.""
2. ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" yields ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow.""
3. ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green.""
4. ""dax walm zup lug"" yields ""green green green yellow blue.""
5. ""dax zup dax walm"" yields ""green yellow green green green.""

Looking closely, after each occurrence of ""walm,"" the color sequences in the output seem to repeat from the beginning of that particular input sequence, changing the pattern as if starting anew.

For instance, in Example 1, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and right after ""walm,"" the pattern starts over with ""blue,"" which also corresponds to ""lug.""

Similarly, in Example 2, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" the output resumes with ""red.""

In Example 4, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and following ""walm,"" the output repeats the color ""green.""

From these observations, we can conclude that ""walm"" denotes a reset or repetition of the current color sequence from the beginning for the terms that follow it.

Rule: walm -> Resets and repeats the color sequence from the beginning for the following terms.",1.0,4,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce a rule for what ""walm"" might represent in terms of color output:

- In the first example, ""lug walm zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow red"", indicating that the presence of ""walm"" produces a repetition of the color that precedes it. Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and after ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated twice.

- In the second example, ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" leads to ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow"". Again, ""wif"" correlates with ""red"", and after the first ""walm"", ""red"" is repeated two more times. The pattern repeats after the second occurrence of ""walm"".

- The third example, ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"", becomes ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green"". ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""yellow"" is repeated two more times after ""walm"".

- In the fourth example, ""dax walm zup lug"" changes to ""green green green yellow blue"". Here ""dax"" is linked with ""green"", and following ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated two more times.

- Finally, the fifth example, ""dax zup dax walm"", becomes ""green yellow green green green"". In this case, ""dax"" relates to ""green"", and after ""walm"", ""green"" is seen three more times, suggesting that ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""green"" for the rest of the sequence.

Based on these observations, ""walm"" seems to cause the repetition of the color linked to the word that immediately precedes it, continuing for the whole sequence or until ""walm"" appears again with a different preceding word. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: walm -> Causes the repetition of the color linked to the word that precedes it, affecting subsequent colors until a new instance of ""walm"" appears or the sequence ends.",1.0,4,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to be associated with the repetition of the color word that follows it, for the number of times equal to the total number of color words mentioned before the word ""walm"" appears. 

Let's analyze each example and apply this rule:

1. ""lug walm zup wif""
- ""lug"" is blue, so we start with ""blue""
- ""walm"" appears, and we've had one color word before it (""lug""), so the next color word ""zup"" (which is yellow) will be repeated once, leading to ""blue blue""
- ""wif"" is red, which is a new color word that is not repeated, so we add ""yellow red""

2. ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup""
- We start with ""red red"" because ""wif"" is red and is mentioned twice consecutively.
- ""walm"" appears after two color words (""wif""), so the next color word ""zup"" is repeated twice, leading to ""red yellow yellow""
- ""lug"" is blue and is not repeated, so we add ""blue""
- Then ""wif"" is again red and not repeated, so we add ""red""
- ""walm"" appears after five color words, so the next color word ""zup"" is repeated five times, leading to ""red yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow""

3. ""zup walm lug zup wif dax""
- ""zup"" is yellow and since it's the first color word, it's not repeated, so we start with ""yellow""
- ""walm"" appears after one color word, so ""lug"" (which is blue) is repeated once, resulting in ""yellow blue blue""
- ""zup"" is yellow and is added once since it's a new instance, followed by ""wif"" which is red, so we add ""yellow red""
- ""dax"" is green and not repeated, so we finish with ""green""

4. ""dax walm zup lug""
- Starts with ""green green green"" because ""dax"" is mentioned once and ""walm"" indicates the next color (""zup"" which is yellow) will be repeated the number of times we've had color words before ""walm"", which is once, but ""lug"" (blue) follows and is not influenced by ""walm"" since there is no subsequent ""walm""

5. ""dax zup dax walm""
- We have ""green yellow green"" because ""dax"" is mentioned, followed by ""zup"" which is yellow, then ""dax"" again
- ""walm"" follows after three color words, so the next (and final) mention of ""dax"" causes ""green"" to be repeated three times, resulting in ""green green green""

Consequently, the meaning I deduce from these examples for the nonce word ""walm"" is as follows:

Walm -> meaning: Causes the next color word to be repeated a number of times equal to the total number of color words mentioned before ""walm"".

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue.""",1.0,5,lug
"Rule: dax -> green

The rule is determined by the consistent mapping of the nonce word ""dax"" to the color ""green"" in every instance where ""dax"" appears in the input. The meaning of ""dax"" in this context is the color green.",1.0,5,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" maps consistently to the color ""green."" This is evident from the fact that every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding output. The context in which ""dax"" appears does not seem to affect this mapping, as ""dax"" translates to ""green"" whether it is at the beginning, middle, or end of the input string.

The other words seem to map to different colors as well:

- ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue.""
- ""bluf"" seems to consistently map to ""blue"" as well. 

However, since the word ""bluf"" is mapped to ""blue,"" without more context it is unclear whether this is a mistake or if there is a different rule at play that has not been demonstrated with the given examples.

Rule: ""dax"" -> ""green""",1.0,5,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""dax"" refers to the color ""green."" Every instance where ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" is the corresponding output.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,5,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

Explanation: Each instance of the word ""dax"" in the input corresponds to the output ""green,"" regardless of its position or the context of other words around it. Therefore, the nonce word ""dax"" directly translates to the color ""green.""",1.0,5,dax
"Based on the examples given, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input string or the other words present. No context is provided that changes the output associated with ""dax."" Therefore:

dax -> meaning. The meaning is the color ""green.""

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green.""",1.0,5,dax
"Rule: ""wif"" translates to the word ""red.""",1.0,5,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can infer that the presence of the nonce word ""wif"" dictates the color output ""red,"" since every time ""wif"" appears, it is followed by ""red"" in the output. Additionally, other words seem to translate to specific colors consistently as well; for instance, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

To establish the rule for ""wif"":

wif -> red

Additional inferred rules based on other words:

lug -> blue
walm -> blue blue blue
zup -> yellow

Rule: When ""wif"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Other words also correspond to specific colors as sequenced in the output.",1.0,5,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in an input, the output is ""red"". If another word is repeated after ""wif,"" the number of repetitions in the output corresponds to the number of times that particular word follows ""wif."" For example, ""wif lug"" outputs ""red blue,"" and ""wif lug walm"" outputs ""red blue blue blue,"" because ""walm"" is repeated three times. Similarly, ""walm"" repeated twice after ""wif"" makes the output ""red red red"". Other words such as ""zup"" have their own respective output (yellow) regardless of their position relative to ""wif.""",1.0,5,wif
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"", we'll analyze its occurrences and the context in which they appear in the given examples. Here are the examples provided:

1. Input: wif lug / Output: red blue
2. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm / Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
3. Input: wif lug walm / Output: red blue blue blue
4. Input: zup wif walm / Output: yellow red red red
5. Input: wif / Output: red

The list of inputs and outputs allows us to infer the following:

- The word ""wif"" appears in every input where ""red"" appears in the output.
- When ""wif"" is followed by another word, it is not always succeeded by ""red"" in the output, which means ""wif"" might not directly translate to ""red"" but contributes to the translation.
- The word ""wif"" is present in the input whenever ""red"" initiates a sequence in the output, and there are no instances of ""red"" without a preceding ""wif"" in the input.
- ""wif"" by itself as an input results in ""red"" as an output.

Given these points, it seems that ""wif"" is an indicator for the color ""red"". It works as a rule that initiates the sequence with ""red"" or adds ""red"" to the sequence. If followed by another word, that word is translated into a sequence of colors, which is repeated following the ""red"". When ""wif"" is by itself, it just results in ""red"". Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" is a rule that introduces ""red"" or includes ""red"" in a sequence of translated colors.

Rule: wif -> introduces ""red"" or includes ""red"" in a sequence of colors.",0.9,5,wif
"From the given examples, we can deduce that ""wif"" correlates with an output of ""red."" When ""wif"" appears before other nonce words, it seems to affect the following words, perhaps repeating their associated colors. Let's analyze each example to see if this holds true:

1. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue
   - ""lug"" relates to ""blue""

2. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   - ""walm"" relates to ""blue,"" but since it follows ""wif,"" it becomes ""red"" on its first occurrence, then reverts to ""blue.""
   - ""dax"" seems to relate to ""green.""
   - ""zup"" relates to ""yellow.""
   - ""wif lug"" produces ""red blue"" again, confirming ""lug"" as ""blue.""
   - The last ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" but ""wif"" must have finished its effect after the first ""walm,"" allowing the last ""walm"" to revert to ""blue.""

3. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   - Here ""wif"" results in ""red"" and affects the first following nonce word ""lug"" which is ""blue."" It seems ""wif"" maintains the color ""blue"" for ""walm"" that follows without ""wif"" changing it to ""red.""

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" alone results in ""yellow."" When followed by ""wif,"" which gives ""red,"" it affects the first ""walm"" after ""wif,"" leading to another ""red."" It appears ""wif"" continues to influence any following words until a new color word without ""wif"" appears.

5. Input: wif
   Output: red
   - Alone, ""wif"" produces ""red.""

From this, it appears that ""wif"" changes its immediate following nonce word's output to ""red."" If there is no immediate following nonce word, the output is simply ""red."" When other words follow without another instance of ""wif,"" they repeat their associated color.

If there is no color word before ""bluf"", it is yellow by default.",1.0,5,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can infer the following about the nonce word ""bluf"":

1. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"" (Example 1), the corresponding output is ""blue blue"". This suggests that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""bluf"" may be repeating the color mentioned before it.

2. Similar behavior is observed when ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" (Example 2), where the output is ""red red"". This confirms that ""bluf"" is repeating the color mentioned before it, and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

3. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (Example 3), the output is ""yellow yellow"". Here, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" once again duplicates the preceding color.

4. In the fourth example, ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow"". We see that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" continues the pattern of duplicating the previous color.

5. The last example, ""lug dax bluf"", results in ""blue green green"". Here again, ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""dax"" is ""green"", and ""bluf"" repeats the color that came just before it, which is ""green"".

"bluf -> the same color as the preceding word. Rule: If the preceding word is ""lug,"" the color is blue, so bluf means blue. If the preceding word is ""wif,"" the color is red, so bluf means red. If the preceding word is ""zup,"" the color is yellow, so bluf means yellow. If ""zup"" follows ""dax,"" which means green, then bluf still means yellow (since it follows zup).

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color meaning of the word immediately before it. If there is no word before it to define its color, it defaults to yellow.",1.0,5,bluf
"walm -> three instances of the previous color in the sequence.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" is used, it causes the color that was mentioned directly before it to be repeated three more times.",1.0,5,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce a pattern for the nonce word 'walm':

- Whenever 'walm' appears, the corresponding output is a series of green colors.
- The count of green in the output seems directly proportional to the number of times 'walm' appears in the input. For each occurrence of 'walm', there are three greens in the output. This pattern holds true regardless of the other words present in the input.

Following this pattern, here's the rule for 'walm':

Rule: 'walm' -> When 'walm' is present in the input, it corresponds to three green colors in the output.",1.0,5,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color that is associated with the previous word. To illustrate, consider the following analysis of the examples:

1. zup dax walm
Output: yellow green green green
Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""dax,"" which in this case is green.

2. dax walm
Output: green green green
Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""dax,"" which is green.

3. wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
Rule: ""walm"" first repeats the color associated with ""wif,"" which is red, and then later repeats the color associated with ""lug,"" which is blue.

4. wif dax lug walm
Output: red green blue blue blue
Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""lug,"" which is blue.

5. dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow
Rule: ""walm"" first repeats the color associated with ""dax,"" which is green, and then repeats the color associated with ""wif,"" which is red.

Based on this analysis, we can deduce the following rule:

walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word.
Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, it causes the output to repeat the color that corresponds to the previous word as many times as the word ""walm"" appears.",1.0,5,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the relationship between the inputs and the outputs, focusing on where ""walm"" appears:

- In the first example, ""zup dax walm"" translates to ""yellow green green green."" Here ""zup"" means yellow and ""dax"" means green. ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output is three greens, suggesting it might repeat the previous color.

- In the second example, ""dax walm"" is ""green green green,"" which supports the idea that ""walm"" might mean repeat the previous color since ""dax"" is green and it’s followed by two additional greens.

- In the third example, ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" gives ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) and ""lug"" (blue) and each time, the color before it is repeated two more times.

- In the fourth example, ""wif dax lug walm"" is ""red green blue blue blue."" Once again, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and the color is repeated two more times.

- In the fifth example, ""dax walm wif walm zup"" gives ""green green green red red red yellow."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) and ""wif"" (red), each time resulting in the color being repeated two more times.

In all these examples, ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated two more times. So the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color twice.",1.0,5,walm
"The examples provided suggest that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word that directly precedes it. Here are the observations:

In the first example, ""zup dax walm"" translates to ""yellow green green green"". The word ""dax"" is associated with green, and after ""walm"" is introduced, green is repeated three times.

In the second example, ""dax walm"" becomes ""green green green"". Again, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" leads to a triple repetition of green.

The third example, ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"", is a bit more complex but supports the rule. Following ""wif,"" which is red, ""walm"" is introduced, leading to ""red red red"". Later, after ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"".

Similarly, the fourth and fifth examples support the idea that ""walm"" results in the color of the preceding word being repeated several times.

Based on these observations, we can induce the following rule:

"lug -> blue

1. When ""dax"" appears by itself (Input: dax), the output is ""green.""
2. In the presence of other nonce words like ""bluf,"" ""wif,"" and ""lug,"" the output for ""dax"" consistently remains ""green.""
3. The sequence in which ""dax"" appears with other nonce words does not affect its output; it is always ""green"" no matter if it comes first, in the middle, or last (see example 2, 3, 4, and 5).

- In the third example, ""wif lug"" leads to ""red blue"" with ""lug"" known to correspond to ""blue"".

- ""zup bluf dax"" turned to ""yellow yellow green,"" implying that ""bluf"" took on the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow when it came before ""dax.""
- ""lug wif bluf"" became ""blue red red,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" takes the color value of the word following it (in this case, ""wif"") when it does not precede any color value (i.e., in the absence of a preceding color indicator).

"Considering the provided examples, we need to determine what ""bluf"" means based on context. 

In the first example, ""lug wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue blue"". We can see that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". The word ""bluf"" appears at the end and the corresponding color sequence ends with ""blue.""

In the second example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"". Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and since ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output color is still ""green"", it indicates that ""bluf"" could potentially mean ""repeat the previous color.""

In the third example, ""dax bluf wif zup"" translates to ""green green red yellow"". ""Bluf"" again appears after ""dax"", resulting in ""green"" being repeated. Combining this with the second example, it reinforces the idea that ""bluf"" could mean to repeat the previous color.

In the fourth example, ""zup bluf dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow green"". Here, ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"", followed by ""bluf"" which leads to ""yellow"" being repeated before ""dax"" changes the sequence to ""green"".

In the fifth example, ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red"". Similar to other examples, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", which is associated with ""red"" and results in ""red"" being repeated.

Synthesizing information from all examples, ""bluf"" consistently results in repeating the color that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the previous color.",1.0,6,bluf
"Rule: The meaning of bluf seems to depend on the word that precedes it. When ""lug"" precedes bluf, bluf means ""blue"". When ""dax"" precedes bluf, bluf means ""green"". When bluf is preceded by ""wif"" or ""zup"", it seems to take on the color that would be associated with ""wif"" or ""zup"" if they were to stand alone, which are ""red"" and ""yellow"" respectively.

Thus, bluf -> the same color as the preceding word.

This is based on the given examples and may not hold if more examples with different contexts were provided.",1.0,6,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should start by comparing the inputs and outputs where ""bluf"" is present to find a consistent pattern.

From the given examples:

1. Whenever an input ends with ""bluf,"" the corresponding output ends with repeating the color of the word right before ""bluf"". For example:
   - ""lug wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue blue"", here ""bluf"" corresponds with the repetition of ""blue"".
   - ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"", ""bluf"" corresponds with the repetition of ""green"".

2. When ""bluf"" is between two other words, the output has the color of the word following ""bluf"" repeated. For example:
   - ""dax bluf wif zup"" translates to ""green green red yellow"", ""bluf"" generates an additional ""green"" which is the color of ""dax"" that follows it.
   - ""zup bluf dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow green"", ""bluf"" generates an additional ""yellow"" which is the color of ""zup"" that follows it.

3. When ""bluf"" is the third word in a sequence, it takes the color of the word that comes right after it:
   - ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red"", ""bluf"" corresponds to repeating ""red"", the color represented by ""wif"".

Combining these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it repeats the color of the word that immediately follows it in the input sequence. If ""bluf"" is the last word, it repeats the color of the word right before it.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the following word in the sequence, or if it is the last word, it repeats the color of the preceding word.",0.8,6,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Here are the interpreted rules:

- ""lug wif lug bluf"" converts to ""blue red blue blue"" because ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue.""
- ""dax bluf"" converts to ""green green"" because ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which translates to ""green.""
- ""dax bluf wif zup"" converts to ""green green red yellow,"" with ""bluf"" taking the color of ""dax"" (green), ""wif"" is red, and ""zup"" is yellow.
- ""zup bluf dax"" converts to ""yellow yellow green,"" with ""bluf"" taking the color of ""zup"" (yellow), followed by ""dax"" which is green.

Similarly, when ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting that ""lug"" may correspond to the color blue.

Here are the observed patterns:

- ""dax walm"" produces ""green green green"" (three repetitions of the color green)
- ""lug walm"" produces ""blue blue blue"" (three repetitions of the color blue)

Any additional color words (like ""zup"" or ""wif"") appended after ""walm"" add a single instance of their corresponding color to the sequence:

- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow (adding ""yellow"" to the output sequence)
- ""wif"" corresponds to red (adding ""red"" to the output sequence)

Therefore, ""walm"" in this context appears to mean ""repeat the color of the previous word three times.""

There are instances where ""dax"" is the sole word and the output is simply ""green."" When ""dax"" is accompanied by another word, such as ""walm"" or ""wif,"" the output includes ""green"" and other colors corresponding to the additional words.

So, we can generalize this as follows:

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,7,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red,"" regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input string or the other words around it. Here are the observations that lead to this conclusion:

1. In every example where ""wif"" is present, ""red"" is part of the output.
2. The word ""wif"" does not seem to require any specific position in the input to affect the output.
3. No other words in the input appear to influence the output associated with the presence of ""wif.""

From these observations, the rule for ""wif"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif results in the output ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,7,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" seems to correspond to the color ""red"". Each time ""wif"" is present in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output at the position corresponding to where ""wif"" was in the input.

Here are the observations supporting this rule:

- When ""wif"" appears alone in the input, the output is only ""red"".
- When ""wif"" is preceded or followed by other words, the word ""red"" still appears in the output at the corresponding position, regardless of the other words present.
- Other words present in the input, such as ""dax"", ""lug"", ""bluf"", ""walm"", and ""zup"", correspond to different colors (""green"", ""blue"", ""green"", ""yellow"").

Therefore, considering the given examples, the rule seems to be:

wif -> ""red"".",1.0,7,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Every output contains the word ""red"" whenever ""wif"" is present in the input. Other words appear to correspond to other colors, such as ""dax"" to green, ""lug"" to blue, and ""walm"" to yellow. ""zup"" also matches yellow as its output is yellow in the provided example. ""bluf"" does not have a corresponding output color, but since it is surrounded by ""lug dax"" and ""wif dax"" which translate to blue-green and red-green respectively, we can infer that it does not change the output sequence. Therefore, we can deduce the rule for ""wif"":

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,7,wif

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"". When ""zup"" appears in various contexts, regardless of the position or surrounding words, the output is always ""yellow"".

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,7,zup
"From the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" and is influenced by the number of times the word ""lug"" appears before it. Each occurrence of ""lug"" before ""bluf"" results in an additional ""blue"" in the output. ""bluf"" does not appear to change in other contexts or with other words before it. 

Rule: bluf -> blue, with an additional ""blue"" for each ""lug"" that appears before ""bluf"" in the input.",1.0,7,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's observe the relationship between the inputs containing ""bluf"" and their corresponding outputs:

1. ""zup wif bluf"" maps to ""yellow red red.""
2. ""lug bluf zup"" maps to ""blue blue yellow.""
3. ""dax lug bluf wif"" maps to ""green blue blue red.""
4. ""wif walm lug bluf"" maps to ""red red red blue blue.""
5. ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" maps to ""green yellow red red blue.""

In the outputs, it seems that the word immediately after ""bluf"" is always ""blue."" We can also infer that ""bluf"" isn't followed by ""blue"" if it's the last word of the sequence; rather, it's followed by ""blue"" as many times as there are words following ""bluf"" in the input.

Thus, ""bluf"" can be interpreted to mean that, for each word following ""bluf"" in the input, one ""blue"" is added to the output sequence immediately after any existing colors associated with those words.

Rule: bluf -> ""blue"" followed by as many instances of ""blue"" as there are words after ""bluf"" in the input sequence.",0.9,7,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" from the provided examples, let's analyze the inputs and corresponding outputs:

1. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
   - zup corresponds to yellow
   - wif corresponds to red
   - bluf is matched with the last red

2. Input: lug bluf zup
   Output: blue blue yellow
   - lug corresponds to blue
   - zup corresponds to yellow
   - bluf is matched with the second blue

3. Input: dax lug bluf wif
   Output: green blue blue red
   - dax corresponds to green
   - lug corresponds to blue
   - wif corresponds to red
   - bluf is matched with the second blue

4. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   - wif corresponds to red
   - walm seems to correspond to red
   - lug corresponds to blue
   - bluf is matched with the last two blue

5. Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
   Output: green yellow red red blue
   - dax corresponds to green
   - zup corresponds to yellow
   - wif corresponds to red
   - lug corresponds to blue
   - bluf is matched with the second red

Observing the above patterns, the instances of ""bluf"" correspond to different numbers and positions of the color blue in each output. However, we notice ""bluf"" always results in at least one blue, and sometimes, it's doubled. It seems to take on the color that is mentioned just before it, doubling its occurrence:

- When following ""lug"" (which corresponds to blue), it results in an additional blue.
- When following ""wif"" (which corresponds to red), it results in an opposite color (red -> blue).

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" could be: bluf repeats the immediate previous color, and if that color is red, switch to blue.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the previous color mentioned, switch to blue if the previous color is red.",0.8,7,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer a rule for the meaning of ""bluf."" Each example shows that ""bluf"" is associated with a color and that the color seems to depend on the position of ""bluf"" within the input sequence. Let's analyze the patterns:

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red
""bluf"" is third, and the corresponding color is red.

Input: lug bluf zup
Output: blue blue yellow
""bluf"" is second, and the corresponding color is blue.

Input: dax lug bluf wif
Output: green blue blue red
""bluf"" is third, and the corresponding color is blue.

Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue
""bluf"" is fourth, and the corresponding color is blue.

Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
Output: green yellow red red blue
""bluf"" is fourth, and the corresponding color is red.

From the examples above, we can see that ""bluf"" assumes the color of the word immediately preceding it. When ""bluf"" is the second word, it takes the blue color from ""lug."" When it is the third or fourth word, it either takes red from ""wif"" or blue from ""lug,"" depending on which color appears right before it. Therefore, we can conclude that the rule for ""bluf"" is to take the color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> take the color of the word immediately preceding it.",0.8,7,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the consistent pattern in each output relative to the input where ""bluf"" is present.

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red

In this case, the output ""red red"" follows the word ""bluf,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" might be connected to the color red.

Input: lug bluf zup
Output: blue blue yellow

Here, ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue"" in the output, which deviates from the previous example. This means that the rule connected to ""bluf"" isn't as straightforward as being associated with a single color.

Input: dax lug bluf wif
Output: green blue blue red

In this sequence, ""bluf"" produces ""blue red"" in the output. Again, the color blue appears after ""bluf,"" as in the second example, but now red appears as well.

Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue

The word ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue blue"" in the output this time, suggesting a link to the recurrent appearance of the color blue.

Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
Output: green yellow red red blue blue

Once more, ""bluf"" generates a ""red blue"" pattern, although in this case, there is an extra blue because of the word ""lug"" that follows ""bluf.""

By analyzing the outputs, it seems that ""bluf"" is consistently associated with the ""blue"" and sometimes with ""red"" as well. Looking at the positioning, ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue"" in outputs where ""lug"" appears after ""bluf."" Where ""lug"" does not follow ""bluf,"" the ""blue"" is absent or is replaced by ""red."" Based on these observations, ""bluf"" could be understood to trigger an output of ""blue,"" but its exact meaning seems tied to the context in which it appears, especially related to the word following it (in these cases, whether ""lug"" is present or not).

Rule: ""bluf"" means blue, with an additional influence or modification based on the word that follows it. If ""lug"" follows ""bluf,"" it reinforces the blue color in the output; otherwise, ""bluf"" might also relate to the color red in the output.",0.7,7,bluf
Rule: walm -> repeat the last color mentioned two additional times.,1.0,7,walm
"The rule for the word walm seems to be the following:

When walm appears after a color word, it repeats the output of that color word that many times plus one additional instance. 

To validate this rule, let's apply it to each example:

1. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   - 'lug' produces one instance of 'blue'
   - 'walm' then repeats the previous color an additional two times (since one instance of 'blue' was already produced by 'lug')
   - 'wif' produces two instances of 'red'
   Output: blue blue blue red red

2. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   - 'wif' produces one instance of 'red'
   - 'bluf' produces one instance of 'red'
   - 'dax' produces two instances of 'green'
   - 'walm' then repeats the previous color one more time (since two instances of 'green' were already produced by 'dax')
   Output: red red green green green

3. Input: wif walm dax
   - 'wif' produces two instances of 'red'
   - 'walm' repeats the previous color one additional time (since two instances of 'red' were already produced by 'wif')
   - 'dax' produces one instance of 'green'
   Output: red red red green

4. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   - 'zup' produces one instance of 'yellow'
   - 'dax' produces one instance of 'green'
   - 'lug' then produces one instance of 'blue'
   - 'walm' then repeats the previous color two more times (since one instance of 'blue' was already produced by 'lug')
   - Another 'zup' produces one instance of 'yellow'
   - 'lug' again produces one instance of 'blue'
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

5. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   - 'dax' produces two instances of 'green'
   - 'walm' repeats the previous color one more time (since two instances of 'green' were already produced by 'dax')
   - 'wif' produces two instances of 'red'
   - 'bluf' does not exist in this input, it seems to be a mistake in the question, assuming 'bluf' produces 'red', it would produce one more instance of 'red'
   Output: green green green red red

Rule: walm -> It repeats the output color that immediately precedes it that many times plus one. For example, if the previous color was output once, walm will result in that color being output two more times, for a total of three instances. If the previous color output was twice, walm will result in that color being output three times, and so on.",1.0,7,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for a pattern in the inputs and outputs:

1. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red
2. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
3. wif walm dax -> red red red green
4. zup dax lug walm zup lug -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
5. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red

If we look at the positions of ""walm"" in the inputs and the corresponding outputs:

1. ""lug walm"" -> blue blue blue
2. ""dax walm"" -> green green green
3. ""wif walm"" -> red red red
4. ""lug walm"" -> blue blue blue
5. ""dax walm"" -> green green green

From the above, we can see that when walm follows ""lug"" (blue), ""dax"" (green), or ""wif"" (red), it seems to repeat the color associated with the preceding word. It's effectively a signal to repeat the previous color mentioned specific times.

For instances where ""walm"" is not followed by another color and stands as last in the sequence (1st and 2nd examples), it is followed by a color not associated with any word so far, which is red.

Based on the available data, we can deduce the following rule for the meaning of ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the word before walm three times. If ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, append red twice.",0.8,7,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeat the color before walm one additional time than already has been repeated in the sequence. 

For example in the first input ""lug walm wif bluf"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue and is repeated once, then ""walm"" signifies that blue should be repeated one more time before moving on to the next color which is red for ""wif bluf"".",0.8,7,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine each input alongside its corresponding output and look for patterns:

1. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red
   - lug corresponds to blue
   - wif corresponds to red
   - bluf corresponds to red

2. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   - wif corresponds to red
   - bluf corresponds to red
   - dax corresponds to green

3. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   - wif corresponds to red
   - dax corresponds to green

4. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   - zup corresponds to yellow
   - dax corresponds to green
   - lug corresponds to blue

5. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   - dax corresponds to green
   - wif corresponds to red
   - bluf corresponds to red

Looking at the patterns, when ""walm"" is present in the input, the output color before it appears is repeated additional times as follows:

- In the first example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times in the output.
- In the second example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and ""green"" is repeated three times in the output.
- In the third example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and ""red"" is repeated three times in the output.
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times AFTER it first occurred.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and ""green"" is repeated three times in the output.

From these examples, it seems that when ""walm"" appears in the input, it indicates that the color word immediately preceding it should be repeated three times (instead of once) in the output.

"Rule: dax -> green

In every example provided, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in the output. There seems to be no variance in the association regardless of the words that precede or follow ""dax."" Therefore, we can conclude that ""dax"" means green.",1.0,8,dax
"To begin deducing the rule, let's first line up the inputs with their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   - ""dax"" appears twice and both times it is followed by ""green"".
   - ""walm"" appears twice, and each of these instances is followed by three ""green"".
   - ""wif"" appears once and is followed by ""red"".
   - ""lug"" appears once and is followed by ""blue"".

2. Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
   Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
   - ""dax"" appears twice and again, both times it is followed by ""green"".
   - ""bluf"" appears twice and each instance is followed by ""blue"".
   - ""lug"" appears once and it is followed by ""blue"".
   - ""zup"" appears at the beginning and the end of the input, and is represented as ""yellow"" at both the beginning and the end of the output.

3. Input: dax
   Output: green
   - ""dax"" stands alone in this example and corresponds to ""green"".

4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" and ""walm"" yet again leads to two more ""green"".

5. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red
   - ""dax"" is immediately followed by ""green"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

The evidence suggests that ""dax"" is consistently represented by the color ""green"" regardless of the context in which it appears. Other words influence the number of colors after them or the specific colors, such as ""walm"" which is followed by three ""green"" colors and ""wif"" which is followed by ""red"". However, ""dax"" remains constant throughout as ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,8,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the term ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Every time ""dax"" appears in an input, ""green"" appears in the output. Additionally, the word after ""dax"" seems to produce a different color: ""walm"" leads to additional greens, while ""wif"" leads to red and ""lug"" leads to blue.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" is:

Rule: dax -> green

When ""dax"" appears in the input, the output will include ""green"". Follow-up words may produce a sequence of greens, a red, or a blue depending on what those words are.",1.0,8,dax
"With the given examples, the word ""dax"" seems to consistently translate to green in the outputs. Here's how it breaks down:

- Whenever ""dax"" is mentioned, the output is ""green"" or starts with ""green"".
- The sequence ""wif lug dax walm"" translates to ""red blue green green"".
- The sequence ""lug bluf dax"" translates to ""blue blue green"".
- ""Dax"" by itself translates to ""green"".
- ""Dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"".
- ""Dax wif"" translates to ""green red"".

Despite the other words around ""dax"" changing the output in a less obvious pattern, ""dax"" yields ""green"" consistently regardless of its position.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,8,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""dax"" seems to correspond with a specific output color whenever it appears in the input. Here is the breakdown of what ""dax"" corresponds to in the output:

1. When ""dax"" appears alone:
   - Input: dax
   - Output: green
   
   This implies that the standalone ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

2. When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"":
   - Input: dax walm
   - Output: green green green
   
   This suggests that the combination of ""dax walm"" results in three occurrences of ""green"".

3. When ""dax"" is followed by ""wif"":
   - Input: dax wif
   - Output: green red
   
   This implies that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

4. When ""dax"" is surrounded by other words:
   - Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   - Output: green green green red blue green green green
   
   Observing the repeated pattern, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"", ""walm"" gives additional ""greens"", and when ""dax"" is not followed by ""walm"", it still outputs ""green"" for itself.

5. When ""dax"" precedes ""lug"":
   - Input: dax lug bluf dax zup
   - Output: green blue blue green yellow
   
   Here, ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"".

To summarize, ""dax"" seems to consistently map to the color ""green"" irrespective of its position, with additional patterns noted based on the following word. 

Rule: dax -> green

In contexts where additional rules are not explicitly stated or inferred, ""dax"" can be interpreted as the color ""green"".",0.9,8,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's examine the contextual patterns where it appears. We'll see how the position of ""wif"" relates to the output colors:

1. dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   Here, ""wif"" is followed by ""red red red"".
   
2. dax lug wif
   Output: green blue red
   Here, ""wif"" is at the end and yields ""red"".
   
3. lug dax wif lug
   Output: blue green red blue
   Here, ""wif"" is followed by ""red"".
   
4. wif dax lug dax
   Output: red green blue green
   Here, ""wif"" is at the beginning and yields ""red"".
   
5. zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   Here, ""wif"" is at the end and yields ""red"".

Based on these examples, whenever ""wif"" appears, regardless of its position, the output color is ""red"". There is no pattern indicating that the meaning changes with position or context within the given data set. 

Therefore, the rule can be formulated as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,8,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze each input and its corresponding output individually:

1. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" ""Wif"" corresponds to the first ""red"" in the sequence.

2. Input: dax lug wif
   Output: green blue red
   
   Following the pattern from previous inputs, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" ""Wif"" is associated with ""red.""

3. Input: lug dax wif lug
   Output: blue green red blue
   
   ""Lug"" is ""blue,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and the ""wif"" in this context corresponds to ""red.""

4. Input: wif dax lug dax
   Output: red green blue green
   
   We see that ""wif"" leads to ""red"" at the beginning of the sequence and the other words follow the already established pattern.

5. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   
   ""Zup"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

From these examples, it seems clear that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,8,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the patterns it is associated with in relation to the colors provided in the outputs.

- dax wif walm lug zup walm: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
- dax lug wif: green blue red
- lug dax wif lug: blue green red blue
- wif dax lug dax: red green blue green
- zup walm wif: yellow yellow yellow red

From these examples, ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""lug"" to blue, and ""walm"" and ""zup"" to yellow in different instances.

Now looking specifically at the inputs and outputs containing ""wif"":

- ""dax wif walm"" corresponds to ""green red red""
- ""wif dax"" corresponds to ""red green""
- In the single instance input of ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""

In all the examples, ""wif"" precedes a word that in itself would correspond to a color in the output. However, every time ""wif"" appears, ""red"" appears in the output, even when ""wif"" is the first word. Considering this, it seems ""wif"" directly corresponds to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,8,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's first look for patterns surrounding the times ""wif"" appears in the examples:

1. dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""dax"" is followed by ""wif"" to give ""green red""
   - ""walm"" (yellow) and ""lug"" (blue) follow ""wif"" and turn red.

2. dax lug wif -> green blue red
   - ""wif"" is the last word and corresponds to red.

3. lug dax wif lug -> blue green red blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red when preceded by ""dax"" (green) and followed by ""lug"" (blue).

4. wif dax lug dax -> red green blue green
   - ""wif"" comes before ""dax"" (green) and the outcome is red.

5. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red
   - ""wif"" is at the end, following ""zup"" (yellow) and ""walm"" (yellow), resulting in red.

Based on these examples, it seems that ""wif"" consistently results in the color red, regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it. Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""wif"" translates to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,8,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can try to determine any patterns or rules that describe what ""wif"" corresponds to in the output. Here are the observations:

1. In each example, ""wif"" consistently translates to the output ""red.""
2. ""wif"" does not seem to cause changes to the colors assigned to the words around it.
3. Regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input sequence, it always results in ""red.""

From this, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,8,wif
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,8,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can infer the following:

""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""

Additionally, other nonce words and their meanings can be deduced from the context:

""wif"" translates to ""red,"" as seen in the examples where it's not preceded or followed by another word, and ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" as shown in the example where it alternates with ""zup.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color:

zup -> yellow
wif -> red

"Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" appears to correspond to the color yellow each time it is mentioned. The context in which ""zup"" is used doesn't seem to change its meaning. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" means ""yellow.""",1.0,8,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" This is consistent across all examples provided.",1.0,8,zup
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the term ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it. To illustrate:

- ""zup bluf"" resulted in ""yellow yellow,"" which indicates that the word ""bluf"" took on the color associated with ""zup.""
- ""dax bluf"" produced ""green green,"" showing that ""bluf"" adopted the color associated with ""dax.""
- In ""wif bluf dax lug,"" ""bluf"" followed ""wif"" and the output was ""red red,"" further confirming that ""bluf"" is taking the color of the preceding word.
- The sequence ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" gave ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red,"" which reinforces the pattern, as ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and then ""zup,"" taking on their associated colors respectively.

Therefore, the rule for what ""bluf"" means in this context is:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.",1.0,8,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word. 

For example:
In ""zup bluf,"" zup corresponds to ""yellow,"" so bluf repeats this color, leading to ""yellow yellow."" 
In ""dax bluf,"" dax is associated with ""green,"" so bluf repeats ""green,"" resulting in ""green green.""",1.0,8,bluf

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" follows another word, the output is a repetition of the color that corresponds to the preceding word.",1.0,8,bluf
"Rule: ""bluf"" -> The word ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word that precedes it.

Explanation:

- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""yellow yellow"".
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""green green"".
- In the sentence ""wif bluf dax lug"", ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", resulting in ""red red"", then ""dax"" follows with ""green"", and ""lug"" seems to correlate to ""blue"".
- In the sentence ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"", ""zup"" gives ""yellow"", ""lug"" gives ""blue"", followed by ""bluf"" which copies the color of ""zup"", resulting in ""yellow"", then another ""zup bluf"" giving ""yellow yellow"", and finally ""wif"" gives ""red"".
- The example ""zup bluf"" given twice both times resulted in ""yellow yellow,"" reinforcing that ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word.

Therefore, it seems that the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" is to mirror the color output of the preceding word, regardless of what that word is.",1.0,8,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. Here are the observations:

- In the first example, the word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" following it results in another ""yellow.""
- In the second example, the word ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" following it results in another ""green.""
- The third example gives us ""wif"" as ""red,"" and ""bluf"" right after ""dax,"" which previously translated to ""green,"" gives us another ""green.""
- The fourth example again shows ""zup"" turning into ""yellow,"" followed by ""bluf,"" which again repeats the ""yellow"" color.

From these patterns, we deduce the rule for ""bluf"": 

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.",1.0,8,bluf
"walm -> meaning. Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" causes the following word to be repeated three times, with its corresponding color translated from the given word to color mapping. For example, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" thus ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow."" Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" within these examples appears to be repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it, three times.

Rule: Walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,8,walm
"walm -> repeating the color associated with the word preceding it three times.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, the color associated with that preceding word is repeated three times.

"walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the previous word.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, it indicates that the color associated with the preceding word should be repeated three times. 
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"" (repeating ""yellow"" which corresponds to ""zup"")
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" (repeating ""green"" which corresponds to ""dax"")
- ""wif walm"" gives ""red red red"" (repeating ""red"" which corresponds to ""wif"")",1.0,8,walm
"walm -> repetition of the previous color. Rule: Repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""walm"" three times.",1.0,8,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to correspond with the repetition of the color that follows the first word in the input. The color repeated three times appears to be linked to the word preceding ""walm"":

- ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green"".
- ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red"".

In the examples where there are words following ""walm"", the colors that correspond to those words are presented after the three repeated colors. This pattern is consistent across all examples provided.

Therefore, the rule seems to be as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

- ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow.
- ""dax"" is associated with the color green.
- ""wif"" is associated with the color red.

Rule: dax -> green,1.0,9,dax
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,9,wif
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" leads to the output ""red."" Additionally, we can observe that other words correspond to specific colors as well:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when it is before ""wif"" and ""blue"" when it is after ""wif""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" when it is before ""wif"" and ""blue"" when it is after ""wif""

Looking closely, ""bluf"" and ""lug"" seem to change their outputs based on their position relative to ""wif."" However, since ""bluf"" is always ""blue"" after ""wif,"" and ""lug"" is always ""blue"" as well, regardless of its position with ""wif,"" we can determine that ""wif"" itself does not change the color outcome for ""lug.""

Based on these observations, we can establish the following rule:

wif -> red

Given the word ""wif,"" the output should always include the color ""red.""",1.0,9,wif
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's examine the input and output pairs to look for patterns.

Input: zup wif → Output: yellow red
Input: zup bluf wif walm → Output: yellow yellow red red red
Input: wif lug zup bluf → Output: red blue yellow yellow
Input: lug wif lug bluf → Output: blue red blue blue
Input: wif bluf lug zup → Output: red red blue yellow

Examining the first input-output pair:

- ""zup"" seems to produce ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" seems to produce ""red.""

Looking at the second input-output pair:

- ""zup"" produces ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" produces ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" seems to produce ""red.""
- ""walm"" is unknown but consistently produces two ""red"" outputs.

From the third input-output pair:

- ""wif"" produces ""red.""
- ""lug"" produces ""blue.""
- ""zup"" produces ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" produces ""yellow.""

From the fourth input-output pair:

- ""lug"" produces ""blue.""
- ""wif"" produces ""red.""
- ""lug"" (repeated) still produces ""blue.""
- ""bluf"" produces ""blue"" (unlike previous instances).

From the fifth input-output pair:

- ""wif"" produces ""red.""
- ""bluf"" produces ""red"" (different from previous instances).
- ""lug"" produces ""blue.""
- ""zup"" produces ""yellow.""

From our observations, ""zup"" consistently produces ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" consistently produces ""blue."" However, ""bluf"" is inconsistent, producing ""yellow"" twice and ""blue"" or ""red"" in other cases. ""walm"" only appears once, producing two ""red"" outputs, but doesn't give us enough data to establish a pattern for it.

The word ""wif,"" however, consistently translates to ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,9,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's examine the patterns related to its position and corresponding output:

1. When ""wif"" appears after ""zup,"" the output is ""red."" In ""zup wif,"" we get ""yellow red,"" and in ""zup bluf wif,"" we get ""yellow yellow red."" In the last example, ""zup"" is not directly before ""wif,"" yet ""zup"" is still followed by ""yellow."" 

2. In the examples where ""wif"" is not preceded by ""zup,"" the output preceding ""red"" is not ""yellow,"" suggesting that ""wif"" does not directly translate to ""red,"" but the combination of ""zup"" and ""wif"" results in ""yellow red.""

3. ""Wif"" correlates with ""red"" when it appears after ""zup,"" but otherwise, ""wif"" correlates simply with ""red"" as shown in examples ""wif lug zup bluf"" and ""wif bluf lug zup.""

Combining these observations, the rule appears to be that ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" but it may affect preceding words when combined in a sequence, particularly with ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow.""

Rule: wif -> red.",0.8,9,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's examine the relationship between the inputs and outputs. It appears that each word is directly translated to a color.

From the examples:
- When ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" appears, the output is ""red.""
- When ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue.""
- ""Wif"" is associated with the color ""red.""

Now, looking at the outputs where ""wif"" appears several times, such as in the second and third examples, there seems to be a repeating pattern:
- ""wif"" repeated once translates to one ""red.""
- ""wif"" repeated twice leads to two subsequent ""red.""

However, in the fourth example, ""wif"" appears once but yields two different colors: ""red"" and ""blue."" This happens due to the presence of ""lug"" after ""wif,"" which is associated with ""blue."" It indicates that ""wif"" does not always directly convert into a singular ""red"" and could be influenced by its position or neighboring words.

Let's refine our understanding with a revised examination:
- ""wif"" before ""lug"" results in ""red blue"" (fourth example).
- ""wif"" before ""bluf"" results in ""red red"" (second and fifth examples).
- ""wif"" after ""lug"" results in ""blue red"" (third example).
- ""wif"" alone is ""red"" (first example).

With the provided data, the clearest pattern is that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" and seems to influence or be influenced by the word immediately following or preceding it. However, the dataset is limited, and without further examples, a more comprehensive rule including how it interacts with subsequent words is difficult to define.

Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be:
Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" with the output possibly influenced by the directly adjacent word, leading to a pattern based on sequence and proximity within the given string of words.",0.8,9,wif
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position or context within the given examples.",1.0,9,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

"zup -> yellow

Rule: Regardless of context, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"".",1.0,9,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look at the relationship between the input and the output in each example. Let's analyze:

1. Input: dax lug bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" at both the beginning and the end.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the middle.
   - ""bluf"" appears where ""blue"" is repeated.

2. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the second position.

3. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" in the second position.

4. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   - This example is the same as the second example and supports the previous observation.

5. Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
   Output: blue red blue green green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" in the fifth position, preceded by ""dax.""

From these examples, ""bluf"" appears to correspond to the color of the adjacent word that comes before it in the sequence. In:

- Example 1, that's ""lug -> blue.""
- Example 2 and 4, that's ""zup -> yellow.""
- Example 3, that's ""dax -> green.""
- Example 5, that's ""dax -> green.""

So the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it represents a repetition of the color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word immediately preceding it.",1.0,9,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes it. Let's analyze the examples:

- Input: dax lug bluf dax -> Output: green blue blue green
  ""bluf"" took the color of ""lug,"" which is blue, and then ""dax"" remains green.

- Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
  ""bluf"" took the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.

- Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green
  ""bluf"" took the color of ""dax,"" which is green.

- Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
  ""bluf"" took the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.

- Input: lug wif lug dax bluf -> Output: blue red blue green green
  ""bluf"" took the color of ""dax,"" which is green.

All the examples show that ""bluf"" replicates the color of the word immediately before it. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" is:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.",1.0,9,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. From examining the examples, ""bluf"" seems to indicate a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before ""bluf"". In all cases, the color that ""bluf"" represents repeats the color of the previous word.

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes it and repeats it.",1.0,9,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" seems to depend on the word that precedes it. Specifically, when ""bluf"" follows a word, it replicates the color that the previous word represents. 

Rule:
- dax = green, so ""dax bluf"" becomes ""green green"".
- zup = yellow, so ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"".
- lug = blue, and ""lug bluf"" isn't provided, but following the pattern, it would likely be ""blue blue"".

Since ""bluf"" merely duplicates the color of the word before it, we can conclude that the rule for ""bluf"" is to repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,9,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the relationship between the input and output in each given example:

Input: dax lug bluf dax 
Output: green blue blue green

Input: zup bluf 
Output: yellow yellow

Input: dax bluf 
Output: green green

Input: zup bluf 
Output: yellow yellow

Input: lug wif lug dax bluf 
Output: blue red blue green green

From the examples, we can observe that:

- The output always consists of colors.
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and in the case of ""dax bluf,"" the output is ""green green,"" where the second green follows the first one directly.
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" similar to the ""dax bluf"" pattern.
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and when it is followed by ""bluf,"" we see ""blue blue"" in the output, as in the first example, but it does not appear to apply in the last example where there is an additional word ""wif"" that corresponds to ""red.""
  
Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" repeats the color word prior to ""bluf."" However, the presence of the word ""wif"" in the last example complicates things a bit, since it does not repeat ""red"" after ""bluf.""

Rule: ""bluf"" -> meaning: ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it, unless interrupted by a different word (as seen in the last example, where ""wif"" appears between ""lug"" and ""bluf,"" causing ""bluf"" to reference the color word before ""wif"" instead).",0.8,9,bluf
"walm -> repeat the prior color

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the examples given. Let's take each input and its corresponding output, compare them, and determine what ""walm"" could signify.

1. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green.
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red.
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and where ""walm"" appears, the color yellow continues until a different word (""wif"") appears.

2. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red.
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the color red continues.

3. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green.
   - After ""dax,"" ""walm"" appears, and the color green continues.

4. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the color blue continues.
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red.
   - ""bluf"" doesn't have a direct preceding example, but by the pattern, it seems it has to correspond to red here.

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the color yellow continues.

From these examples, we can see that ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the preceding word. The rule appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the previous word until a new word with a different associated color appears.

So:

walm -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the previous word until a different color is triggered by another word.",0.9,9,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's initially focus on the color outputs tied to its occurrence:

2. wif walm -> red red red
3. lug zup dax walm -> blue yellow green green green
4. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red
5. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow

Key observations:

- In examples 1, 3, and 5, the word ""walm"" follows a sequence of color names and is associated with repeated instances of the color output that immediately precedes it.
- In examples 2 and 4, despite ""walm"" being used in different sequences, its output is consistent with the color output that precedes it, again in repeated form.

From these observations, the rule appears to be that the word ""walm"" denotes a repetition of the color output that comes before it.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color output.",0.8,9,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to influence the color output to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it. Here's the breakdown:

Input: dax zup walm wif -> Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

Rule: walm -> causes the color output corresponding to the word immediately before it to repeat.",0.8,9,walm
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to correspond to a repeated color in the output sequence. The repeated color is based on the prior word:

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and after ""walm"" we see three yellows which correspond to ""zup"" and one red for ""wif.""
- In the second example, the output is three reds, which correspond to ""wif.""
- In the third example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""dax"" to green, ""zup"" to yellow, and after ""walm,"" we see green repeated.
- In the fourth example, we see blue corresponding to ""lug"" repeated after ""walm,"" followed by red for ""wif.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and after ""walm,"" we see yellow repeated.

The rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the next word's color to be repeated three times, while the final word's color follows this pattern once. The ""walm"" itself adopts the color of the word that is immediately before it.

- In every instance where ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- Regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence, the corresponding output is always ""green.""
- No other input word consistently results in a ""green"" output.

"Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to involve the placement of the nonce word ""dax"" with respect to colors in the output sequence. Here is how we can deduce the rule:

1. In every instance where ""dax"" is present in the input, the output contains the color ""green"" in the corresponding position.
2. The word ""dax"" itself does not seem to change; regardless of its position in the input, it maps to ""green"" in the output.

- Every time ""zup"" appears, a ""yellow"" appears in the output.
- When ""zup"" appears as the second word in the input, the output is ""yellow"" followed by the color(s) corresponding to the following word(s).
- When ""zup"" appears as the first word in the input, the first output color is ""yellow,"" and the rest of the output follows the pattern of colors corresponding to each subsequent word.
- When ""zup"" appears at the end, we see a ""yellow"" at the end of the output.

Given this data, we can infer that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" If we look into context-dependent rules, there is no additional contextual information that changes the meaning of ""zup"" within the examples provided. Therefore, it's safe to deduce the following:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow"". 

This means the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the given context.",1.0,10,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look at each instance and the corresponding output:

1. Input: dax zup bluf 
   Output: green yellow yellow

2. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow

3. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

4. Input: dax bluf wif zup
   Output: green green red yellow

5. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow

It appears that ""zup"" correlates consistently with the color ""yellow"" in the outputs, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, we can conclude that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" in the outputs provided.

Hence, the rule is:
zup -> yellow",1.0,10,zup
"Based on the examples provided, zup appears to correspond to the color yellow. In each instance where zup is used in the input, the word yellow is present in the output. Therefore, one could infer the following rule based on the examples:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,10,zup
"Based on the given examples, each instance of the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output:

Input: dax zup bluf -> Output: green yellow yellow
Input: dax zup bluf -> Output: green yellow yellow
Input: zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red
Input: dax bluf wif zup -> Output: green green red yellow
Input: wif zup -> Output: red yellow

These demonstrate that no matter the position of ""zup"" within the input, it consistently maps to ""yellow."" Therefore, we can deduce:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,10,zup
"Based on the examples given, it appears that 'zup' corresponds to the color yellow. Each time the word 'zup' is present in the input, the word 'yellow' appears in the same position in the output.

"bluf -> repeated color of the preceding word. Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a color-associated word, the output is the color associated with the word prior to ""bluf"" repeated the same number of times as the letters in ""bluf"". 

In each instance, ""bluf"" follows a word that can be associated with a color (""wif"" for red, ""lug"" for blue, ""zup"" for yellow). The word ""bluf"" causes this color to be repeated four times (since ""bluf"" has four letters), as evidenced by the examples given.",1.0,10,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. Meaning is ""red,"" but when following ""zup,"" it changes to ""yellow."" Rule: When preceded by ""zup,"" the meaning of ""bluf"" becomes ""yellow""; otherwise, it means ""red.""",1.0,10,bluf
"Based on the examples given, the word ""bluf"" seems to be associated with the color ""red."" However, additional information is provided by the presence of other words in the sequence. When ""bluf"" is combined with ""wif,"" the output is ""red red."" When ""bluf"" is combined with ""lug,"" the output is ""blue."" When ""bluf"" is combined with both ""wif"" and ""zup,"" we see a pattern of repetition with the corresponding color output for each word (though ""walm"" does not have a clear single color output, it results in a repetition of ""blue blue blue"").

The rule appears to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word placed immediately before it, with a default of ""red"" when it follows ""wif,"" ""blue"" when following ""lug,"" and ""yellow"" when following ""zup."" However, ""walm"" seems to create an exception by repeating the color last mentioned.

Therefore:

- ""bluf"" following ""wif"" -> red
- ""bluf"" following ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""bluf"" following ""lug"" -> blue
- The output of ""bluf"" following other words not included in the examples or without any clear pattern cannot be determined from the given information.

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sentence.",0.0,10,bluf
"From the provided examples, we can observe that the output always consists of a repetition of a color word, and the number of repetitions corresponds to the word that precedes ""walm"". Each of the words appears to have a corresponding color:

- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow

When ""walm"" is used after any of these three words, the output color word is repeated three times. Additionally, when ""wif"" is used after ""walm"", a single ""red"" is added to the output, which seems to add a different color rather than a repetition of one.

Given this information, ""walm"" appears to act as an instruction to repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

Rule: walm indicates that the color associated with the previous word should be said three times.",1.0,10,walm
"Based on the given examples, walm appears to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it, repeating that color three times. Therefore, the rule for walm is:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

Rule: If 'x' is the color associated with the word before walm, then walm translates to 'x x x'.",1.0,10,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" is associated with a repetition of the color that precedes it. Here's the breakdown:

1. Input: lug walm -> blue blue blue
   ""lug"" seems to correspond to the color blue, and ""walm"" causes it to be repeated three times.

2. Input: dax walm wif -> green green green red
   ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""walm"" causes its repetition, and ""wif"" maps to red.

3. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax ->
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   Here, we see ""lug"" followed by ""walm"" making blue repeat three times, and ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" would likely have the same pattern for green, but it's interrupted by ""wif"" and ""bluf"" leading to red and red again, then a single ""dax"" reprising green once.

4. Input: dax walm wif walm zup ->
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" leads to three greens, ""wif"" is red, and then ""walm"" makes the red repeat, finally ""zup"" results in yellow.

5. Input: zup walm wif ->
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   ""zup"" correlates with yellow followed by ""walm"", causing it to repeat, and ""wif"" is red once more.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.",1.0,10,walm
"walm -> the color repeated thrice corresponding to the word that precedes ""walm"". Rule: The word ""walm"" indicates that the preceding color word should be repeated three times. For example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and thus ""walm"" means to repeat ""blue"" three times.",1.0,10,walm
"Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" appears to affect the color word produced in the Output. Each occurrence of ""walm"" is followed by repeating the same color word, with the specific color contingent upon the preceding word. The number of repetitions also corresponds to the position of ""walm"" in the sequence.

From the examples, we can deduce the following:
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue""; ""lug"" seems to influence the color blue, and since ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it repeats the word ""blue"" three times (since ""lug"" is the first word and ""walm"" is the second). 
- ""dax walm wif"" produces ""green green green red""; again, ""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green,"" and ""walm"" causes the word ""green"" to be repeated three times (due to ""walm"" being the second word and ""dax"" being the first). ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
- When ""walm"" is used twice, as in ""dax walm wif walm zup,"" the pattern of repetition occurs twice as well.

Thus, it seems that ""walm"" causes the preceding color to be repeated as many times as its position in the sequence. If ""walm"" is the second word, the previous color word is repeated twice, and if ""walm"" is the third word, it's repeated three times, and so on.

Given this, the rule seems to be:

"Based on the examples given, we can induce the following rule:

Whenever ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red"". There is no instance where ""wif"" corresponds to a different color in the output.

"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rule for the word ""wif"":

- Whenever ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red"".
- The presence of ""wif"" is not dependent on the position in the input sequence; it always results in the output ""red"" regardless of where it appears.

From this, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,11,wif
"Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

zup -> yellow.",1.0,11,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let us examine the patterns of the input and corresponding output colors:

1. Input: dax zup bluf → Output: green yellow yellow
2. Input: zup dax zup lug → Output: yellow green yellow blue
3. Input: zup lug zup dax → Output: yellow blue yellow green
4. Input: dax wif zup dax → Output: green red yellow green
5. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif → Output: yellow blue red green green red

We will look for patterns where ""zup"" appears and see what color follows in the output to determine its meaning. Let's analyze the positions where ""zup"" appears and the corresponding colors:

- When ""zup"" is the second word (as in ""dax zup""), the output color is yellow.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""dax"" (as in ""zup dax""), the output color is green.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""lug"" (as in ""zup lug""), the output color is blue.
- When ""zup"" appears twice in a row (as in ""zup zup""), the output color is yellow for both.
- When ""zup"" follows ""wif"" (as in ""wif zup""), the output is yellow.

The consistent aspect across all the examples is that independently of the position, every instance of ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. There does not seem to be a positional or contextual variation affecting the color associated with ""zup"". Even when ""zup"" comes before different words or is surrounded by a variety of other words, the output color linked to ""zup"" remains the same.

It is therefore reasonable to deduce that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,11,zup
"Analyzing the given examples, it becomes clear that 'zup' does not correspond to a single color. Instead, its output color varies between occurrences. The output color seems to depend on the context, specifically, the word that comes after 'zup'.

Let's break down the examples:

1. ""dax zup bluf"" leads to ""green yellow yellow"". Here, 'dax' translates to 'green', and 'bluf' to 'yellow'. 'Zup' is followed by 'bluf' and hence translates to 'yellow'.

2. ""zup dax zup lug"" leads to ""yellow green yellow blue"". The first 'zup' is followed by 'dax' (green), the second 'zup' by 'lug' (blue). Each instance of 'zup' takes its color from the word that follows it.

3. ""zup lug zup dax"" leads to ""yellow blue yellow green"". Again, each 'zup' adopts the color of the word following it.

4. ""dax wif zup dax"" leads to ""green red yellow green"". 'Wif' translates to 'red', and the 'zup' here is followed by 'dax' (green). As before, 'zup' takes the color of the following word.

5. ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" leads to ""yellow blue red green green red"". In this longer sequence, the rule still applies: 'zup' precedes 'lug' (blue) and follows suit with the color.

Based on these observations, the rule for 'zup' seems to be:

Rule: 'zup' takes on the color of the word that follows it in the sequence.

Therefore:

zup -> The color of the word that follows 'zup'.",1.0,11,zup
"From the provided examples, it is evident that each word corresponds to a color. The word ""zup"" appears to consistently correspond to the color ""yellow."" The other words seem to have their own color associations as follows:

- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

It is important to note that there appears to be an error in the examples: ""bluf"" should correspond to one color consistently, but it is shown as both ""yellow"" and ""green"" in the examples provided. Assuming this is a mistake, based on the pattern of unique colors for other words, ""bluf"" would likely correspond to the color ""green.""

Given this, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",0.8,11,zup
"Rule: Each word corresponds to a specific color. ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""bluf"" to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

Therefore, zup -> yellow.",0.8,11,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. 

Here's the breakdown of each example to support this conclusion:

- Input: zup bluf
  Output: yellow yellow
  (The color associated with ""zup"" is yellow, and ""bluf"" repeats this color.)

- Input: wif dax bluf
  Output: red green green
  (The color for ""dax"" is green, and ""bluf"" repeats this color.)

- Input: wif bluf
  Output: red red
  (The color for ""wif"" is red, and ""bluf"" repeats this color.)

- Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax

- Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
  Output: green red green yellow yellow

Based on this analysis, the rule appears to be:

Example breakdown:

- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"" because the color for ""zup"" is yellow, and ""bluf"" repeats it.
- ""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green"" because ""dax"" is associated with green, and ""bluf"" repeats the green color.
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"" because ""wif"" is associated with red and ""bluf"" repeats it.
- ""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax"" -> ""red blue blue yellow yellow green"" because ""lug"" is blue, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""bluf"" repeats both colors respectively.
- ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" -> ""green red green yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" is yellow, and ""bluf"" repeats the yellow color after it.",1.0,11,bluf
"Rule: 

The nonce word bluf appears to correspond to the immediate prior word's color repetition. That is, when bluf follows a word, the output is the color that word represents, repeated twice.

- ""zup"" represents the color yellow, so ""zup bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow"".
- ""wif"" represents the color red, so ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red"".
- ""dax"" represents the color green, so ""dax bluf"" outputs ""green green"".

Thus, the rule for bluf seems to be: Repeat the color of the previous word two times.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.,1.0,11,bluf
"Observing the outputs corresponding to the occurrences of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we can infer the following pattern:

- When ""bluf"" immediately follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" is at the end of the input sequence, except after ""zup,"" it is repeated in color form as the previous color. For example: ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"" and ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green.""
- When ""bluf"" is in a mixed sequence (like ""lug bluf zup bluf"" or ""wif dax zup bluf""), it takes the color of the word immediately preceding it (like ""lug"" -> ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" becomes ""blue"" and ""zup"" -> ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" becomes ""yellow"").

Thus, the rule seems to be: 

bluf -> meaning. When ""bluf"" follows another word, it takes on the color of that word repeated twice. If ""bluf"" specifically follows ""zup,"" it always translates to ""yellow yellow,"" which seems to be an exception to the general rule.

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it three times. To deduce the rule, we can look at the color pattern output for each instance where ""walm"" is used:

2. In ""lug walm wif bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue blue red red."" Since ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is three blues, ""lug"" must correspond to blue and ""wif"" likely corresponds to red, repeating twice after ""walm.""

Based on this information, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,12,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we have to cross-reference the inputs with their designated outputs to detect a pattern.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,12,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""dax,"" we should look for patterns associated with this word across the different examples. Let's analyze the inputs and corresponding outputs one by one:

Input: zup dax lug
Output: yellow green blue
- Here again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Input: dax lug wif
Output: green blue red
- ""dax"" is the first element and once more corresponds to ""green.""

Input: wif dax lug dax
Output: red green blue green
- In this sequence, ""dax"" appears twice, corresponding to both instances of ""green.""

Input: lug wif dax
Output: blue red green
- ""dax"" is the last element and corresponds to ""green"" again.

Given that in every example, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, we can deduce the following:

dax -> meaning. Rule: ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sentence.",1.0,12,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" There are no instances where ""wif"" translates into a color other than ""red,"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence. Hence, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,12,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that each nonce word (lug, zup, wif, bluf, dax, walm) corresponds to a specific color. Here's what we can infer from the examples:

- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- bluf -> red
- dax -> green
- walm -> no direct correspondence provided, but walm followed by dax zup zup results in yellow yellow green yellow, suggesting that walm itself may not alter the color sequence or it could mean 'repeat previous color' since the output after dax did not introduce a new color in the first appearance.

Now, reviewing the examples with this hypothesis:

- Input: lug zup wif -> Output: blue yellow red (consistent)
- Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> Output: red red yellow red blue green (consistent)
- Input: wif zup -> Output: red yellow (consistent)
- Input: wif zup walm dax zup -> Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow (consistent, assuming walm has no effect or means repeat previous color)

Example 2: ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax"" translates to ""red red yellow red blue green"". ""wif"" appears twice and is aligned with ""red"" in both instances.
Example 3: ""wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow"". Here, ""wif"" directly corresponds to ""red"".
Example 4: ""wif zup walm dax zup"" translates to ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow"". ""wif"" is the first word and translates to the first color, ""red"".
Example 5: ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red"". ""wif"" occurs after ""dax"" and corresponds to ""red"".

In all instances, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"".

"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" results in the output repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here's how this pattern emerges from the examples:

1. wif dax zup bluf -> red green yellow yellow

Whenever ""bluf"" follows another word, the output color is a repetition of the color associated with that preceding word. For instance, when ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red"") is followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""red red"".

Rule: bluf -> repetition of the color of the word that precedes it.",1.0,12,bluf

- ""wif dax zup bluf"": The color before ""bluf"" is yellow (associated with ""zup""), and ""bluf"" outputs a second yellow.
- ""zup bluf lug"": Again, ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and ""bluf"" duplicates the yellow that follows it.
- ""wif bluf dax walm"": Here ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which is associated with red, so ""bluf"" outputs a second red.
- ""dax bluf"": The word ""dax"" is associated with green, ""bluf"" replicates this color.
- ""wif bluf"": Red is associated with ""wif"", and ""bluf"" produces another red.

Therefore, the rule governing the meaning of ""bluf"" is that it causes a repetition of the color linked to the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.",1.0,12,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" outputs a color repeated three times. The specific color generated by ""walm"" appears to correspond to the color that precedes it. Here's the breakdown of the pattern:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which outputs ""yellow."" Therefore ""walm"" causes ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows the second ""zup,"" which outputs ""yellow."" Consequently, ""walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which outputs ""blue."" Consequently, ""walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which outputs ""green."" Consequently, ""walm"" results in ""green green green.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" directly follows ""dax,"" which outputs ""green,"" so ""walm"" translates to ""green green green.""

Walm -> meaning: Walm outputs the color that precedes it, repeated three times.

Rule: If a color word precedes ""walm,"" the output of ""walm"" will be that color repeated three times.",1.0,12,walm

Each color is associated with a different word (""zup"" for yellow, ""lug"" for blue, ""dax"" for green, and ""wif"" for red), and ""walm"" seems to take on that color and repeats it three times in the output.

- If the previous word is ""dax,"" walm means ""green green green.""
- If the previous word is ""wif,"" walm means ""red red red"" (as inferred from the pattern seen with wif bluf and the output red red).

Thus, walm repeats the color of the word before it three times.",1.0,12,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it's possible to deduce that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word that precedes ""walm"". Here's the breakdown:

- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"": ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" causes it to be repeated three times.
- ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"": Each color is uttered once, except for ""zup"", which precedes ""walm"" making ""yellow"" to be repeated three times after the sequence.
- ""lug walm dax"" -> ""blue blue blue green"": ""lug"" is blue and is followed by ""walm,"" which results in ""blue"" being said three times. ""dax"" then is green.
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green"": Here, ""dax"" is before ""walm"" so ""green"" is repeated three times.
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"": Similarly, ""dax"" proceeds ""walm"" and ""green"" is repeated three times.

Based on this pattern, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning. ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it three times. If that word is ""zup,"" the output is yellow three times; if it's ""lug,"" it's blue three times; if it's ""dax,"" it's green three times; and if it's ""wif,"" it's red, which we haven't seen right before ""walm"" but could assume would follow the pattern similarly.",1.0,12,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" translates to the repetition of the color word that comes immediately before it, three times. Here are the observations supporting this:

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (which is translated as ""yellow""), the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In the second input where ""walm"" also follows ""zup"", the output is again three repetitions of ""yellow"".
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (which translates to ""blue""), the output is ""blue blue blue"".
- In the case where ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (translated as ""green""), whether it is immediately after (""dax walm"") or with another word in between (""wif bluf dax walm""), the output is ""green green green"".

So, ""walm"" is a rule that means repeat the previous color word three times.

"Rule: 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow'. The output color following 'zup' seems to depend on the word following it. If the word is 'dax', then 'zup' is followed by 'green'.

Hence, we can conclude that 'zup' indicates the color 'yellow'. 

zup -> yellow",1.0,13,zup
"Based on the examples given, the word ""zup"" seems to consistently correspond to the color ""yellow."" It does not change based on its position in the sequence or the other words present. Therefore:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,13,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""zup,"" we'll need to look for patterns across the examples given. Let's examine each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: zup dax bluf | Output: yellow green green
2. Input: zup dax | Output: yellow green
3. Input: zup bluf | Output: yellow yellow
4. Input: lug zup bluf dax | Output: blue yellow yellow green
5. Input: zup dax | Output: yellow green

From these examples, we can identify the following:

- Whenever ""zup"" appears, the first color in the output is ""yellow.""
- The presence of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" provided that it follows ""zup."" This is consistent in examples 1, 2, and 5.
- ""Bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" when it follows ""zup dax"" (as seen in example 1) but turns to ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup"" alone (as seen in example 3).
- ""Lug"" by itself translates to ""blue,"" as shown in example 4.

From these observations, we can infer that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" as it consistently results in the color ""yellow"" being the first part of the output whenever it appears.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,13,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"", we can look for patterns in the examples provided:

1. When ""zup"" is followed by ""dax"", the output starts with ""yellow green"".
2. When ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"", the output starts with ""yellow yellow"".
3. When ""zup"" stands alone before ""dax"", the output is consistently ""yellow green"".
4. When another word (""lug"") precedes ""zup bluf dax"", the output includes ""yellow"" after ""blue"", and before ""yellow green"".

Considering these observations, it seems that the output color sequence does not depend on the position of ""zup"" in the sentence but rather on the word that follows it. Given that ""zup"" is consistently associated with the output color ""yellow"" regardless of what comes after, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow

Thus, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in the output sequence.",0.9,13,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that the word preceding it represents. Here is the pattern:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output. ""Bluf"" also follows ""dax,"" and the word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and ""dax"" is ""green"" in the output.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and the output for ""lug"" is ""blue.""
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and ""zup"" respectively, and the output is ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""yellow"" for ""zup.""

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> Takes the color of the preceding word.",1.0,13,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the correlation between the input and the output:

2. After ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""
3. After ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""
4. After ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""

Given these associations, we can see:

- ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow.""
- ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green.""
- ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue.""
- There is no direct example for ""wif bluf,"" but based on the pattern, it would likely result in ""red red.""

Thus, we can induce that ""bluf"" serves as a function that repeats the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word.",1.0,13,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color indicated by the preceding word. To elaborate:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and the output for ""lug"" is ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" also outputs ""blue"" right after ""lug.""
- In the second example, although ""bluf"" does not follow ""dax"" directly because of ""wif"" in between, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""bluf"" outputs ""green"" as well after ""dax.""
- The third example reiterates the previous rule; ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""bluf"" also is ""blue"" right after ""lug.""
- The fourth and fifth examples both show ""bluf"" following ""dax"" and ""zup,"" respectively, each time matching the output color of the preceding word: ""green"" after ""dax"" and ""yellow"" after ""zup.""

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is normally ""red,"" except when ""bluf"" follows, the output is ""blue.""

It seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it repeats the color associated with the word that comes directly before it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word.",1.0,13,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the relationship between the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

- In the first example, whenever we see ""bluf,"" it is followed by ""dax"" and the color sequence is ""blue green."" However, when ""dax"" is not preceded by ""bluf,"" the color is just ""green.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is at the end after a ""dax,"" and the color is ""green,"" just like ""dax"" on its own.
- The third example shows ""bluf"" after ""lug"" and the color changes from ""blue"" to ""blue"" again.
- The fourth example consists of only ""dax"" and ""bluf,"" both leading to ""green.""
- The last example includes just ""zup"" and ""bluf,"" and they both correspond to ""yellow.""

The rule seems to be that ""bluf"" on its own translates to ""yellow"" when following ""zup,"" and ""green"" when following ""dax."" When ""bluf"" comes after ""lug,"" it doesn't change the color which remains ""blue.""

However, the instructions call for one comprehensive rule to explain the meaning of ""bluf."" Given that ""bluf"" seems to copy the color of the word that comes directly after it (except when followed by ""dax,"" where it turns ""green"" regardless of what ""dax"" would be on its own), a rule can be proposed:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" changes depending on the context; it typically takes the color of the next word in the series unless it precedes ""dax,"" in which case the color is ""green.""

Therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" can be stated as:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning depends on context: when following ""bluf"" with ""dax,"" it means green; otherwise, it copies the color of the word following it.",0.7,13,bluf
"walm -> repeats the color of the previous word. Rule: When ""walm"" is used after a word, it takes on the color value of the preceding word. If the preceding word does not have an associated color (as in the case of ""walm"" following another ""walm""), it repeats the last color mentioned.

Examples:
- In ""zup walm lug,"" ""zup"" is yellow, so ""walm"" also becomes yellow.
- In ""walm wif walm,"" the first ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which is red, so the first ""walm"" is red, and the second ""walm"" repeats that red color.
- In ""wif dax lug walm,"" the word ""lug"" is blue, and thus the following ""walm"" is also blue.",1.0,13,walm
walm -> Rule: Repeat the color of the preceding word.,1.0,13,walm
"To determine the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""walm,"" let's align the inputs and outputs and analyze the patterns.

1. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

2. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   - Here, ""walm"" when following ""lug"" corresponds to another ""blue,"" and when following ""wif"" corresponds to two additional ""red""

3. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   - ""walm"" in this case adds two more ""red"" to the output

4. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
   - ""walm"" after ""zup"" again corresponds to two additional ""yellow""

5. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   - ""walm"" after ""lug"" adds two more ""blue""

From the analysis above, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it two times. So the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"" for a total of three times (including the color of the word itself).",1.0,13,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be context-dependent, more specifically dependent on the word that immediately precedes it. Following are the observed patterns:

- When ""walm"" follows the word ""zup,"" the output is one instance of ""yellow.""
- When ""walm"" follows the word ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red.""
- When ""walm"" follows the word ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue.""
- When ""walm"" is the second occurrence and follows another ""walm,"" the output is ""red red.""

From these observations, the general rule seems to be:

Rule: The meaning of ""walm"" is determined by the color associated with the preceding word repeated as many times as that color has previously appeared in sequence plus one additional repetition. If ""walm"" is the first occurrence of that sequence, it simply takes on the color of the preceding word without repetition.

For instance:
1. If ""zup"" (which outputs ""yellow"") is followed by ""walm"", it outputs one ""yellow,"" because there is no repetition prior, just the color associated with ""zup.""
2. If ""wif"" (which outputs ""red"") is followed by ""walm"", it outputs ""red red red,"" because it's the third time the word ""wif"" appears (including ""walm"" as a repeat of ""wif"").
3. If ""lug"" (which outputs ""blue"") is followed by ""walm"", it outputs ""blue blue"" because ""lug"" appeared once prior to ""walm,"" so ""walm"" repeats the ""blue"" once more than it appeared before.

Using this rule, we can infer:

walm -> meaning (Rule: Repeat the color of the preceding word as many times as that color has been repeated previously in sequence plus one.)",0.9,13,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color mentioned right before it. We can see the repeated color by looking at the patterns in the provided inputs and outputs.

Rule:

- In ""zup walm lug zup wif dax,"" ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which translates to yellow, so ""walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow.""
- In ""zup lug walm wif walm,"" after ""lug"" which is blue, ""walm"" translates to ""blue blue,"" and after ""wif"" which is red, ""walm"" translates to ""red red red,"" indicating a repetition of the previous color for each instance of ""walf"".
- In ""wif walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which translates to red, so ""walm"" translates to ""red red red.""
- In ""zup walm lug wif,"" ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which is yellow, so ""walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow.""
- In ""wif dax lug walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which is blue, so ""walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue.""

- Every instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".
- When ""dax"" is presented alone, the output is ""green"".
- When ""dax"" is followed by other nonce words, there is a sequence of colors associated with each, suggesting that each nonce word translates to a specific color.

- ""wif"" translates to the color ""red""
- ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue""
- ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" has been presented only in the context of ""dax wif bluf,"" with the output ""green red red."" Because ""wif"" is already associated with ""red,"" we can infer that ""bluf"" also translates to ""red"".

Thus, ""dax"" is consistently associated with the color ""green,"" and the output colors are following a pattern based on the nonce words provided. 

dax -> green. When additional nonce words are present, they each correspond to a specific color.",1.0,14,dax
"dax -> green

Based on the examples provided, the word 'dax' consistently corresponds to the output 'green'. Therefore, the rule appears to be that whenever 'dax' is an input, the output is 'green'. The other words may correspond to different colors, but with the given examples, it is not possible to definitively determine the rules for the other words; however, 'lug' appears at least once with the output 'blue', so we might tentatively associate 'lug' with 'blue'.

Rule: When 'dax' is an input, the output is 'green'.",1.0,14,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that each nonce word is assigned a specific color. Here is the pattern observed:

- The word ""dax"" always results in the output ""green"".
- The word ""wif"" always results in the output ""red"".
- The word ""walm"" always results in the output ""red"".
- The word ""lug"" always results in the output ""blue"".
- The word ""zup"" always results in the output ""yellow"".
- The word ""bluf"" is not directly paired with a color in the examples, but given the pattern, it is likely resulting in the output ""red"" as well when in combination with ""dax"" and ""wif"".

Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" is:

Rule: dax -> green.

And by extension, for the other words:

- wif -> red
- walm -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> red (inferred)",1.0,14,dax
"Rule: wif -> red

This rule is concluded based on the consistent appearance of ""red"" after ""wif"" in each example provided.",1.0,14,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the consistent patterns where it appears.

In every instance, ""wif"" is followed by a color. Here's what we notice:

- When ""wif"" is adjacent to ""dax,"" the output is ""red"" following ""green.""
- When ""wif"" is adjacent to ""lug,"" the output is ""red"" following ""blue.""
- When ""wif"" precedes ""zup,"" the output is ""red"" following an omitted color (since ""zup"" does not appear in the output). This might indicate ""zup"" has no corresponding color or is irrelevant to the pattern.
- When ""wif"" occurs on its own (with no other nonce word context to define it), it outputs ""red.""

Given these mappings, the constant element associated with ""wif"" is the color ""red."" However, its position relative to other words might influence what color precedes it. For example, ""dax wif"" results in ""green red,"" ""lug wif"" gives ""blue red,"" and ""wif lug"" provides ""red blue."" Therefore, the context of the word that comes before or after ""wif"" influences the preceding color, but ""wif"" itself consistently corresponds to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,14,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently maps to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output in the same position relative to the other colors. No other input word consistently maps to ""red"" in these examples. Thus, it seems that ""wif"" is a nonce word representing the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,14,wif
"Rule: wif -> red

The evidence supporting this rule is consistent across all examples provided. In each case, regardless of the words that come before or after ""wif,"" the output associated with ""wif"" is always ""red"".",1.0,14,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"". It does not seem to change its meaning dependent on position or surrounding words. Every instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,14,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow"". Regardless of its position in the input sequence or the context provided by adjacent words, the presence of ""zup"" results in the word ""yellow"" in the output. Therefore, the rule I can deduce is:

zup -> meaning. Meaning: ""zup"" means ""yellow"".

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the output should include the word ""yellow"" corresponding to its position.",1.0,14,zup
"Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" can be deduced as:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow"".",1.0,14,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,14,zup

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.",1.0,14,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word zup is translated to the color yellow in the provided examples.",1.0,14,zup
"Rule: bluf -> the color of the word that immediately precedes it. If there is no preceding word, bluf is not defined.
- In Example 1, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"" because 'dax' is associated with the color green, and 'bluf' takes on the color of the preceding word.
- In Example 2, ""lug bluf wif"" translates to ""blue blue red"" because 'lug' is associated with blue, 'bluf' again takes on the color of the preceding word, which is blue, and 'wif' is associated with red.
- In Example 3, ""wif lug bluf"" translates to ""red blue blue"" for similar reasons; 'bluf' takes the color of 'lug', which is blue.
- In Example 4, ""wif bluf zup"" translates to ""red red yellow"" with 'bluf' taking the color red from 'wif'.
- In Example 5, ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"", with 'bluf' first matching 'zup' as yellow, then 'lug' as blue, and finally 'bluf' matches 'zup' as yellow again. 'Walm' is not defined but follows the pattern of repeating the color of 'zup', which is yellow.",1.0,14,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" results in an output color that matches the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. 

If we analyze the data:

1. ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"", so ""bluf"" means the same color as ""dax"" which is ""green"".
2. ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"", so ""bluf"" means the same color as ""lug"" which is ""blue"".
3. ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"", so ""bluf"" means the same color as ""wif"" which is ""red"".
4. ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"", so ""bluf"" means the same color as ""zup"" which is ""yellow"".
5. In the ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", which translates to ""yellow"", and precedes ""lug"", which translates to ""blue"". The output sequence is ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"", thus in the context of ""zup bluf"", ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"", the same as ""zup"".

This pattern suggests that ""bluf"" is not a color by itself but a repetition of the color indicated by the word before it.

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word immediately before it.",1.0,14,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it. If there is no word before ""bluf,"" it takes a default color, which in all the given examples is ""green."" The last example shows that when ""bluf"" is between two identical words, it takes on the color of those words.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word; if there is no preceding word, the default color is green.",1.0,14,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer a pattern regarding the word ""bluf"" and its corresponding output:

1. Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green
2. Input: lug bluf wif -> Output: blue blue red
3. Input: wif lug bluf -> Output: red blue blue
4. Input: wif bluf zup -> Output: red red yellow
5. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Observing the pattern, it seems that ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. The word ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word and repeats it once:

1. dax is associated with green, so bluf also becomes green.
2. lug is associated with blue, so bluf also becomes blue.
3. wif is associated with red, so bluf also becomes red.
4. zup is associated with yellow, so bluf also becomes yellow.

Therefore, the rule for the word ""bluf"" appears to be that it duplicates the color output of the immediately preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the preceding word.",1.0,14,bluf
"Based on the given examples, each instance of a word seems to be consistently associated with a specific color. It is also noticeable that the presence of ""bluf"" appears to correspond to the duplication of the color associated with the immediately preceding word. 

Here is the rule deduced from the examples:

- ""dax"" correlates with green, and ""bluf"" after ""dax"" produces another green.
- ""lug"" correlates with blue, and ""bluf"" after ""lug"" produces another blue.
- ""wif"" correlates with red, and ""bluf"" after ""wif"" produces another red.
- ""zup"" correlates with yellow, and ""bluf"" after ""zup"" produces another yellow.

So the rule seems to be:

bluf -> Duplicate the color of the preceding word.",1.0,14,bluf
"Rule: walm -> green.

In each input, when the word ""walm"" appears, the corresponding output is ""green."" Therefore, the rule deduced is that the nonce word ""walm"" translates to the color ""green.""",1.0,14,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let’s look at the output corresponding to its inclusion in different input sequences:

- Input: ""wif walm dax zup"" -> Output: ""red red red green yellow""
- Input: ""zup wif walm lug"" -> Output: ""yellow red red red blue""
- Input: ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> Output: ""red red green green green""
- Input: ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" -> Output: ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue""
- Input: ""wif walm dax zup"" -> Output: ""red red red green yellow""

By examining the input-output pairs, we can observe the following:

- Every time ""walm"" appears in the input, the output is ""red"" except the last occurrence of ""walm"" before a new color (other than blue) is introduced. In this case, the word preceding ""walm"" assumes its color, for this last occurrence, ""walm"" results in ""green"".
- ""wif"" and ""dax"" consistently correspond to ""red,"" while ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". ""bluf"" does not appear without ""walm"" following it, but when they are together, ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green"".
- Since ""walm"" can correspond to either ""red"" when not immediately before a new color except blue, and ""green"" when it is immediately before such change, it's reasonable to deduce that ""walm"" does not have a fixed color output. Instead, it's dependent on its position relative to other words.

Based on these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> ""red"" when followed by a word that corresponds to ""red"", ""blue"", or itself, and ""green"" when followed by a word that corresponds to any other color (e.g., ""yellow""). However, due to limited data, we cannot ascertain the color of ""walm"" if followed by an unfamiliar or not previously seen word, so our rule is potentially subject to exceptions.

Rule: walm -> ""red"" (following pattern) or ""green"" (preceding a new color other than blue).",0.8,14,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the outputs associated with the word's appearance in each example.

- In the first example, walm appears in the second position, and the output is red.
- In the second example, walm appears in the third position, and the output is red.
- In the third example, walm is in the fourth position, and the output is green.
- In the fourth example, walm is last in a sequence of six, and the output is blue.
- The fifth example is a repeat of the first and holds the same pattern, with walm in the second position and the output being red.

The color outputs seem dependent on position: 1st -> red, 2nd -> red, 3rd -> green, 4th -> green, 5th -> blue, 6th -> blue. Therefore, we can hypothesize that ""walm"" does not have a fixed color output associated with it; rather, the output color changes based on its position in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> The output color for ""walm"" follows the sequence-dependent rule: red for the 1st and 2nd positions, green for the 3rd and 4th positions, and blue for positions beyond that.",0.8,14,walm
"To induce the rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the examples provided and look for any patterns that emerge in relation to the word's position and corresponding output color.

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

2. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue

3. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

4. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

Looking at these examples, we can note the following:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears, the word just before it is colored red, and the word after it receives a color different from red (green or blue). However, ""dax"" follows ""walm"" twice and is colored green both times, which may indicate a specific pattern.

- The output color that follows ""walm"" doesn't seem to depend on ""walm"" itself but rather on the word following ""walm."" For instance, ""dax"" after ""walm"" consistently results in green and ""lug"" after ""walm"" in ""Input 4"" consistently results in blue.

Given these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" doesn't have its own color but it affects the color of the word that follows it. The word ""walm"" might be functioning as a modifier that ensures the word just before is ""red"" and that the next word adheres to a specific rule based on that next word itself rather than ""walm.""

However, with the limited examples, we cannot conclusively determine how ""walm"" affects the color of the word following it, as we only see two instances where ""dax"" follows and is green, and one instance of ""lug"" after ""walm"" being blue. Additional examples would be required to establish a more robust rule for the effects of ""walm"" on subsequent words' colors.

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in a sequence, the word just before it is red, and ""walm"" affects the color of the word following it, although the specific color appears to be determined by the word that comes after ""walm,"" not by ""walm"" itself.",0.8,14,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to analyze the pattern of the examples provided and the corresponding outputs. Let's examine each example and its output to try to identify any patterns that can help us determine what ""walm"" represents.

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
2. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
3. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
4. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

It's clear from the first and fifth examples, which are identical, that the output pattern for ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup"" stays consistent, and the presence of ""walm"" is associated with the color output ""red.""

In the second example, ""walm"" also results in an output of ""red,"" and in the third example, the output for ""walm"" is ""green."" Notice that in the third example, ""walm"" appears at the end, following a ""green"" output from ""dax,"" which could indicate a pattern where ""walm"" may mimic the color of the word prior to it.

However, in the fourth example, ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"" and the output for ""lug"" is ""blue,"" whereas the output for ""walm"" is ""green."" This contradicts the hypothesis that ""walm"" mimics the previous color.

Considering that each time ""walm"" appears, regardless of its position or the presence of other words, the output for ""walm"" is either red or green but not consistent with the surrounding words, we can rule out position-based meaning or a direct color association like the other words. Yet, it always results in either red or green, which suggests a kind of pattern.

Based on these observations, without further examples that specifically isolate the word ""walm,"" it is difficult to deduce a consistent rule or meaning for ""walm."" The given examples simply do not provide enough variability or consistency to draw a firm conclusion about the meaning or rule for ""walm"" based on the outputs provided.

- ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" and appears once before ""walm.""

Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" and appears once at the beginning.
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" and appears once after ""dax.""
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and appears once after the repetitions of ""red.""
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" and appears once at the end.

Considering the patterns in the input-output pairs, it seems that ""walm"" has the effect of repeating the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated.",1.0,15,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine its use in each example:

1. lug walm wif lug -> blue blue blue red blue
2. zup lug walm wif walm -> yellow blue blue blue red red red
3. zup wif dax walm -> yellow red green green green
4. wif lug dax walm -> red blue green green green
5. dax wif walm lug zup -> green red red red blue yellow

Observations:

- In every instance where ""walm"" appears, the word that follows ""walm"" is outputted three times with the color green.
- There are no instances where ""walm"" is the last word in the input, so we cannot observe the effect of ""walm"" without a following word.
- ""Walm"" itself does not have a single, consistent color associated with it, suggesting that ""walm"" likely changes the behavior of the following word rather than representing a color itself.

Rule:

walm -> When walm precedes a word, output the color corresponding to the following word three times.",1.0,15,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the examples and outputs given. Our goal is to identify a pattern associated with the occurrences of the word ""walm"" and its related output.

1. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue
   Here, ""lug"" correlates to ""blue"" and ""wif"" correlates to ""red,"" and ""walm"" occurs between ""lug"" and ""wif"" with an output of ""blue red.""

2. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" seems to be reinforcing the previous colors (blue and red) multiple times.

3. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" with ""walm"" appearing after ""dax"" and repeating the ""green"" color three times.

4. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green
   Once more, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color before it (""green"") multiple times.

5. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow
   Again, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and repeats the color ""red"" three times before the sequence moves on to ""lug"" which correlates to ""blue.""

From the above observations, we can deduce that the nonce word ""walm"" is used to repeat the color of the previous word three times in the output. 

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word three times.",1.0,15,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can analyze the pattern in the input and output sequences.

In every output sequence where ""walm"" appears in the input, it is followed by repeated instances of the same color. The number of repetitions and the specific color used varies depending on the context in which ""walm"" appears. For example:

- In the first input, ""walm"" is followed by one red: lug walm wif lug -> blue blue blue red blue.
- In the second input, ""walm"" is followed by three reds: zup lug walm wif walm -> yellow blue blue blue red red red.
- In the third and fourth inputs, ""walm"" is followed by two greens: 
    - zup wif dax walm -> yellow red green green green.
    - wif lug dax walm -> red blue green green green.
- In the fifth input, ""walm"" is followed by three reds: dax wif walm lug zup -> green red red red blue yellow.

Based on these examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" indicates that the color following it is repeated three times, except in the first example where the pattern is interrupted by the start of a new sequence (lug indicating a new sequence starting with ""blue""). If we consider ""walm"" marks the end of the sequence, and a new sequence starts with ""lug"" (based on the first example), it might explain the interruption. 

Rule: walm -> indicates the next color to be repeated three times unless a new sequence starts immediately after, which seems to be indicated by ""lug.""",0.8,15,walm
"Based on the provided input-output pairs, we can identify the following patterns:

- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""walm"" consistently translates to ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""blue.""

Now, taking into account the word ""lug"":

- In both ""lug wif"" and ""lug zup,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and the second word retains its individual color (""red"" for ""wif"" and ""yellow"" for ""zup"").
- In ""wif walm zup lug zup walm,"" ""lug"" is followed by a ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" and here ""lug"" precedes it as ""blue.""
- In the final example, ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif,"" ""lug"" is between ""zup"" (yellow) and ""bluf"" (blue), and in this case, ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

Given these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> ""blue""",1.0,16,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color blue.",1.0,16,lug
"Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be related to the translation of the nonce word ""lug"" and other words into colors. Each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. From the examples you provided, we can see the following patterns:

- Every time the word ""lug"" appears, the color ""blue"" is in the output.
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- The word ""walm"" is followed by two ""yellow"" and then by the number of ""walm"" +1 repetitions of ""yellow""

From these patterns, the rule for the nonce word ""lug"" can be deduced as:

lug -> blue",1.0,16,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: When the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color blue in the output.",1.0,16,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" is encountered in the input, it corresponds to the color blue in the output.",1.0,16,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at each example and the corresponding output:

1. wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug → red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
2. wif zup wif dax → red yellow red green
3. zup dax bluf → yellow green green
4. zup bluf lug dax lug → yellow yellow blue green blue
5. wif dax → red green

From the examples given, we can see that each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green."" In all cases, regardless of the position of “dax” in the input sequence, the color green is consistently outputted when “dax” is present in the input. This suggests that ""dax"" itself translates directly to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,16,dax
"Reviewing the given examples, I will identify the corresponding output for the nonce word ""dax"" and check for consistency across the examples.

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Input: wif zup wif dax
Output: red yellow red green

Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green

Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Input: zup bluf lug dax lug
Output: yellow yellow blue green blue

Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Input: wif dax
Output: red green

Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

In each example, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Based on the examples given, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" appears to be:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,16,dax
"Observing the patterns from the inputs and outputs given, we can deduce the following:

- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" translates to ""blue""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" 

In all instances where ""dax"" is present, the output color is ""green"". It does not seem to have any dependency on its position or surrounding words because regardless of its position, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,16,dax
"Based on the provided examples, each input word seems to correspond to a specific color in the output:

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- walm -> blue

When the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is always ""green"" regardless of its position:

- wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
- wif zup wif dax -> red yellow red green
- zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
- zup bluf lug dax lug -> yellow yellow blue green blue
- wif dax -> red green

This consistent pairing of ""dax"" with the color ""green"" suggests that ""dax"" represents the color green.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,16,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine the outputs associated with inputs that include the word ""dax"":

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug - Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
- In this example, ""dax"" precedes the first ""green.""

Input: wif zup wif dax - Output: red yellow red green
- ""dax"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""green.""

Input: zup dax bluf - Output: yellow green green
- ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf,"" and the output for ""dax"" is ""green,"" while ""bluf"" results in another ""green.""

Input: zup bluf lug dax lug - Output: yellow yellow blue green blue
- ""dax"" is followed by ""lug"" and the output is ""green.""

Input: wif dax - Output: red green
- ""dax"" again results in ""green.""

In all of these examples, irrespective of the words that come before or after ""dax,"" the output for ""dax"" is always ""green."" 

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,16,dax
"wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in each given example.",1.0,16,wif

"wif -> red. Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" across all examples, regardless of context or position.",1.0,16,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" directly translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" can be deduced as follows:

wif -> meaning. Rule:

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" 

Thus, the rule is:

zup -> yellow",1.0,16,zup
"Based on the given examples, ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" This conclusion is reached by analyzing the input and output pairs, where the occurrence of ""zup"" in the input consistently maps to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,16,zup
"Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the outputs. Here is the rule deduced from the examples:

"Based on the provided examples, it appears each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. Here’s the breakdown:

- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- bluf -> green (as evidenced by 'dax bluf wif dax' translating to 'green green red green' where 'dax' and 'bluf' both yield green)

From all the examples, we can observe that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Thus, the rule is:

zup -> yellow",1.0,16,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the provided examples. This is consistent across all examples where ""zup"" is present, regardless of its position within the sequence.",1.0,16,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" changes its meaning depending on the context, specifically, according to the word that precedes it. To determine the rule, let's analyze the input-output pairs:

1. ""zup wif bluf zup"" -> ""yellow red red yellow""
2. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
3. ""lug bluf dax bluf"" -> ""blue blue green green""
4. ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" -> ""blue red blue green green""
5. ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue""

Looking at the outputs corresponding to ""bluf"", it seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that comes before it:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"" in the output.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.
- In the third example, there are two instances of ""bluf"". The first ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", corresponding to ""blue"", and the second ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", corresponding to ""green"".
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" once again, leading to ""green"" as the output.
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", resulting in ""yellow"" in the output.

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" is a placeholder for a color word, and it adopts the color of the word that precedes it. If there is no word before ""bluf,"" then by default, it takes the color associated with ""zup"" which is ""yellow"" as seen in the second example.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the preceding word.",1.0,16,bluf
"Given the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" consistently correlates with the color immediately preceding its first occurrence in the input being repeated in place of every occurrence of ""bluf"" in the output. To illustrate:

- In the first input where ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", which outputs ""red"", both occurrences of ""bluf"" are replaced with ""red"" in the output.
- In the second input, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" that outputs ""yellow"", so ""bluf"" is replaced with ""yellow"".
- In the third input, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", which outputs ""blue"", so both ""bluf"" occurrences are replaced with ""blue"".
- Similarly, in the fourth input, the first occurrence of ""bluf"" again follows ""lug/dax"" which corresponds to ""blue/green"", thus ""bluf"" is translated as ""green"" since ""dax"" is the immediate precursor.
- In the fifth input, ""bluf"" first follows ""zup"", outputting ""yellow"", so it is replaced with ""yellow"" each time.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the word immediately preceding its first occurrence.",1.0,16,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze each example and look for patterns.

1. Input: zup wif bluf zup
   Output: yellow red red yellow

2. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow

3. Input: lug bluf dax bluf
   Output: blue blue green green

4. Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
   Output: blue red blue green green

5. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue

From examples 1 and 2, ""zup"" always results in ""yellow,"" so ""zup"" could mean ""yellow."" Similarly, ""lug"" seems to mean ""blue,"" as shown in examples 3, 4, and 5. ""Wif"" seems to result in ""red,"" while ""dax"" seems to result in ""green.""

Now, looking at ""bluf"" specifically:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" is between ""wif"" and ""zup,"" resulting in ""red yellow,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" might mean ""red"" when followed by ""zup.""
- In examples 2 and 5, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" or ""lug,"" and it results in yellow or blue, respectively, which implies that ""bluf"" could be repeating the color of the word before it.
- In example 3, both instances of ""bluf"" follow different words (""lug"" and ""dax"") but lead to the repetion of the previous color (both ""blue"" and ""green"").
- In example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and results in ""green,"" again suggesting it repeats the previous color.

Therefore, considering all these patterns, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> the word ""bluf"" represents a repeat of the color implied by the word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,16,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, bluf seems to correspond to the last color word mentioned before it. Here are the examples broken down:

- ""zup wif bluf zup"": ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"". However, since ""bluf"" results in ""red"" and not ""yellow"" from the last ""zup"", it shows that it is not simply a repeat of the last color, but rather takes the color of the word preceding it directly.
- ""zup bluf"": The repetition of ""yellow"" suggests that ""bluf"" takes the color preceding it, which in this case is ""yellow"".
- ""lug bluf dax bluf"": ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and so ""bluf"" here takes the color ""blue"". Then ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", so the next ""bluf"" takes the color ""green"".
- ""lug wif lug dax bluf"": Here we see ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", and the output is ""green"", consistent with the rule that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word directly before it.
- ""zup lug zup bluf lug"": In this sequence, ""bluf"" takes the color ""yellow"" from the last ""zup"", then the final ""lug"" is blue as expected.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word immediately preceding it. If ""zup"" precedes it, then ""bluf"" is yellow; if ""lug"" precedes it, then ""bluf"" is blue; if ""wif"" precedes it, then ""bluf"" is red; if ""dax"" precedes it, then ""bluf"" is green.",1.0,16,bluf
Rule: bluf -> repeat the last color mentioned.,0.0,16,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" does not have a fixed meaning, but rather its meaning changes depending on the context within the input sequence. To deduce the rule that defines the meaning of ""walm,"" we must look at the relationship between the input and the output in each example.

Input: dax zup walm wif
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

- ""dax"" outputs ""green""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

- ""dax"" outputs ""green""
- The only instance of ""walm"" here follows ""dax"" and outputs ""green,"" matching ""dax.""

Rule: walm -> takes on the color output of the preceding word.",1.0,16,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the word ""walm"" influences the output by repeating the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it. It seems to create repeated outputs of the same color until a new color is introduced by a different word. Here is the analysis:

- Example 1: ""dax zup walm wif"" gives ""green yellow yellow yellow red."" After ""walm"", the word ""wif"" leads to a color change.
- Example 2: ""zup wif walm lug"" gives ""yellow red red red blue."" After ""walm"", the word ""lug"" changes the color.
- Example 3: ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" results in ""red red green green red red red blue red."" After ""walm"", ""lug"" changes the color.
- Example 4: ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" yields ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue."" After ""walm"", no new word is introduced, so ""blue"" repeats.
- Example 5: ""dax walm"" generates ""green green green."" Since there's no word after ""walm,"" ""green"" repeats.

Rule: walm -> Causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the immediate preceding word until a new color is introduced by a different word.",1.0,16,walm
"To infer the meaning or rule governing the nonce word ""walm,"" let’s look at the pattern of colors associated with walm and the surrounding words.

The word ""walm"" seems to be associated with the color that appears directly after it. 

From the examples:

- ""walm wif"" -> ""yellow red,"" ""walm"" is followed by ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" is associated with ""red.""

- ""walm lug"" -> ""red red blue,"" ""walm"" is followed by ""red,"" and ""lug"" is associated with ""blue.""

- ""walm"" when it appears in the last position, like in ""wif zup bluf lug walm,"" all the remaining colors after ""walm"" are blue which is the color associated with the word right after walm in the other examples (""lug"").

- When only ""dax walm"" is given, it results in ""green green green,"" which implies ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it, in this case being the color associated with ""dax"".

Given this pattern, it seems that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that follows it, or repeats the color of the word before it when it is at the end of the sequence.

Rule: walm -> takes on the color of the next word in the sequence, or if at the end, repeats the color of the previous word.",0.9,16,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the input that correlate with the patterns in the output.

Let's examine each input and associated output:

Input: dax zup walm wif
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

- The word ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green.""
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red"" at the end.

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue

- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red.""
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue.""

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red

- ""wif"" correlates with ""red.""
- ""bluf"" correlates with ""green.""
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green.""
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue.""

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

- ""wif"" correlates with ""red.""
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" correlates with ""blue.""
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

- ""dax"" correlates with ""green.""

In all instances where ""walm"" appears, the output color is repeated thrice or multiple times in succession. It does not introduce a new color but seems to copy the color associated with the preceding word. Notably, ""walm"" is never the first word in the sequence, so it always has a preceding word to potentially copy. 

From this, we can derive the following rule:

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word that precedes it to be repeated multiple times in the output sequence.

With this rule, we can represent the meaning in the requested format:

walm -> causes the color of the preceding word to repeat.",0.9,16,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for consistent patterns in the input and output sequences.

Let's inspect each output sequence and see what color is assigned when ""walm"" appears:

1. When ""walm"" appears after ""dax zup,"" the color is yellow.
2. When ""walm"" appears after ""zup wif,"" the color is red.
3. When ""walm"" appears after ""bluf wif,"" the color is red.
4. When ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" the color is blue.
5. When ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" the color is green.

Based on the information above, the pattern is not straightforward at first glance. However, upon further analysis, we see that ""walm"" seems to duplicate the color of the word preceding it:

1. ""dax"" correlates with green → ""walm"" repeats the green once.
2. ""wif"" correlates with red → ""walm"" repeats the red twice.
3. ""lug"" correlates with blue → ""walm"" repeats the blue twice.
4. Without a preceding word, ""walm"" is green, which may be its default state when it follows ""dax"".

It seems the rule might be that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word immediately before it. When ""walm"" is at the start (after ""dax"" in the fifth input, which only has ""dax walm""), the default color seems to be green, possibly because ""dax"" has been associated with green elsewhere.

There is some ambiguity in the data, considering ""walm"" only follows a few specific words in the given examples, so this rule is the best approximation with the current data.

Rule: ""walm"" duplicates the color of the word immediately before it. If ""walm"" is following ""dax,"" which is associated with green, or appears in the beginning with no preceding word after ""dax,"" it defaults to green.",0.8,16,walm

"Based on the given examples, each instance of the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence. The context in which ""zup"" is used does not alter its meaning, indicating that ""zup"" consistently maps to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,17,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" can be inferred as follows:

In the first example, ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow"" when it appears as the first word and the third word.
In the second example, ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow"" when it appears as the third word.
In the third example, ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow"" when it appears as the fourth word.
In the fourth example, ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow"" when it appears as the second word.
In the fifth example, ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow"" when it appears as the first, second, and fifth words.

From these examples, it can be seen that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Hence, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,17,zup

Each example correlates the nonce word ""zup"" with the color ""yellow."" The position of the word ""zup"" in the input sequence does not alter its associated output, which consistently remains ""yellow.""",1.0,17,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""zup"" has a consistent translation to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is used in the input, it corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position or the words around it.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,17,zup
"Analyzing the given examples, we can attempt to identify a pattern for the word ""bluf"" by looking at the corresponding output colors:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green
2. Input: zup lug bluf -> Output: yellow blue blue
3. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup -> Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
4. Input: lug wif lug dax bluf -> Output: blue red blue green green
5. Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup -> Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow

Let's look at each instance where ""bluf"" appears and its output:

- ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red""
- ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue""
- ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow""
- ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green""

Given this pattern, it appears that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it. In other words:

""bluf"" -> meaning. The meaning is that ""bluf"" duplicates the color of the preceding word. Rule: If a word's color is X, then ""word bluf"" translates to ""X X"".",1.0,17,bluf
"Rule: Bluf corresponds to the color green. 

The word ""bluf"" in all the given input examples consistently leads to the color ""green"" in the output. Each non-bluf word in the inputs maps to a different color in the outputs, but ""bluf"" consistently maps to ""green.""

Therefore, bluf -> green.",1.0,17,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""green."" 

Evidence:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" corresponds to ""red red green green green."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green,"" and ""bluf"" to the second ""green."" ""Walm"" is not shown before, but corresponds to the last ""green.""
- In the second example, ""zup lug bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue."" ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to the first ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" would then correspond to the second ""blue"" (but since ""lug"" already corresponds to ""blue,"" this suggests ""bluf"" likely means ""green,"" because there's no direct repetition in the color sequence).
- Looking further, across all examples where ""bluf"" is used, it corresponds to ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position or the surrounding words.

Therefore: bluf -> green.",1.0,17,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we can look for patterns in the given examples. Let's analyze each example's input and corresponding colors in the output:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red.
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green.
   - ""walm"" presumably corresponds to green (since it's the only word in this line not accounted for, and it assumes the same output color as ""dax"").

2. Input: zup lug bluf
   Output: yellow blue blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
   - ""lug"" correspond to blue.

3. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
   Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
   - Reaffirms that ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""wif"" corresponds to red.
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green.

4. Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
   Output: blue red blue green green
   - Reaffirms that ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""dax"" corresponds to green.

5. Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
   Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
   - Reaffirms that ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""lug"" corresponds to blue.

Now, by identifying the position of ""bluf"" in each input and looking at the resulting color in the output, we can try to deduce the rule for ""bluf"":

- In Examples 1 and 4, ""bluf"" is followed by ""green."" In Example 1, it is a stand-alone green, but in Example 4, it was followed by the same color, which is ""dax"" that we already know corresponds to green.
- In Example 2, ""bluf"" alone gives us ""blue.""
- In Example 3 and 5, ""bluf"" is followed by colors that correspond to words immediately succeeding the instances of ""bluf"" (red and blue, respectively).

Based on the observed pattern where ""bluf"" results in a color matching its subsequent word or a color on its own, it appears that the rule for ""bluf"" may be that it takes on the color of the word that follows it, and if no word follows, it defaults to blue.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately after it. If there is no succeeding word, ""bluf"" corresponds to blue.

bluf -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: ""bluf"" mimics the color of the following word, or is blue by default.",0.9,17,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the pattern of colors in the output relative to the position of ""bluf"" in the input in each example.

Input: wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green
Input: zup lug bluf -> Output: yellow blue blue
Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup -> Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
Input: lug wif lug dax bluf -> Output: blue red blue green green
Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup -> Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow

Analyzing the outputs, the following can be noted:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax walm,"" which corresponds to ""green green green."" There is no immediate pattern visible here.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" by itself corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""wif,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow red,"" but this breaks the pattern from the second example.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is at the end, after ""dax,"" and it corresponds to ""green green."" Here we can see that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" which could hint that ""bluf"" by itself triggers an additional ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" appears twice in different positions. ""Bluf dax"" corresponds to ""green green,"" and so does ""dax lug bluf."" This suggests that ""bluf"" following ""dax"" keeps a ""green green"" pattern, while ""bluf"" preceding ""dax"" has the same output.

From these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" may affect the color change to ""green."" However, the pattern is dependent on the context, and further examples would help refine the rule. 

Given this information, we can tentatively postulate the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> meaning: Causes the output to be ""green,"" with the exact shade or repetition of ""green"" seemingly influenced by the words immediately preceding or following it, specifically with ""dax"" being present. This rule is, however, not conclusive due to limited data and apparent inconsistencies in the examples provided. Further examples could help confirm or refine this rule.",0.3,17,bluf
"walm -> repeats the color of the previous word in the sequence three times.

Rule: If the previous word translates to a color, walm replicates that color three times in the output.",1.0,17,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to result in a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it. The number of times the color is repeated corresponds to the number of times ""walm"" is mentioned consecutively. 

For instance, in the first example, ""dax zup walm"" results in ""green yellow yellow yellow,"" which means ""walm"" induces a repetition of ""yellow"" (the color associated with ""zup"") three times. Similarly, in the second example, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" which indicates that ""walm"" causes ""green"" (the color associated with ""dax"") to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word as many times as ""walm"" appears consecutively.",1.0,17,walm
"Based on the outputs given for each input, we can observe that:

1. When 'walm' is mentioned once, three additional words of the color indicated by the preceding word are added to the output.
2. When 'walm' is mentioned after a color word, it repeats that color word's output three times. 

From the examples:
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green""
- ""lug wif walm"" results in ""blue red red red"" (where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red"", and then ""walm"" causes ""red"" to repeat three times)

So, the rule we can deduce is that ""walm"" causes the last color word preceding it to be outputted three additional times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last color word three times.",1.0,17,walm
"walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" appears to be repeating the color of the previous word mentioned in the sequence. The general rule is repetition of the previous color in the sequence.

Rule: When ""walm"" is used in a sequence, the output color is the same as the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"".",1.0,17,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color denoted by the word preceding it. Each instance of ""walm"" is replaced by multiple instances of the color that comes immediately before it. Here's how it maps out specifically:

- dax walm -> green green green (since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"")
- lug wif walm -> red red red (since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", replacing ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"")
- dax walm wif walm -> green green green red red red (two separate instances where ""walm"" takes on the color before it: ""dax"" being ""green"" and ""wif"" being ""red"")

- ""zup dax"" translates to ""yellow green""

From these examples, we can observe that:

1. The word ""dax"" corresponds to the output color ""green"" every time it appears.

- When ""wif"" precedes a word as in ""wif lug"", it does not appear to influence the order of the output colors but still results in ""red"" appearing in the output.
- When ""wif"" is in a sequence with more than two words, as in ""zup dax wif"", ""red"" is still the last color in the output.

Given these observations, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output sequence. Furthermore, it does not change the order of other colors already determined by the other words in the input. Based on this, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be:

2. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
   Analysis: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and the pattern repeats just like in the previous output for ""walm.""

3. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   Analysis: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" followed by ""walm,"" resulting in two extra ""green"" (three total). ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and the sequence repeats with ""dax"" and ""walm"" resulting in a pattern of three ""green"" again.

4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Analysis: ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" and we see the three ""green"" pattern repeating just as before.

5. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
   Analysis: ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in three ""yellow."" Then ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" followed by ""zup"" which is ""yellow"", then ""dax"" again is ""green"", followed by ""red"" for ""wif.""

Rule:
- The word ""walm"" appears to create a pattern where it triples the color of the preceding word. If ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" then ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow."" If ""lug"" is ""blue,"" then ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue."" If ""dax"" is ""green,"" then ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green.""

"Based on the given examples, each input word seems to correspond to a specific output color. The color that appears following the word ""walm"" is repeated three times regardless of the word that comes after ""walm"". This suggests that ""walm"" indicates the repetition of a color three times. To identify the color that corresponds to ""walm"", we can look at the unique word that precedes it in each example.

For instance:
- ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""yellow red red red"", which implies ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". The ""red red red"" that follows suggests ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"".
- ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""blue blue blue red"", which indicates ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" again corresponds to ""red"".
- ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""green green green"", which indicates ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" since it is not followed by any other words here.

By looking at all the examples, it appears that ""walm"" consistently translates to ""red"" repeated three times. This is regardless of the word that comes before it, which determines the color before the sequence of reds.

"Rule: wif -> red

The examples indicate that whenever the word ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red"". The other outputs are consistent with the presence of different words (""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", ""walm"" to ""red""), but each occurrence of ""wif"" is consistently followed by ""red"", regardless of the other words present.",1.0,19,wif
"From the provided examples, it seems that each word corresponds to a color and that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" Here's how this conclusion is reached:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears, the color ""red"" also appears in the output.
- The placement of ""wif"" in the input directly corresponds to the placement of ""red"" in the output, regardless of the other words around it.
- Looking at the first example, ""wif dax"" gives ""red green,"" suggesting that ""dax"" maps to ""green.""
- In the second example, the repetition of ""lug"" and the repetition of ""blue"" in the output suggest that ""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" while ""zup"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""yellow"" due to their placement relative to the output.
- The third example reinforces that ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow.""
- The fourth example shows that ""walm"" is repeated thrice and so is the color ""red""; however, we have already associated ""wif"" with ""red."" Given that this example has no new words, it suggests that ""wif"" does indeed mean ""red,"" and the repetition of ""red"" is due to the word ""walm"" repeating. However, since ""walm"" also appears in the fifth example but produces ""blue,"" based on the context ""walm"" in this example is likely a repeater of the preceding color, thus here, it repeats ""red"" from ""wif.""
- The fifth example shows ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and the repetition of ""blue"" might indicate that ""walm"" repeats the previous color again. Then ""wif"" occurring again maps to ""red,"" following the pattern.

The surrounding context influences the meaning of ""walm,"" but the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red,"" no matter the context.

From Observation 1: 
When ""wif"" is followed by ""dax,"" we get ""red green."" 

From Observation 2:
The repeated structure ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue."" 
The word ""zup"" is followed by just ""yellow,"" and since ""wif lug"" is repeated without ""zup"" in the middle, we see ""yellow"" is not included in the segment ""red blue red blue.""

From Observation 3:
When ""wif"" is followed by ""zup,"" we get ""red yellow.""

From Observation 4:
When ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" and then ""zup,"" we get three ""red"" colors in a row and then ""yellow."" This might imply that ""walm"" could be reinforcing the color ""red"" or can be translated as ""red"" itself since ""wif zup"" gives us ""red yellow.""

From Observation 5:
The segment ""lug walm"" without ""wif"" being involved gives us two ""blue"" colors, and then ""wif zup"" gives us ""red yellow."" When ""wif"" appears by itself at the end, we get ""red.""

From these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""wif"":

- ""wif"" by itself translates to ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is followed by another word, it still starts with ""red"" but the following colors depend on the word that comes after ""wif."" 

Hence the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> ""red"" followed by the color representation of any word(s) that come after it.

Based on the examples, it seems the other words could potentially translate as follows, though without further examples, these translations might not be complete:
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> red

For instance:
- In the first input, ""lug wif lug bluf"", ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", ""wif"" translates to ""red"", and the second ""lug"" again to ""blue"". ""Bluf"" follows the second ""lug"" so it results in another ""blue"".
- In the fourth input, ""dax bluf zup bluf dax"", the second ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow"", hence we get another ""yellow"" for that ""bluf"".

Taking a close look at the first and second examples, 'dax' directly follows 'lug' and precedes 'bluf,' and the following colors are 'green.' Therefore, we can preliminarily conclude that 'dax' likely translates to 'green.'

Examining the third example, where 'dax' precedes 'walm lug,' the output is 'green green green blue,' suggesting that 'walm' and 'lug' produce 'green' and 'blue,' respectively, once again reinforcing that 'dax' is 'green.' 

In the fourth example, 'wif lug dax walm' turns into 'red blue green green green.' Since 'wif' and 'lug' correspond to 'red' and 'blue' before 'dax' appears, and following 'dax,' we have 'walm,' which previous examples suggest corresponds to 'green,' this sequence supports the idea that 'dax' represents 'green.'

Finally, the fifth example, 'zup dax wif,' becomes 'yellow green red.' Given that the colors following 'zup' and 'wif' are 'yellow' and 'red,' it further supports the consistency that 'dax' is represented by 'green.'

- In the second example, ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" seems to correspond to ""red"" (though it's probably meant to be ""blue"" due to the later examples, suggesting a possible error in this output), ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" yields ""yellow.""

3. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" results in a sequence where ""zup"" precedes ""lug walm wif dax"" and the output sequence starts with ""yellow"" followed by colors that correspond to the other words.
4. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"", indicating that ""zup"" and ""walm"" have the same color output.
5. ""zup lug walm"" gives ""yellow blue blue blue"", again with ""zup"" at the beginning.

The pattern suggests that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Furthermore, ""zup"" at the beginning of an input sequence results in ""yellow"" at the beginning of the color sequence. When ""zup"" is placed next to another word that would normally output another color, it seems to change the output for that word to ""yellow"" as well.

Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" If ""zup"" precedes another word that has a corresponding color, it turns that word's output into ""yellow"" as well. If ""zup"" follows other words, it only outputs ""yellow"" for its own position and does not affect the preceding words.

If ""bluf"" appears at the end of a sequence or without a preceding color-associated word, then it defaults to the color yellow.

Let's analyze the examples:

1. dax bluf lug wif: ""dax"" results in the color green, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" which then also becomes green, and ""wif"" translates to red.
2. wif bluf zup: ""wif"" is red, ""bluf"" makes ""zup"" also turn red, and ""zup"" on its own is yellow.
3. lug bluf zup lug: ""lug"" is blue, ""bluf"" makes ""zup"" also blue, and the final ""lug"" is also blue.

5. zup bluf wif walm: ""zup"" is yellow, ""bluf"" makes ""wif"" also yellow, and ""walm"" causes a repetition of ""wif"" which maintains the color red.

With these observations, the rule can be established as:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" causes the following word to take on the color associated with the preceding word. If there is no word after ""bluf,"" or it is not preceded by a color-associated word, then ""bluf"" represents the color yellow.

"bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word

Rule: The word ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated in the output. For example, if the word before ""bluf"" is ""lug"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" then ""bluf"" causes another ""blue"" to appear in the output sequence.",1.0,20,bluf

3. dax walm lug
    - green green green blue

4. zup wif walm lug
    - yellow red red red blue

5. wif bluf dax walm
    - red red green green green

Looking at the examples, the color that follows ""walm"" in the input corresponds with the color red in the output. However, we notice that the color before ""walm"" is repeated twice in the output, once before red and once after (e.g., in example 3, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and in the output, we see ""green red green;"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, resulting in ""green green green blue"").

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the next color to be red and the preceding color to repeat once before red and once after red.

Rule: walm -> causes the next color in the sequence to be red, and repeats the previous color in the output once before and once after red.",0.8,20,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for the patterns relating to its presence in the examples.

Input: dax wif **walm** lug zup

Input: lug wif dax zup **walm**
Output: blue red green yellow **yellow** yellow

Input: dax **walm** lug
Output: green **green** green blue

Input: zup wif **walm** lug
Output: yellow red **red** red blue

Input: wif bluf dax **walm**
Output: red red green **green** green

By examining these instances, we can determine that the output color sequence contains one or more repetition of the color that is immediately after ""walm"". Notice also that the repetition ends just before the occurrence of a new color that was not present immediately before ""walm"".

So, based on these observations, we can establish the rule for ""walm"" as follows:

walm -> Replicate the color that immediately follows it until a new color code (that is not a repetition) appears in the sequence.",0.8,20,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the correlation between the input and output across the given examples.

Input: dax wif walm lug zup

Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The word ""walm"" corresponds to ""red.""

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

Once again, ""lug"" aligns with ""blue,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow."" This time, ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: dax walm lug
Output: green green green blue

Here, ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" ""Walm"" corresponds to ""green.""

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue

In this example, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" ""Walm"" is ""red.""

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" Since ""bluf"" is not present in other examples and corresponds to ""red"" here, it's unclear exactly what it represents, but we don't need it to figure out ""walm."" ""Walm"" corresponds to ""green.""

From these examples, it's clear that the meaning of ""walm"" is not tied to a specific color, but rather, seems to be taking on the color of the color word preceding it. If it's not followed by any other word with an established color, it repeats the color of the most recent valid color word.

Rule: walm -> takes on the color of the preceding color-associated word. If no preceding color word is given, it repeats the color of the word before it.",0.8,20,walm
"To determine what the meaning of ""walm"" might be, let's take a look at each example and identify any patterns or rules about the colors they correspond to.

First Example:
Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow

Second Example:
Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

Third Example:
Input: dax walm lug
Output: green green green blue

Fourth Example:
Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue

Fifth Example:
Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

In each instance, ""walm"" is correlated with the color red, except for instances where ""walm"" follows ""dax"", where it then correlates with the color green. Looking at the second example, it's clear that the color that follows ""walm"" is yellow regardless of its position, suggesting that ""walm"" also implies the color following it should be yellow.

Thus, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" results in the color that ""dax"" elicits, except when ""walm"" also impacts the color that follows it, mandating that color to be yellow.

Rule:
walm -> takes the color associated with ""dax"" (which is green) but also ensures the following word/color is yellow. If ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence and there's no following word, it takes the color associated with ""dax"" only.",0.8,20,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the use of the word in different positions and contexts within the given inputs and the corresponding outputs.

1. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"":
   - ""dax wif walm lug zup"" -> green red red red blue yellow
   - ""zup wif walm lug"" -> yellow red red red blue
   Both outputs feature ""red red"" immediately following ""wif.""

2. When ""walm"" ends a sequence:
   - ""zug wif dax zup walm"" -> blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   The output is ""yellow yellow yellow"" at the end.

3. When ""walm"" is between ""dax"" and ""lug"":
   - ""dax walm lug"" -> green green green blue
   - ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> red red green green green
   In both these cases, ""walm"" is associated with the color green.

4. When ""walm"" follows ""lug"":
   - ""lug wif dax zup walm"" -> blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   The output color is ""yellow"" when ""walm"" follows ""lug.""

By examining the instances where ""walm"" is used and what follows or precedes it in the input and the output sequences, we can establish a pattern:

""lug"" is associated with blue, ""dax"" is associated with green, and ""wif"" is associated with red. The color following ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the previous word.

Thus, the rule induced from the above examples would be that ""walm"" causes the next color to repeat the color associated with the word just before ""walm.""

"Rule: dax -> green.

Each instance of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of the preceding or following words.",1.0,21,dax
"Given the examples, we can infer a pattern that associates each word with a color. The word ""dax"" appears to consistently translate to the color ""green."" Let's analyze each input and output to confirm this:

1. Input: zup dax
   Output: yellow green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

2. Input: lug dax walm
   Output: blue green green green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - The repetition of ""green green"" might suggest ""walm"" correlates with double ""green,"" but with the information given, the repetition could also be a consequence of ""dax"" appearing once rather than ""walm"" contributing to any color. More examples with ""walm"" are needed to reach a definitive conclusion.

3. Input: zup dax lug zup
   Output: yellow green blue yellow
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

4. Input: wif dax zup dax
   Output: red green yellow green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

5. Input: dax bluf zup
   Output: green green yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - This example introduces ""bluf,"" which also correlates with ""green,"" but we only have one instance of ""bluf"" to analyze.

In every instance of ""dax,"" the output is consistently ""green,"" regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence or the words around it. The other words (""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""bluf"") are all directly followed by their corresponding color in the output sequences, indicating they each represent a single color that does not change based on context or position.

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" 

dax -> green",1.0,21,dax
"Considering the examples provided and the consistent output associated with each input, we can induce the following:

- ""zup"" consistently results in the output ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" consistently results in the output ""blue.""
- ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red.""
- ""dax"" when accompanied by other words, always results in ""green"" following the ""dax,"" regardless of what the other words are.
- It also appears that the word immediately following ""dax"" is repeated as ""green"" in the sequence.

From this, we can deduce that the word ""dax"" has the following rule associated with it:

Rule: When ""dax"" appears in an input, the output is ""green"" followed by the color corresponding to the next word in the input sequence. If there are words before ""dax,"" their corresponding colors are output before the ""green."" If ""dax"" is the last word in the sequence, ""green"" is the final color in the output.

Therefore, the meaning assigned to ""dax"" in this context is as follows:

dax -> The output is ""green"" followed by the output associated with the next word. If ""dax"" is followed by another instance of ""dax,"" ""green"" is output consecutively.",1.0,21,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's analyze the given examples and look for patterns in the context of the word's usage and the corresponding outputs.

Output: blue green green green

Input: zup dax lug zup
Output: yellow green blue yellow

Input: wif dax zup dax
Output: red green yellow green

Input: dax bluf zup
Output: green green yellow

Based on the examples above, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the word ""green"" in the outputs. It appears that ""dax"" directly translates to the color ""green,"" or it acts as a modifier that produces ""green"" thereafter. There is no change in output correlated with the position of ""dax"" in the input or with the surrounding words. Therefore, we can conclude:

Rule: dax -> ""green""
",1.0,21,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input string or the other words present with it.",1.0,21,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we need to look for patterns in the examples provided. Here's how ""wif"" is used in each example:

3. Input: wif dax | Output: red green
4. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm | Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
5. Input: zup wif walm | Output: yellow red red red

From the examples, we can see that whenever ""wif"" is used, it is followed by the color ""red"" in the output. This pattern holds regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,21,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" seems to consistently translate to the color ""red."" No matter the position of ""wif"" within the input sequence or the other words around it, the output always includes ""red"" in the position correlating to where ""wif"" appears in the input.

Here are the examples broken down:

- Input: wif -> Output: red
- Input: lug zup wif zup -> Output: blue yellow red yellow
  - ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""wif"" to red.
- Input: wif dax -> Output: red green 
  - ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""wif"" to red
- Input: wif zup bluf lug walm -> Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue 
  - ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""zup"" to the first yellow, ""bluf"" seems to influence the output to include triple blue but ""lug"" is known to be blue as well, while ""walm"" seems to correspond to a double blue.
- Input: zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red
  - ""zup"" translates to yellow, ""wif"" to red, and ""walm"" seems to repeat the color before it three times, hence the triple red.

Rule:
wif -> red",1.0,21,wif
"Based on the given examples, the following rule can be deduced:

Rule: wif -> red

Evidence for the rule:
1. When wif appears alone as an input, the output is red.
2. When wif appears within a sequence, the corresponding output for wif is always red.

To further support this conclusion with available data:
- In the second example, 'lug zup wif zup', wif corresponds to 'red', which remains consistent with the first example.
- The third example, 'wif dax', also supports the rule as wif translates to 'red' and dax to 'green'.
- The fourth example, 'wif zup bluf lug walm', maintains the association with 'red', while zup, bluf, lug, and walm correspond to 'yellow', 'yellow', 'blue', and 'blue blue blue' respectively.
- In the fifth example, 'zup wif walm', wif corresponds to 'red', aligning with the previously established rule.

Therefore, the rule is that the nonce word 'wif' signifies the color 'red'.",1.0,21,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let us examine the correlation between the input and output in each example:

- When the input is solely ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""
- When ""wif"" appears in a sequence with ""zup"" and other words, it always corresponds to ""red.""
- Regardless of its position in a sequence (beginning, middle, or end), ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red.""

From the given data, we can infer that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" All instances of the word ""wif"" in the input result in the word ""red"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,21,wif
"Based on the examples given and the corresponding outputs, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" appears to be as follows:

- Whenever ""bluf"" is in the input, ""red"" follows in the output.
- Whenever ""lug"" is in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output.
- ""Zup"" appears to consistently correspond with ""yellow"" in the output.

Given this information, the pattern indicates that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Every time ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:
bluf -> yellow",1.0,21,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the output color to be repeated three times and to match the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm."" To demonstrate the rule more clearly:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output immediately following ""walm"" is three ""green,"" which is the color associated with ""dax.""

In the second example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" and since ""zup"" on its own translates to ""yellow,"" we can assume ""walm"" repeats the prior color three times.

In the third example, ""wif walm dax"" translates to ""red red red green,"" which again shows that ""walm"" is followed by three repetitions of the color associated with ""wif"" before ""dax"" changes the pattern.

In the fourth example, ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue,"" where ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and we again see the color blue repeated three times.

The fifth example also supports this rule, as ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and there are three repetitions of ""blue"" before the sequence changes with ""zup lug.""

   Note: The sequence goes from ""zup"" (yellow) to ""dax"" (green), then  to ""lug"" (blue), followed by ""walm"" which repeats ""blue"" three times before the next ""zup"" introduces ""yellow,"" and it ends with ""lug"" as ""blue"".

Rule:
walm -> causes the last mentioned color to be repeated a number of times equivalent to the number of subsequent ""lug"" words, until interrupted by a new color or the end of the input sequence. If no ""lug"" word follows ""walm,"" it repeats the color three times by default or until the next color word.",1.0,22,walm
"Analyzing the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" influences the output of the colors that follow it. The color output repeats the color corresponding to the word just preceding ""walm,"" for a number of times equal to the total number of words that follow ""walm.""

Let's look at the examples:

1. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   Explanation: ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and it's followed by one ""lug,"" which is ""blue."" The output repeats ""yellow"" three times before the final ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Explanation: ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and there are no words after ""walm."" Hence, ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

3. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   Explanation: ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which is ""red,"" and it's followed by one ""dax,"" which is ""green."" The output repeats ""red"" three times before the final ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Explanation: ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and there is no word after ""walm."" Therefore, ""blue"" is repeated three times.

5. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   Explanation: ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and it's followed by two words: ""zup"" which is ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" again which is ""blue."" The output includes ""blue"" three times, then continues with the final ""zup"" and ""lug.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it to repeat for a number of times equal to the number of words that follow ""walm.""

Thus, the meaning is:

walm -> meaning: Causes repetition of the preceding color for the number of terms that follow.",1.0,22,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" has a meaning that is dependent on the word that comes directly before it. The output for ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word for a certain number of times. Let's analyze the patterns:

1. When 'lug' comes before 'walm', 'walm' results in 'blue' being repeated three times.
2. When 'zup' comes before 'walm', 'walm' results in 'yellow' being repeated three times.
3. When 'wif' comes before 'walm', 'walm' results in 'red' being repeated two times.
4. When 'dax' comes before 'walm', 'walm' results in 'green' being repeated once.

From these observations, the general rule seems to be that ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color code of the preceding word, with the number of repetitions likely being determined by the position of that word in a predetermined list. Where 'lug' is first, 'zup' is second, 'wif' is third, and 'dax' is fourth—thus, the number of repetitions follows an inversely ordinal sequence (three repetitions for the first, two for the second, one for the third, and so on).

Therefore, the rule appears to be: ""walm"" -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word a number of times based on the order of that color word's first appearance in the list, following a reverse order (three times if first, twice if second, once if third).

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word inversely to the order of first appearance in the examples.",0.9,22,walm

- When ""dax"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""lug"", the output is ""green"" before ""blue"".
- The context does not change the output associated with ""dax"".

"Based on the provided examples, we can infer that each unique input word corresponds to a specific output word (color).

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine the common elements in each input-output pair where ""bluf"" is present.

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red

Here, ""bluf"" is associated with the second instance of the color red.

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

Again, here ""bluf"" is associated with the second instance of the color red.

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

Once more, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second red.

Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

In this sequence, each instance of ""bluf"" corresponds to a red color following a green or a yellow.

Input: dax bluf wif zup
Output: green green red yellow

And once again, ""bluf"" is followed by the color red.

Considering the pattern in each case, ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color red. The condition seems to be that ""bluf"" equates to red when following another color, without any condition specific to the position or the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> red",1.0,23,bluf
Rule: bluf -> red,1.0,23,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red

Each instance of ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the output ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,23,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can observe the following pattern:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow red.""
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red.""
3. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green.""
4. When ""bluf"" follows another ""bluf,"" the output is not explicitly shown.

Given this pattern, it appears that the meaning of ""bluf"" in the output is dependent on the word that precedes it. The word that comes before ""bluf"" determines the color that is outputted twice. Here are the rules that we can deduce:

- If ""zup"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow"" twice.
- If ""wif"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output is ""red"" twice.
- If ""dax"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output is ""green"" twice.

Rule: If a word (X) comes before ""bluf,"" the output is the color associated with word (X) repeated twice.

Therefore, bluf -> meaning: The meaning of ""bluf"" is to duplicate the color associated with the preceding word in the sequence.",0.9,23,bluf
Rule: bluf -> green,0.0,23,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer that the word ""walm"" translates to ""red red red"". Each time ""walm"" appears in an input, the output consistently shows three ""red"" in a row. 

Therefore, the rule can be described as:

Walm -> meaning: ""red red red"". The presence of ""walm"" within an input sequence always results in the consecutive output of the color ""red"" three times.",1.0,23,walm
"To decipher the meaning of ""walm"", we should look for patterns and repetitions in the input and output examples provided, noting down any consistent associations between the word ""walm"" and the corresponding colors in the output.

Let's examine each case where ""walm"" is used:

1. In ""zup wif walm"", the output is ""yellow red red red"". ""Walm"" follows ""wif"" and results in two additional ""red"" entries beyond the expected single ""red"" from ""wif"".
2. In ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"", the output is ""blue green yellow green green green red"". Again, ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" and produces two additional ""green"" entries beyond the expected single ""green"" from ""dax"".
3. In ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"", the output is ""green green green red blue green green green"". Each time ""walm"" appears after ""dax"", it is followed by two more ""green"" than expected if there was just ""dax"".
4. In ""dax walm"", the output is ""green green green"". The standalone ""dax"" typically outputs ""green"", but we see two additional ""green"" as a result of ""walm"".
5. In ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"", the output is ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"". When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", or ""zup"", it produces a sequence of two additional colors corresponding to the word it follows (""wif"" gives ""red"" and ""zup"" gives ""yellow""), and when it follows ""zup"", it results in two more ""yellow"".

From these observations, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it two additional times. When no word precedes ""walm"", it outputs three of the corresponding color, which suggests the default repeat might be three times if it's the first word or occurs standalone.

Based on this, we can conclude:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color output associated with the preceding word two additional times. If ""walm"" is the first word or standalone, it repeats the color output three times.

Therefore: walm -> repeats the previous color two more times (or three times if occurring first or standalone).",1.0,23,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the color associated with the word that directly precedes it three times. Examining the instances of ""walm"" in each example:

1. ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red"" – here, ""walm"" causes ""red"" (the color associated with ""wif"") to be repeated three times.
   
2. ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" translates to ""blue green yellow green green green red"" – in this case, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""green"" is repeated three times.
   
3. ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" translates to ""green green green red blue green green green"" – both instances of ""walm"" cause the preceding color ""green"" (associated with ""dax"") to be repeated three times.
   
4. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"" – ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the color ""green"" is repeated three times.
   
5. ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" translates to ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"" – the first ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times, and the second ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color associated with the directly preceding word to be repeated three times.",1.0,23,walm
"walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" appears to be the word ""green"" repeated three times.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" is present in the input, the output is always ""green green green"".",1.0,23,walm
"From examining the given examples, we can make the following observations:

- In each case, the word ""walm"" leads to multiple instances of the same color in the output.
- The number of repetitions of that color is always three.
- The specific color that is repeated is always 'green'.

Now, let's analyze how ""walm"" interacts with the other words:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which outputs ""yellow,"" it produces ""green red red red"".
2. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which outputs ""green,"" it produces ""green green green"".
3. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which outputs ""red,"" it produces ""red red red"".

Notice that the color that is repeated three times is not dependent on ""walm"" alone, but rather on the color word that appears immediately before it:

- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow red red red"", where ""zup"" is yellow and ""walm"" changes the following color to red and repeats it three times.
- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"", where ""wif"" is red and ""walm"" repeats that color three times.
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"", where ""dax"" is green, which is the same color ""walm"" repeats.

From this, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"": ""walm"" causes the next color to be the same as the color immediately preceding ""walm,"" and that color is repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be stated as:

Rule: walm -> causes the next color to repeat three times, taking on the color of the word immediately preceding it.",0.9,23,walm
"Based on the provided examples and their corresponding outputs, it seems that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue.""

- Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output.
- ""Dax"" doesn't seem to modify the meaning of the other words (e.g., ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" with or without ""dax"" in the input).
- The position of ""dax"" in the input doesn't affect its meaning in the output; ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green"" whether it is at the beginning, middle, or end of the input.
  
Therefore, the rule we can induce for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" is:

"dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.",1.0,24,dax
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Here's how the pattern matches:

- ""zup wif lug dax"" corresponds to ""yellow red blue green.""
- ""zup dax wif"" corresponds to ""yellow green red.""
- ""dax"" on its own corresponds to ""green.""
- ""zup dax"" corresponds to ""yellow green.""
- ""dax lug walm"" corresponds to ""green blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" seems to also correspond to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" seems to repeat the color ""blue.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,24,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's correlate each instance of ""dax"" in the input with its corresponding output:

2. Input: zup dax wif | Output: yellow green red
3. Input: dax | Output: green
4. Input: zup dax | Output: yellow green
5. Input: dax lug walm | Output: green blue blue blue

From the above examples, it's clear that every time ""dax"" appears, the color ""green"" appears in the corresponding output.

- In example 1, ""dax"" appears at the end, and ""green"" is the last color.
- In example 2, ""dax"" is between ""zup"" and ""wif"", and ""green"" is between ""yellow"" and ""red"".
- In example 3, ""dax"" is the only word, and ""green"" is the only color in the output.
- In example 4, ""dax"" is after ""zup,"" and ""green"" follows ""yellow"".
- In example 5, ""dax"" is before ""lug walm,"" and ""green"" precedes ""blue blue blue"".

This consistency across all examples strongly suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,24,dax
"Based on the examples provided and looking for patterns, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" This is demonstrated by the consistency of the output when ""wif"" is used in various positions within the input series, always resulting in ""red"" regardless of its position or the other words around it. 

Therefore, the rule for the word ""wif"" is as follows:

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". In every instance where ""wif"" is present, the output includes the color ""red"". Additionally, when ""wif"" appears alone as an input, the output is simply ""red"".

"Observing the patterns where the word ""walm"" appears in the inputs and the corresponding outputs, it's clear that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color that comes right before it. Here's how the rule works based on the given examples:

1. ""lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" ""Zup"" comes before ""walm"" and translates to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated three times before the next color occurs.

2. ""lug wif walm"" translates to ""blue red red red."" ""Wif"" comes before ""walm"" and translates to ""red"", so ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times.

3. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green."" ""Dax"" comes before ""walm"" and translates to ""green"", so ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated three times.

4. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue red green."" ""Lug"" comes before ""walm"" and translates to ""blue,"" so ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times before proceeding with the next colors in sequence.

Based on this pattern, ""walm"" causes the color word that precedes it to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> ""Repeat the preceding color three times.""",1.0,24,walm
"The examples given suggest that ""walm"" acts as a rule for duplicating the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it multiple times. Each occurrence of ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word right before ""walm,"" equal in number to the position of ""walm"" within the sequence.

To illustrate this, let's examine the examples closely:

1. In ""lug zup walm lug,"" ""walm"" is the third word. ""Zup"" corresponds to yellow, so the output is ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" ""Walm"" resulted in three yellows ('yellow' being the color for 'zup') because it was the third word.

2. In ""lug wif walm,"" ""walm"" is the third word again. ""Wif"" corresponds to red, so the output is ""blue red red red."" There are three reds because ""walm"" was the third word.

3. In ""dax walm,"" ""walm"" is the second word. ""Dax"" corresponds to green, so the output is ""green green green."" There are two additional greens because ""walm"" was the second word, hence, repeated twice.

4. In ""zup lug walm wif dax,"" ""walm"" is the fourth word. ""Lug"" corresponds to blue, and since ""walm"" is the fourth word, the output includes ""blue blue blue blue"" after the initial ""yellow blue.""

Therefore, ""walm"" duplicates the color linked with the preceding word, with the count of duplication based on the positional order of ""walm"" in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" means repeating the color associated with the word before ""walm"" as many times as the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.",1.0,24,walm
"Rule: walm seems to mean repeating the color of the last mentioned color word before it. 

Explanation: In each instance, the word ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word just before it.

- In the first example, ""lug zup walm lug,"" the word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" followed by ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" After ""walm,"" the color ""yellow"" is repeated three times, indicating that it means to repeat the color ""yellow"" that comes from ""zup.""
  
- Similarly, in the second instance, despite being the same as the first, it confirms that ""walm"" causes the color that precedes it to repeat (""lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"").

- In the third example, ""lug wif walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" After ""walm,"" the color ""red"" is repeated thrice, showcasing the same behavior as before with ""walm.""

- In the fourth example, ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and post ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated twice.

- Lastly, in the ""zup lug walm wif dax"" example, after ""lug"" (which is ""blue""), ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times until another color word is encountered.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,25,dax
Rule: dax -> green,1.0,25,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we will look for a pattern that associates the word ""dax"" with the colors in the output. 

From the first input ""dax bluf lug wif"" that produces the output ""green green blue red"", we see that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Each subsequent input that contains ""dax"" yields ""green"" in the corresponding output:

- Input: ""dax"" -> Output: ""green""
- Input: ""wif lug dax walm"" -> Output: ""red blue green green green"" (3rd position corresponds to ""dax"")
- Input: ""dax lug walm zup wif"" -> Output: ""green blue blue blue yellow red"" (""dax"" is first and corresponds to ""green"")
- Input: ""lug dax"" -> Output: ""blue green"" (2nd position is ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"")

The common pattern is that whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" is in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,25,dax
Rule: dax -> green,1.0,25,dax
Rule: dax -> green,1.0,25,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we need to analyze the occurrences of ""wif"" in the examples and their corresponding outputs.

In the examples, we notice:

- When ""wif"" is present, the color ""red"" always appears in the output.
- ""wif"" does not have a fixed position in the input sequence, yet ""red"" consistently appears.
- The number of times ""red"" appears is not directly tied to the position of ""wif"" within the input.
- The other words in the input (""bluf,"" ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""walm,"" ""lug"") result in different colors in the output (""red,"" ""green,"" ""yellow,"" ""blue"").
- No other word in the inputs consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output; ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" in some cases but not always.

From this information, we can deduce that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. The rule is consistent across all examples, regardless of ""wif"" position or other words present.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,25,wif
"Based on the provided examples, each instance of ""wif"" correlates with the output ""red.""

- In example one, ""wif bluf dax walm,"" the output is ""red red green green green."" Since ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red,"" it can be deduced that ""wif"" equals ""red.""
- In example two, ""zup bluf wif,"" the output is ""yellow yellow red."" We know ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" to ""red,"" but here ""bluf"" precedes ""wif"" and the output changes from previous appearances, which implies a positional variation in the output. Even so, ""wif"" leads to ""red.""
- In the third example, ""zup wif walm,"" another red appears directly after ""wif,"" while ""zup"" still translates to ""yellow"" and the presence of ""walm"" correlates to multiple greens, but in this sequence, it is reds instead. This again supports that ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
- In example four, ""dax lug wif bluf,"" we see ""green blue red red"" as the output. Here, ""dax"" is green, ""lug"" apparently is blue, and once again ""wif"" corresponds to red, consistent with prior examples.
- Lastly, in example five, ""zup wif,"" the output is ""yellow red,"" and once again ""wif"" aligns with ""red.""

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red.",1.0,25,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the given input-output pairs and the pattern of colors associated with each word:

1. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
2. zup bluf wif -> yellow yellow red
3. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
4. dax lug wif bluf -> green blue red red
5. zup wif -> yellow red

Here are the observations:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in every instance.
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" when it appears with ""wif"" and ""green"" without ""wif"".
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" regardless of the presence of ""wif"".
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" without ""wif"" and ""red"" when with ""wif"".
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

Given that ""wif"" correlates with ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence, we can deduce that ""wif"" is directly associated with the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,25,wif
"Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" seems to be associated with the color red in the output. Each time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word red appears in the output at the corresponding position. Therefore, it is reasonable to deduce that ""wif"" means red in these examples.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,25,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"":

- In the first input, ""bluf dax"" correlates with ""red green"" and when ""wif"" appears before ""walm,"" the output is a repetition of the color ""green.""
- In the second and fourth inputs, ""bluf"" directly correlates with ""red,"" so it seems ""wif"" does not affect the color associated with ""bluf.""
- In the third example, ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" and when ""wif"" appears before ""walm,"" the color ""red"" is repeated as in the first example.
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""wif"" following ""zup"" correlates with ""red.""

From these observations, it appears ""wif"" might indicate a repeating of the color that follows it (as shown with ""walm"" -> ""green green green"" and ""bluf"" -> ""red red""). However, when ""wif"" stands alone (as in the last example), it correlates with ""red.""

Rule: wif -> causes the next color word to repeat or, if no color word follows, represents the color red.",0.8,25,wif
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,25,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that 'zup' consistently correlates with the output 'yellow,' regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of 'zup' can be derived as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,25,zup
"Based on the examples given, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow each time it is used.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,25,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,25,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,25,zup
"bluf -> repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it. Rule: If a word is followed by ""bluf,"" the color corresponding to the preceding word is repeated in the output for ""bluf.""",1.0,25,bluf
"bluf -> ""repeats the color of the immediately preceding word."" Rule: If the word immediately before ""bluf"" is associated with a particular color, then ""bluf"" takes on that color. If ""bluf"" is the first word or if no color has been established by the previous word, then ""bluf"" is red by default.

Justifications:
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is green, suggesting ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""bluf"" repeats it.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is yellow, suggesting ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""bluf"" repeats it.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is red, suggesting ""wif"" corresponds to red and ""bluf"" repeats it.
- When ""bluf"" is directly after ""lug,"" the output is blue, hence ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""bluf"" repeats it.
- In ""wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" is red, indicating that when there's no established color, ""bluf"" defaults to red.",1.0,25,bluf
"Rule:

Based on the examples given, bluf seems to correspond to the color ""yellow"" when it follows certain words and ""green"" when it follows other words. Specifically:

- Bluf is ""yellow"" when it follows zup.
- Bluf is ""green"" when it follows dax.
- Bluf is ""red"" when it follows wif.
  
From the provided examples, it is not entirely clear what bluf means when it follows different words, such as lug, because it is not directly followed by bluf in any of the examples. However, in the context of 'lug bluf', bluf corresponds to ""blue"", but this might be a rule specific to the sequence of lug followed by bluf, or it might be coincidental based on the limited examples.

Given the information we have, the general rule seems to be that bluf's meaning changes depending on the word that precedes it, suggesting that bluf's meaning is context-dependent.

Therefore, the rule for bluf's meaning can be expressed as:

bluf -> meaning changes depending on the preceding word:
- After ""zup"": yellow
- After ""dax"": green
- After ""wif"": red",1.0,25,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to correlate with the color that would follow it if it were not nonce. It seems to be a placeholder for the next color word and it repeats the color of the word that is next to it in sequence. The first instance of ""bluf"" takes the color of the word preceding it, while the second and subsequent instances of ""bluf"" take the color of the word following them. Here is the breakdown:

1. In ""dax zup bluf,"" ""bluf"" takes the color of the word after it, which is yellow.
2. In ""zup dax bluf,"" ""bluf"" takes the color of the word after it, which is green.
3. In ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug,"" there are two instances of ""bluf"":
   - The first ""bluf"" takes the color of the word after it, which is red.
   - The second ""bluf"" takes the color of the word after it, which is blue.
4. In ""wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" takes the color of the word before it because there is no word after it, which is red.
5. In ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif,"" there are two instances of ""bluf"":
   - The first ""bluf"" takes the color of the word after it, which is yellow.
   - The second ""bluf"" again takes the color of the word after it, which is red.

"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""yellow."" The word that precedes ""bluf"" determines the color that comes just before the yellow. If ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color is ""green,"" if ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color is ""yellow,"" and if ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color is ""red."" If ""bluf"" is at the beginning of the sequence or follows another ""bluf,"" it remains ""yellow.""",0.0,25,bluf
"By examining the input and output pairs provided, it becomes clear that the presence of ""walm"" in the input corresponds to the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word in the input three times in the output.

1. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" - ""lug"" is associated with blue, and ""walm"" causes it to repeat three times.
2. ""wif walm dax zup"" results in ""red red red green yellow"" - Here, ""wif"" is associated with red, ""walm"" causes red to repeat three times, ""dax"" is associated with green and ""zup"" with yellow.
3. ""zup lug walm"" outputs ""yellow blue blue blue"" - ""zup"" is yellow, ""lug"" is blue, and ""walm"" causes blue to repeat three times.
4. ""dax walm zup walm"" outputs ""green green green yellow yellow yellow"" - Here ""dax"" is green, ""walm"" causes green to repeat three times, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""walm"" causes yellow to repeat three times.
5. ""dax walm wif"" results in ""green green green red"" - ""dax"" is associated with green, ""walm"" causes green to repeat three times, followed by ""wif"" which is red.

Based on these observations, we can induce the rule that ""walm"" after a word causes the color associated with that word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,25,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the color that is associated with the word that comes immediately before it. Specifically, ""walm"" causes the color word associated with the preceding word to repeat three times.

Here's the breakdown according to the examples:

1. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" - so ""lug"" results in ""blue"" and ""walm"" causes it to repeat three times.
2. ""wif walm dax zup"" gives ""red red red green yellow"" - ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" followed by ""walm"" causing ""red"" to repeat three times, then ""dax"" is followed by ""green,"" and ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow.""
3. ""zup lug walm"" results in ""yellow blue blue blue"" - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to repeat three times.
4. ""dax walm zup walm"" results in ""green green green yellow yellow yellow"" - ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" and ""walm"" causes it to repeat three times. Then ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" and the second ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to repeat three times.
5. ""dax walm wif"" gives ""green green green red"" - ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" ""walm"" causes ""green"" to repeat three times, and ""wif"" correlates with ""red.""

So the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color word that corresponds to the word immediately before it to repeat three times.",1.0,25,walm
walm -> rule. Rule: repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.,1.0,25,walm
"walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the word before walm.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, the output is the color associated with the preceding word repeated three times.",1.0,25,walm
"Based on the given examples, when the word ""walm"" is used in an input, the output consists of repeats of the color corresponding to the word that precedes ""walm,"" with the number of repetitions being three (except for the final example, where an additional rule might apply since there are only three repetitions even though two instances of ""walm"" were presented, possibly due to the input ending with ""walm""). Each instance of ""walm"" is followed by colors corresponding to any word following ""walm"", if applicable (except for the case when ""walm"" is at the end of the input, as seen in the final example).

So, the rule for the word ""walm"" seems to be: ""Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding 'walm' three times.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",0.8,25,walm
"lug -> blue

"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""dax"" translates to a specific color in the output. Here's the pattern observed:

- When ""dax"" is present in the input, ""green"" always appears in the corresponding output.
- The position of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to the position of ""green"" in the output.
- Other words in the input correspond to other specific colors (e.g., ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"").

From these observations, the rule seems to be that ""dax"" is associated with the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,26,dax
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the output produces a specific color for each input word except for the word ""dax."" The color output for ""dax"" seems to depend on its position within the input sequence. It does not consistently correspond to one particular color but instead takes on the color indicated by the position it occupies in the sequence.

Here's the observation from the given examples:

1. ""dax"" in the 1st position results in ""green""
2. ""dax"" in the 2nd position results in ""green""
3. ""dax"" in the 3rd position results in ""green""
4. ""dax"" in the 4th position results in ""green""
5. ""dax"" in the 5th position is unknown (not provided)

Based on this, the rule for ""dax"" would be as follows:

dax -> The color green is output regardless of the position ""dax"" is in the sequence.

Rule: dax always results in the color ""green"" when it appears in the input sequence, independent of its position.",1.0,26,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" causes the output color to change according to the following rule:

- If ""dax"" proceeds a word, the color of the word that comes after ""dax"" is changed to green.
- If ""dax"" does not proceed a word, it does not change the color of any word, and its own color is green.

Let's apply this rule to each input example to see if the rule holds:

1. Input: dax walm wif
- According to our rule, ""walm"" should be green because it comes directly after ""dax"". The word ""wif"" is not directly after a ""dax"", so it doesn't turn green, and its default color is red.

Output: green green green red

2. Input: dax walm
- The word ""walm"" comes right after ""dax"" and should be green.

Output: green green green

3. Input: wif walm dax zup
- None of the words before ""dax"" change color because of ""dax"". The word ""zup"" comes right after ""dax"" and turns green.

Output: red red red green yellow

4. Input: lug bluf dax lug
- ""Lug"" comes right after ""dax"" and turns green; all other colors remain unchanged.

Output: blue blue green blue

5. Input: zup dax wif zup
- ""Wif"" comes right after ""dax"" and turns green; all other colors remain unchanged.

Output: yellow green red yellow

The rule seems consistent with all given examples. Therefore:

dax -> causes the subsequent word's color to be green when directly followed. Otherwise, ""dax"" remains green itself.
Rule: If ""dax"" is directly before a word, that word turns green; if ""dax"" stands alone or is not directly before a word, ""dax"" is green.",1.0,26,dax
"Observing the provided examples, a consistent pattern emerges with respect to the word ""dax"" and the colors associated with it. Here's what we notice:

1. When ""dax"" is in the first position, the corresponding color is green:
   - ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green green green red""
   - ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""

2. When ""dax"" is not the first word, it still corresponds to the color green:
   - ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow""
   - ""lug bluf dax lug"" -> ""blue blue green blue""
   - ""zup dax wif zup"" -> ""yellow green red yellow""

Based on these observations, it appears that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,26,dax
"From the examples provided, it seems that the word ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green"". It does not matter where ""dax"" appears in the sequence of words, the output is consistently ""green"" when ""dax"" is present.

"zup -> meaning. The meaning of ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the output contains the color yellow at the corresponding position.",1.0,26,zup
"Based on the examples, it appears that ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow."" The word ""zup"" results in the word ""yellow"" being outputted each time it appears. Here is the inductions from the given examples:

- In the first example, ""zup"" is followed by ""green yellow,"" but since ""wif walm dax"" corresponds to ""red red red,"" ""zup"" can be isolated as relating to ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" appears at the beginning and is followed by ""yellow,"" which reinforces the association of ""zup"" with the color ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""zup"" appears twice, once at the beginning and once in the middle, and both times it is followed by ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, every instance of ""lug walm"" corresponds with ""blue blue blue,"" and the ""zup"" inserted in the middle corresponds with ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue"" both before and after ""zup,"" which corresponds with ""yellow.""

Thus, the pattern that emerges from these examples is that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" The rule can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,26,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer that the word ""zup"" causes the output to change from the default pattern to ""yellow."" In each case, regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence, the word that corresponds to ""zup"" in the output is ""yellow."" The rest of the words seem to follow a consistent pattern where ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" ""walm"" also maps to ""red,"" ""bluf"" maps to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" maps to ""blue.""

Here is the rule based on the examples:

- ""wif"" -> red
- ""walm"" -> red
- ""bluf"" -> yellow
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""zup"" -> yellow (regardless of its position in the sequence)

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,26,zup
"To deduce the rules for the nonce word ""zup"", let's look closely at each instance and its corresponding output:

1. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
2. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
3. zup bluf lug zup -> yellow yellow blue yellow
4. lug walm zup lug walm -> blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
5. lug zup lug -> blue yellow blue

In all instances above, ""zup"" is associated with a color change in the output sequence. Specifically, when ""zup"" appears, the color sequence includes a ""yellow"" at the position where ""zup"" is in the input sequence. Additionally, in examples 1, 3, and 4, the appearance of ""zup"" is followed by another color that hasn't appeared immediately before it: green in the first instance, and yellow again in the third and fourth instances, assuming that the repetition of yellow in the output of the third and fourth examples still counts as a change because it's a response to another ""zup.""

Based on these observations, we can infer a rule:

Rule: zup indicates a change to the color yellow at its position in the sequence.

Hence, the meaning of ""zup"" in the context of the examples provided appears to be a command that results in the color yellow in the output sequence.

zup -> meaning. Rule: When ""zup"" appears in an input sequence, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output sequence.",1.0,26,zup
"From the examples provided, it appears that the word ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow."" Every time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output. The other words in the input are consistently translated to the same colors in the output:

- ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red""
- ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""

There is no instance where ""zup"" leads to any output other than ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,26,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the rule governing the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" through comparison.

In the first example:
Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
The word ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the corresponding output is ""red red"". Here, the appearance of ""bluf"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the previous word.

In the second example:
Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green
""Bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the corresponding output is ""green green"". Again, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word that precedes it.

In the third example:
Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax
Output: green green yellow yellow green
Each occurrence of ""bluf"" is followed by a color that repeats the color linked to the word before it.

In the fourth example, the input-output pattern is identical to the second example and doesn't provide any new information about the rule.

The fifth example:
Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
Output: yellow yellow red blue green
Here, the pattern holds as ""bluf"" after ""zup"" becomes ""yellow yellow"", once again repeating the color associated with the preceding word (zup -> yellow). 

Bluf -> meaning. Rule:
The rule seems to be that ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the previous word in the sequence. If the previous word outputs ""red"", ""bluf"" will result in another ""red"". If the previous word outputs ""yellow"", ""bluf"" will produce another ""yellow"", and so on.",1.0,26,bluf
"Rule: ""bluf"" -> repeat the color of the previous word. 

This is evident from the given examples:

- In ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" repeats this color, also leading to ""red.""
- In ""zup dax bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""bluf"" repeats ""green.""
- In ""dax bluf zup bluf dax,"" after the first ""dax"" which is ""green,"" ""bluf"" repeats ""green."" Following ""zup"" which is ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" again repeats the color ""yellow,"" and the pattern continues.
- In ""zup dax bluf,"" it's the same rule as the second example.
- In ""zup bluf wif lug dax,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" so the first ""bluf"" repeats ""yellow."" After ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" there's no ""bluf,"" but ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and the final ""dax"" is ""green.""

Based on the examples, the rule holds consistently. It's important to note that ""bluf"" depends on the color associated with the word that directly precedes it.",1.0,26,bluf
"Observing each instance where the word ""bluf"" appears, one can deduce the following pattern:

1. In the first example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red."" Since ""wif"" does not appear in the output, one can assume that ""bluf"" stands for ""red"" in this context.

2. In the second example, ""zup dax bluf"" translates to ""yellow green green"". Here, ""zup"" seems to correlate with ""yellow,"" ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" and given the previous example where ""bluf"" relates to ""red,"" it's not consistent. It now appears that ""bluf"" results in the color that precedes it, which is ""green"" in this case.

3. In the third example, ""dax bluf zup bluf dax"" translates to ""green green yellow yellow green"". Here, ""dax"" is consistently translating to ""green,"" and each occurrence of ""bluf"" results in the color that precedes it (""green"" before the first ""bluf"" and ""yellow"" before the second ""bluf"").

4. The fourth example is the same as the second and yields the same translation, reinforcing the observations from the second example.

5. In the fifth example, ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow red blue green"". Here, the word ""bluf"" is following ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" translates again to ""yellow."" ""Lug"" is introduced and corresponds to ""blue.""

Based on the examples, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it translates to the color word that immediately precedes it. If there is no color word before ""bluf"", there is not enough data to determine the output based on the given examples.

Rule: bluf -> The word ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word. If the preceding word is a color name, ""bluf"" assumes that color's name in the output. If the preceding word is not a color name or there is no preceding word, the rule for ""bluf"" is indeterminate based on the given data.",0.8,26,bluf

From these examples, we can extract the following observations:

- Whenever ""bluf"" follows another word, the output contains the color corresponding to the word preceding ""bluf"" twice. This pattern is seen in examples 1 and 2 where ""wif bluf"" and ""dax bluf"" result in ""red red"" and ""green green,"" respectively.
- In example 3, ""dax bluf"" and ""zup bluf"" result in ""green green"" and ""yellow yellow,"" respectively, which further confirms that ""bluf"" doubles the color of the word before it.
- Example 5 is more complex but follows the same rule since ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

bluf -> Doubles the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a word, the output contains the color associated with the preceding word, repeated twice.",0.8,26,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or rule for ""bluf"", we analyze the input-output pairs:

1. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
2. Input: zup dax bluf -> Output: yellow green green
3. Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax -> Output: green green yellow yellow green
4. Input: zup dax bluf -> Output: yellow green green
5. Input: zup bluf wif lug dax -> Output: yellow yellow red blue green

A pattern seems to emerge when we look at the input before ""bluf"" and its corresponding output:

- When ""wif"" is before ""bluf"", the output is ""red red"". The word preceding ""bluf"" is repeated in the output.
- When ""zup"" is before ""bluf"", the output is ""yellow green"" and not just yellow, which may indicate that ""bluf"" is associated with both ""yellow"" and ""green"".
- When ""dax"" is before ""bluf"", the output is ""green green"", which indicates that ""bluf"" is associated with a repetition of the color linked to the preceding word, in this case, ""green"".

It appears that the word ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the previous word to repeat. To confirm:

- In the third input, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" then ""zup"" and the output color for each, green and yellow, respectively, is repeated.
- In the fifth input, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output is ""yellow yellow"", denoting the repetition of ""yellow"" which is the color associated with ""zup"".

Rule: bluf -> Causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated in the output.",0.8,26,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" generates a repetition of the color word that precedes it. The number of repetitions is three times. Let's look at the examples:

- Input: lug walm wif lug bluf -> Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
  Given that ""lug"" signals ""blue,"" when followed by ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times; ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""bluf"" has no impact on the rule for ""walm.""

- Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue
  ""Dax"" stands for ""green,"" and ""lug"" for ""blue."" When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times.

- Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
  ""Zup"" represents ""yellow,"" and followed by ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

- Input: lug zup dax walm -> Output: blue yellow green green green
  ""Lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""dax"" represent ""blue,"" ""yellow,"" and ""green,"" respectively. ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" and therefore ""green"" is repeated three times.

- Input: dax walm wif -> Output: green green green red
  ""Dax"" stands for ""green,"" so followed by ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated three times; ""wif"" stands for ""red"" and is not related to the rule for ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times.",1.0,26,walm
"walm -> rule: Repeat the previous color three times.

Rule:
- In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" leading to three blues. ""wif"" corresponds to red, altering the sequence with a single instance.
- In the second example, ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""lug"" to blue, hence ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in three blues.
- In the third example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" follows, yielding three yellows.
- In the fourth example, each color is represented by ""lug"" (blue), ""zup"" (yellow) and ""dax"" (green) with ""walm"" following ""dax,"" leading to three greens.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) and precedes ""wif"" (red), so ""walm"" translates into three greens followed by a red. 

Therefore, ""walm"" induces the repetition of the color word that precedes it three times.",1.0,26,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" generates a repetition of the color word that directly precedes it three times. Here is how each example leads to this conclusion:

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Here, 'lug' translates to 'blue', then 'walm' is followed by three 'blue' before 'wif' switches the pattern to 'red', and 'bluf' ends it with another 'blue'. The nonce word walm caused 'blue' to be repeated three times.

Input: dax lug walm
'Dax' is 'green', 'lug' is 'blue', followed by walm which repeats 'blue' three times.

Input: zup walm
'Zup' is 'yellow', followed by walm which repeats 'yellow' three times.

Input: lug zup dax walm
'Lug' is 'blue', 'zup' is 'yellow', 'dax' is 'green', and walm repeats 'green' three times.

Input: dax walm wif
'Dax' is 'green', 'walm' repeats 'green' three times, and then 'wif' translates to 'red'.

From this, we can deduce:

walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color word immediately before it to be repeated three times.",1.0,26,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the output in each case where ""walm"" is a part of the input:

1. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   - The sequence ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" might mean repetition of the color associated with ""lug,"" which is blue.

2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - Here, ""lug walm"" again results in repeated blue after a green associated with ""dax.""

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" on its own would be represented by yellow, and with ""walm,"" it leads to triple yellow.

4. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green
   - Following the previous pattern, ""dax walm"" here results in repeated greens which are associated with ""dax.""

5. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   - ""dax walm"" gives us repeated green, confirming the replication pattern, and ""wif"" is consistently associated with red.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times.

Thus:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: causes the color represented by the preceding word to be repeated three times.",0.9,26,walm
"Rule: walm -> ""repeat the color corresponding to the previous word the number of times the first letter of the previous word occurs in the alphabet.""

Let's break down the examples to identify the pattern for ""walm"":

1. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   Rule Application: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". The letter 'l' is the 12th letter of the alphabet, thus ""walm"" after ""lug"" yields ""blue"" repeated 12 times. However, only three repetitions are shown before the sequence is interrupted by ""wif"", which represents ""red"".

2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Rule Application: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". The letter 'l' is the 12th letter of the alphabet, therefore ""walm"" yields ""blue"" repeated 12 times. We see three of the repetitions.

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Rule Application: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". The letter 'z' is the 26th letter of the alphabet, yet we only see ""yellow"" repeated 3 times, which likely means there is a limit on the number of repetitions shown in the output.

4. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green
   Rule Application: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". The letter 'd' is the 4th letter of the alphabet, so ""walm"" yields ""green"" repeated 4 times, and all repetitions are shown.

5. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   Rule Application: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". The letter 'd' is the 4th letter of the alphabet, so ""walm"" yields ""green"" repeated 4 times, and we see all or part of these repetitions before the sequence ends with ""wif"" for ""red"".

Given the evidence provided, the definition or rule for walm seems to be based on repeating the color that corresponds to the word prior to ""walm"", a number of times equal to the alphabet position of that preceding word's first letter. There is also likely a cap or limit on the number of repetitions, which prevents us from seeing a full 12 or 26 repetitions in the output. The last color word that interrupts the sequence is seemingly unrelated to ""walm"" and follows its own rule.

walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word based on the position in the alphabet of the first letter of that word, with a cap on the maximum repetition displayed.",0.9,26,walm
"lug -> blue. Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.",1.0,27,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,27,lug

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"".",1.0,27,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears as input, the corresponding output is ""blue"".",1.0,27,lug
"Based on the provided input and output pairs, the nonce word ""lug"" translates consistently to the color ""blue"" no matter its position within the input sequence. Whether ""lug"" appears at the beginning, middle, or end of the input, the output always includes the color blue in the corresponding position.

Therefore, we define the rule as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,27,lug
"dax -> green

Rule: Each unique word translates to a unique color. ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence. ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" to ""red,"" ""wif"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" These mappings remain consistent across different examples.",1.0,27,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer that ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green."" Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, a ""green"" appears in the output. We do not have enough information to determine if ""dax"" has further functions or meanings beyond this color association, as the examples provided only correlate ""dax"" with ""green.""

Therefore, the inferred rule is:

Rule: dax -> green

Meaning: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.",1.0,27,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to pertain to the colors associated with each nonce word. The output is a series of colors that correspond to the input nonce words. The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green."" Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, regardless of its position, the output consistently includes the color ""green.""

The inputs and corresponding outputs suggest that each unique nonce word is assigned a specific color:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> red
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue

Notably, the repeated appearance of ""walm"" in the second example translates to the color ""red"" being repeated three times, indicating a one-to-one correspondence between each instance of a nonce word and its color.

The rule inferred from the examples is:

Rule: Each nonce word is matched to a specific color in the output, and the word ""dax"" always means ""green.""",1.0,27,dax
"Based on the given examples, it seems that each nonce word corresponds to a particular color. The word ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green."" Therefore, we can deduce that the meaning of the word ""dax"" in this context is the color green.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,27,dax
"Through the analysis of the provided examples, the following observations can be made:

1. Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" is in the corresponding output.
2. ""dax"" does not modify the output of other words following or preceding it, as can be seen by the fact that the other words in the input produce consistent outputs regardless of the position of ""dax"".

From these observations, we can infer that ""dax"" is associated with the color green, and it does not have a contextual or position-dependent meaning. Thus, in this context, the most straightforward interpretation is that ""dax"" translates directly to the color ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,27,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that words are being translated into colors. Notably, ""wif"" appears to correspond to the color red.

Here is the evidence leading to this conclusion:

- In the first input, ""wif"" is the third word and corresponds to the third color in the output, which is red.
- In the second input, ""wif"" is the second word and corresponds to the second color in the output, which is red.
- In the third input, ""wif"" is the sixth word and corresponds to the sixth color in the output, which is red.
- In the fourth input, ""wif"" is the first and the only word (repeated twice), and the output is ""red red,"" indicating that both instances of ""wif"" translate to red.
- In the fifth input, ""wif"" is the first word, and the output starts with red, further supporting that ""wif"" corresponds to red.

Input: lug wif bluf -> Output: blue red red
Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
Input: wif walm -> Output: red red red
Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red

Analyzing the input-output pairs, the simplest consistent rule is that ""wif"" translates to ""red"".

Thus, the rule is: wif -> red",1.0,27,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" translates to the color red. Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding output. To clarify:

- In the first example, ""lug zup wif"" translates to ""blue yellow red,"" with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red"".
- In the second example, ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red."" The second ""red"" is paired with ""bluf,"" but the first ""red"" follows ""wif.""
- In the third example, with multiple color words in the input, ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red.""

- lug wif bluf -> blue red red

- ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red"": ""bluf"" causes ""red"" (the output for ""wif"") to be repeated.
- ""zup bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow"": ""bluf"" causes ""yellow"" (the output for ""zup"") to be repeated.
- ""dax bluf wif zup"" outputs ""green green red yellow"": ""bluf"" causes ""green"" (the output for ""dax"") to be repeated, and then the outputs for ""wif"" and ""zup"" follow as usual.
- ""lug wif bluf"" outputs ""blue red red"": ""bluf"" causes ""red"" (the output for ""wif"") to be repeated, preceding outputs are unaffected.
- ""dax bluf lug wif"" outputs ""green green blue red"": ""bluf"" causes ""green"" (the output for ""dax"") to be repeated, and then the outputs for ""lug"" and ""wif"" follow as usual.

Rule: bluf -> causes the output of the immediately preceding word to be repeated.",1.0,27,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Let's look at the examples to deduce the rule:

1. In ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""red red,"" which means ""bluf"" causes the preceding color (red) to be repeated.
   
2. In ""zup bluf,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow yellow,"" confirming the rule that ""bluf"" repeats the preceding color (yellow).

3. In ""dax bluf wif zup,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" leading to the output ""green green."" Following this, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" then ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" without any additional instances of ""bluf,"" and the colors are simply listed as their associated outputs.

4. In ""lug wif bluf,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" causes the output to be ""red red,"" again repeating the color associated with the word right before ""bluf"" (red).

5. Finally, in ""dax bluf lug wif,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" follows it, resulting in ""green green."" Then ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" followed by ""wif"" with ""red."" Since ""bluf"" does not reoccur, there is no further color repetition.

"Rule: bluf -> repeat the color that corresponds to the previous word.

""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""zup bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow.""

"walm -> meaning.

To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the input and output to understand the relationship. Let's analyze the commonalities when ""walm"" appears.

4. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
5. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green

Looking at the examples:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears, it causes the following word to repeat the color of the previous word. For example, in the first input, ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" and when ""walm"" follows, ""zup"" also translates into ""blue.""

- This rule is consistent across all other examples.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word.",1.0,27,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word 'walm' causes the following color to repeat the same number of times as the color that immediately precedes it. Here's the deduction from the examples given:

Example 1: ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red"". Here, 'lug' represents blue and after 'walm' blue is repeated twice more, making three consecutive blues in total.

Example 2: ""wif walm dax"" translates to ""red red red green"". Here, 'wif' represents red and after 'walm' red is repeated twice more, making three consecutive reds in total.

Example 3: ""wif lug dax walm"" translates to ""red blue green green green"". 'Dax' represents green and after 'walm', green is repeated twice more, making three consecutive greens in total.

Example 4: ""dax walm wif walm zup"" translates to ""green green green red red red yellow"". 'Dax' represents green, which is repeated twice more after the first 'walm'. Then 'wif' represents red, and after the second 'walm', red is repeated twice more.

Example 5: ""lug walm dax"" translates to ""blue blue blue green"". 'Lug' represents blue and is repeated twice more after 'walm'.

Thus, the rule for 'walm' seems to be that it indicates the next word should be repeated the same number of times as the last word before 'walm'.

2. Additionally, when ""walm"" is present, it does not seem to have a color associated with it directly, but rather affects the following word. Therefore, ""walm"" does not directly translate to a color, but to an instruction to repeat.

- Input: lug walm dax

Since ""dax"" appears in each input and the word ""green"" appears in each corresponding output, we can infer that ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green"".

Therefore, the rule we can infer for ""dax"" is:

dax -> green

This means that regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence or the presence and position of other words, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output.

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Regardless of the other words present in the inputs, each time ""dax"" appears, the output includes ""green.""

So the rule appears to be quite straightforward:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in the output.",1.0,28,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" correlates consistently with the output ""green."" The input ""dax"" on its own produces the output ""green,"" and when ""dax"" is included with other words, ""green"" is always part of the output sequence. The other words in the examples appear to map to other colors, but there is not enough information to deduce the exact rule for those. However, for the word ""dax,"" we can deduce the following:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,28,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""wif"" is a function that translates the following word into a corresponding color. Each word after ""wif"" is mapped to a specific color:

- dax -> green
- bluf -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow

Given that the output color directly follows the nonce word ""wif"" and the pattern is consistent across multiple examples, we can infer that ""wif"" acts as a translator or marker indicating that the next word will be translated into a specific color.

Rule: wif -> precedes a word that corresponds to a color, acting as the indicator for the translation from nonce word to color.",1.0,28,wif
"Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" acts as a marker for a color change in the following sequence:

- ""wif"" followed by ""dax"" leads to the color red followed by green.
- ""wif"" followed by ""lug"" leads to the color red followed by blue.
- ""wif"" followed by ""zup"" leads to the color red followed by yellow.

Therefore, every time ""wif"" is mentioned, it corresponds to the color red, and depending on the word that follows ""wif"", the subsequent color is determined. The word after ""wif"" directly correlates with a specific color: ""dax"" correlates with green, ""lug"" with blue, and ""zup"" with yellow.

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color red and indicates that the following word will specify the next color in the sequence.",1.0,28,wif
"Rule: wif -> red. 

Each instance of the word 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red'. The other words following 'wif' correspond to different colors which do not seem to be influenced by the presence of 'wif'.",1.0,28,wif

"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's examine each example and the corresponding output:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""dax,"" the output is ""red green.""
- When ""wif"" stands alone before ""lug,"" the output is ""red blue.""
- Without any additional context, ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is followed by random words such as ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" or ""zup,"" it seems that each of these words corresponds to a different color.

Given these observations, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" while each subsequent word represents individual colors that follow a set pattern not fully determined within the scope of the provided examples.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,28,wif
"Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in each instance. When ""zup"" is combined with other nonce words, each of these words is translated to a corresponding color. The pattern indicates that:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

When ""zup"" appears alone, the output is only ""yellow"", which supports the idea that ""zup"" is consistently associated with the color yellow regardless of context.

For inputs that include words other than 'zup', those words correspond to other colors in the output:

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color yellow regardless of its position in the input string.",1.0,28,zup
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at each example in sequence while comparing inputs to outputs.

1. Input: zup wif bluf zup lug → Output: yellow red red yellow blue

    - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
    - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

2. Input: lug zup bluf dax → Output: blue yellow yellow green
    - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

3. Input: dax bluf wif lug zup → Output: green green red blue yellow
    - The sequence of ""dax bluf"" leads to ""green green""

4. Input: dax bluf wif zup dax → Output: green green red yellow green
    - Similarly, the sequence of ""dax bluf"" leads to ""green green""

5. Input: dax bluf → Output: green green
    - Whenever ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green""

Based on examples 3, 4, and 5, where ""dax bluf"" consistently results in ""green green,"" it suggests that ""bluf"" is acting as a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it.

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds with the color ""green.""

Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
Output: yellow red green yellow blue

The word ""zup"" appears to correspond to ""yellow"", as seen by its consistent replacement in the examples. The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Input: lug zup bluf dax
Output: blue yellow green green

Here, ""dax"" at the end of the sequence has been translated as ""green"", suggesting that ""bluf"" might also mean ""green"" because the sequence bluf-dax results in green-green.

Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
Output: green green red blue yellow

""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output is ""green green"", further supporting the rule that ""bluf"" means ""green"".

Input: dax bluf wif zup dax
Output: green green red yellow green

In this case, ""dax"" surrounds ""bluf"" and both instances of ""dax"" are translated as ""green"". ""bluf"" is also represented as ""green"".

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green

Here, the ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"" and the output is ""green green"" which reinforces our previous findings.

Rule:
bluf -> green.",1.0,28,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we can look at the patterns in which it appears in the input and the corresponding output:

1. Input: zup wif bluf zup lug  
   Output: yellow red red yellow blue
   
2. Input: lug zup bluf dax  
   Output: blue yellow yellow green
   
3. Input: dax bluf wif lug zup  
   Output: green green red blue yellow
   
4. Input: dax bluf wif zup dax  
   Output: green green red yellow green

5. Input: dax bluf  
   Output: green green

These inputs and outputs suggest the following patterns:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Now focusing on ""bluf,"" we see that after ""bluf"" is used, the following color is repeated:

1. ""bluf zup"" -> ""red yellow""
2. ""bluf dax"" -> ""yellow green""
3. ""bluf wif"" -> ""green red""
4. ""bluf"" alone at the end results in ""green green""

From these patterns, we can conclude that ""bluf"" causes the color corresponding to the following word to be repeated. When ""bluf"" is the last word, it causes the color of the word before it to repeat.

"Rule: walm -> the repeated word that directly precedes it.

2. Input: dax lug walm

3. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup

   - The first ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red red red.""
   - The second ""walm"" also follows ""wif"" and again the output is ""red red red.""

4. Input: lug walm zup wif

   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the output is ""blue blue blue.""

5. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red red red.""

Looking at the patterns, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word that precedes it three times. Here is the pattern broken down:

- Dax => green
- Wif => red
- Lug => blue

- Here, ""dax"" corresponds to a single ""green"", and ""walm"" seems to cause a repetition of ""green"" 3 times.

Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue

Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup -> Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
- ""wif"" is ""red,"" but when ""walm"" follows it, the output is ""red"" repeated 3 times. ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and is not repeated, while ""lug"" is ""blue"". A second occurrence of ""wif walm"" leads again to ""red"" repeated 3 times.

Input: lug walm zup wif -> Output: blue blue blue yellow red
- ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" makes it repeat 3 times. Then ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""wif"" is ""red"", each appearing once.

Input: wif walm -> Output: red red red
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""walm"" causes it to repeat 3 times.

Rule: ""walm"" -> Causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.",1.0,28,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the consistent pattern in the outputs related to its presence in the inputs.

Looking at the data:

1. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
2. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
3. ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" -> ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow""
4. ""lug walm zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow red""
5. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""

Observing the patterns:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears, the output is a repetition of a color three times.
- The color that is repeated three times seems to depend on the word immediately preceding ""walm"":
  - After ""dax,"" the color is ""green.""
  - After ""lug,"" the color is ""blue.""
  - After ""wif,"" the color is ""red.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to repeat three times.

Rule: When used after a single word, ""walm"" results in the color associated with that word being repeated three times.
- ""walm"" after ""dax"" -> ""green green green""

"Based on the provided examples, we can infer a relationship between the input words and the output colors. Each word seems to correspond to a specific color. Examining the repetition of colors associated with each word and where ""dax"" appears, we can deduce the following:

- In the second example, ""dax"" appears as the second word followed by ""zup wif,"" and the output sequence is ""red green yellow red"". ""wif"" is both the first and last word, and both times it's matched with ""red"". ""dax"" is matched with ""green.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" is the only input and ""green"" is the only output.
- In the fourth example, ""lug dax"" gives ""blue green,"" and ""lug"" has not appeared before, so it is safe to assume ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and we again see ""dax"" corresponding to ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax,"" produces ""red blue blue yellow yellow green."" Previous patterns suggest that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" ""dax"" at the end correlates with ""green"" again.

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output has the color ""green.""
- ""Dax"" does not appear to modify the output for adjacent words, since its presence does not change the color associated with other nonce words; such as ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue,"" regardless of whether ""dax"" is present before or after them.
- ""Dax"" is independent of its position in the input sequence; it always results in ""green"" in the output.
- There are no instances of ""dax"" in combination with other nonce words that would lead us to believe ""dax"" changes meaning in different contexts.

1. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
2. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
3. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
4. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Every time ""walm"" appears in an input, output colors repeat the color of the word that precedes ""walm"", based on the following observations:

- In ""dax zup dax walm"", ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which corresponds to ""green"", so the output after ""walm"" is ""green green"".
- In ""dax walm"", ""walm"" follows ""dax"", so the two outputs after ""walm"" are ""green green"".
- In ""zup wif lug zup walm"", ""walm"" follows ""zup"", so the output after ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow"".
- In ""zup wif walm"", ""walm"" follows ""wif"", so the output after ""walm"" is ""red red red"".
- In ""dax walm zup"", ""walm"" immediately follows ""dax"" and precedes ""zup"". It duplicates the ""green"" corresponding to ""dax"" (yielding ""green green"") and is then followed by ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"".

Thus, the underlying rule seems to be that the word ""walm"" causes the next part of the output to repeat the color code of the word that precedes ""walm"". The repetition occurs as many times as the word ""walm"" itself appears in succession plus one.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word as many times as ""walm"" appears in succession plus one.",1.0,29,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the immediately preceding word as many times as there are letters in the word ""walm"" (which is four).

So, ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in ""green"" being repeated three more times (for a total of four, since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""), and ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" being repeated three more times.",1.0,29,walm
"Examining the input-output pairs, we can attempt to decode what ""walm"" corresponds to in terms of the output color:

- For ""dax zup dax walm,"" the output is ""green yellow green green green."" The word ""walm"" results in two greens.
- For ""dax walm,"" the output is ""green green green."" Again, ""walm"" results in two greens.
- For ""zup wif lug zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""walm"" results in three yellows.
- For ""zup wif walm,"" the output is ""yellow red red red."" Here, ""walm"" seems to be resulting in two additional reds.
- For ""dax walm zup,"" the output is ""green green green yellow."" In this case, ""walm"" results in two greens before the yellow that corresponds to ""zup.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it results in the repetition of the color corresponding to the word that precedes it, such that the number of repetitions is equal to one plus the number of syllables in the word that ""walm"" follows.

Rules deduced:

- ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" after ""dax"" adds two more greens, making it three greens total since ""dax"" has one syllable.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" after ""zup"" with one syllable adds two yellows, making three yellows total.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" after ""wif"" with one syllable adds two reds, making three reds.

Therefore, we can define the rule for ""walm"" as:

walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" extends the color of the preceding word by repeating it a number of times equal to one plus the number of syllables in the preceding word. 

Rule: If a word precedes ""walm,"" output that word's corresponding color once more than the number of syllables in the word.",0.8,29,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the relationship between the inputs and their respective outputs. It appears that each non-walm word corresponds to a specific color:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue

Now, examining the occurrences of ""walm"" in the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can infer the following:

- When ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" an additional green is added for each ""dax"" prior to ""walm.""
- When ""walm"" follows any other word (like ""zup"" or ""wif""), its presence causes that word's corresponding color to repeat one extra time.

Therefore, it seems that the rule for ""walm"" could be that it extends the preceding color by repeating it according to the number of times the preceding word occurs. However, caveat: the rule changes slightly if ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" as ""dax"" itself is also repeated.

Based on the rule we've deduced from the examples, we can define ""walm"" as:
walm -> meaning: Repeats the output color of the word before it, one extra time for each instance of that word prior to ""walm"" in the sequence.

Rule: If the word before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" repeat the color green for each occurrence of ""dax"" before the walm. If the word before ""walm"" is any other word (""zup,"" ""wif,"" or ""lug""), then repeat the corresponding color of that word one extra time.",0.8,29,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to consistently result in a sequence of ""green"" that matches the length of the preceding sequence of words before ""walm"". To determine the rule, let's examine each example:

1. ""dax zup dax walm"" yields ""green yellow green green green"". Here ""walm"" produces a sequence of ""green"" that is two units long, matching the two ""dax"" which are also ""green"".
2. ""dax walm"" yields ""green green green"". ""walm"" produces a sequence of two additional ""greens"", matching the single ""dax"" that is ""green"".
3. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" yields ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"". ""walm"" produces a sequence of three ""yellows"", matching the two ""zup"" and the preceding ""lug"" before ""walm"".
4. ""zup wif walm"" yields ""yellow red red red"". ""walm"" produces a sequence of three ""red"", which is different from previous examples, as it matches the count and not the color of ""zup wif"" before ""walm"".
5. ""dax walm zup"" yields ""green green green yellow"". Here, ""walm"" only affects the word before it resulting in two additional ""greens"" matching the single ""dax"".

A potential rule for ""walm"" could be a function that repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word for a number of times equal to the total count of words prior to ""walm"". However, example 4 seems to contradict the matching of colors and instead, matches the count of words before ""walm"".

Considering the contradiction in example 4 and the consistency in the other examples, a tentative rule for ""walm"" would be:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the output color associated with the immediately preceding word as many times as there are total words before ""walm"" in the sequence.

Based on the available data and the tentative rule derived, the nonce word ""walm"" influences the output by repeating colors according to the preceding pattern. However, an additional example or further context would be helpful to confirm this rule due to the discrepancy in example 4.",0.8,29,walm

"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look at the consistent patterns before and after the word appears as well as its corresponding color output.

1. In all instances where ""bluf"" appears, the output for ""bluf"" is always ""yellow.""
2. Looking at the various positions of ""bluf"" within the inputs doesn't seem to change its output - it remains ""yellow"" regardless of its position.
3. The positions of other words relative to ""bluf"" do not appear to affect their own outputs, suggesting ""bluf"" does not modify the outputs of adjacent words.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the color ""yellow"" without context dependency.

Rule: bluf -> yellow",1.0,30,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red when preceding the word ""dax"" and to the color yellow when following the word ""dax"" or ""wif"". In the absence of ""dax"" or ""wif"" preceding it, ""bluf"" leads to the color yellow. 

Therefore, based on the given data, it seems that bluf does not have a fixed color association and is context-dependent. However, given the limited examples and the possibility of other influencing factors not accounted for in these examples, this rule might not be comprehensive or entirely accurate. More examples would be needed to solidify or refute this rule.",0.6,30,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can try to discern patterns associated with the word ""bluf"" and the corresponding color outputs. Here's the analysis:

1. ""dax bluf zup"" results in ""green green yellow""; ""dax zup bluf"" results in ""green yellow yellow."" This suggests that ""dax"" always maps to ""green"" and ""bluf"" results in different colors depending on its position relative to ""zup.""

2. The third input: ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" produces varied colors, including ""bluf"" resulting in ""yellow"" when following ""zup,"" which is also ""yellow.""

3. In the fourth input, ""wif bluf dax"" maps to ""red red green."" This implies that ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""bluf"" is ""red"" when positioned between ""wif"" and ""dax.""

4. Finally, ""zup bluf wif dax lug"" leads to ""yellow yellow red green blue."" In this scenario, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" and is yellow, and the other words maintain their consistent color associations (e.g., ""wif"" -> ""red,"" ""dax"" -> ""green"").

Given these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" changes color based on specific rules that involve its place in the sequence or its surrounding words. However, based on the examples provided and considering the color consistency of the other words, the most reliable rule we can deduce is:

When ""bluf"" directly follows ""zup,"" it results in ""yellow.""

Outside of this condition, we have insufficient data to determine the exact rule for ""bluf"" regarding the other color outputs (""red"" in the presence of ""wif"" and ""green"" when near ""dax"") without making potentially inaccurate assumptions. Thus, the proper rule underlying ""bluf"" is not completely clear, but we can formulate the one solid rule we have observed.

Rule: When ""bluf"" directly follows ""zup,"" it results in the color ""yellow."" 

To assert more specific rules for other instances of ""bluf,"" we would require additional examples to analyze.",0.5,30,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we must analyze the position of ""bluf"" in the input and the corresponding color in the output.

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" is in the second position and the output is ""green.""
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" is in the third position and the output is ""yellow.""
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" is in the third position and the output is ""yellow.""
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is in the second position and the output is ""red.""
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is in the second position and the output is ""yellow.""

Since the word ""bluf"" produces different colors when it is in different positions relative to other words, it suggests that the meaning of ""bluf"" is rule-dependent and not fixed. It looks like the output color for ""bluf"" depends on its position or the words around it.

Let's consider the positions of ""bluf"" and their respective colors from the examples:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the color is green. (Examples 1 and 4)
- When ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup,"" the color is yellow. (Example 2 and 5)
- When ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" the color is yellow. (Example 3)

One potential rule might be that ""bluf"" changes its color based on the word it follows or the word that follows it, but this is not entirely consistent with the examples provided. It could be that ""bluf"" mirrors the color of the word that it follows or that precedes it, except when ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" or before ""zup,"" where it seems to have fixed color values. However, given that ""wif bluf dax"" generates the output ""red red green,"" this hypothesis does not hold since ""bluf"" is not following ""dax"" but yields a red color like ""wif,"" not green as when it follows ""dax.""

Given the limited examples, we can only guess at the potential rules governing ""bluf."" It's also possible that the color of ""bluf"" is influenced by the position of other words (e.g., the presence of ""lug"" encourages a blue color elsewhere), but the specific nature of this influence is not entirely clear with the provided data.

Due to the insufficient information to pinpoint an exact rule for ""bluf,"" we cannot propose a definitive meaning. More examples would be needed to accurately determine what ""bluf"" means or the rule by which its color is determined.

Rule:
The meaning of ""bluf"" cannot be determined with certainty based on the available examples; its color output is context-dependent and seems to follow a complex pattern related to its position among other words and perhaps specific word associations. Additional data is required to define a precise rule.",0.3,30,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" appears to correspond with the color red when it is not adjacent to the word ""dax"", where it turns into the color yellow. If we consider the proximity to ""dax"" as the determinant of the color assigned to ""bluf"", it can be formulated as follows:

"walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a rule that dictates repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times.

Now, let's look at each input and its corresponding output:

1. ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" which means ""walm"" results in repeating the color associated with ""dax"" three times.
2. ""wif walm lug bluf"" leads to ""red red red blue blue,"" wherein ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times (as ""wif"" is associated with red), and ""bluf"" is not explained but might imply repeating the color associated with ""lug"" (blue) twice.
3. ""zup walm wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" causes the color for ""zup"" (yellow) to be repeated three times, followed by the color corresponding to ""wif"" (red).
4. ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""walm"" again results in the repetition of the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow) three times.

"Observing the patterns and the corresponding outputs, the word 'zup' seems to be linked to the color 'yellow'. This can be deduced from the consistent appearance of 'yellow' in the output whenever 'zup' appears in the input. Here are the deductions for each example:

- In the first example, whenever 'zup' appears, 'yellow' follows. 
- In the second example, between two 'zup' words, 'yellow' appears twice, indicating that 'zup' maps to 'yellow'.
- In the third example, 'zup' is followed by 'yellow' again.
- The fourth example, with 'zup' alone, outputs 'yellow', reinforcing the rule.
- In the fifth example, 'wif' appears once but is followed by 'red', 'zup' appears once and is followed by 'yellow', and then 'bluf' and 'lug' appear, each followed by 'blue'.

Additionally, it appears that ""zup"" has no color of its own but acts as a delimiter or a marker for change in the sequence. 

Therefore:
zup -> Rule: zup acts as a delimiter for color changes in the sequence, with yellow being the starting color whenever zup initiates the sequence.",0.8,31,zup
"To figure out the meaning of the word ""bluf"" based on the examples provided, let's look for patterns closely in the input and output sequences:

1. Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""red"" is part of the output sequence.
2. The occurrence of ""red"" in the output is exclusively tied to the presence of ""bluf"" in the input.
3. The other words ""dax,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""zup"" correlate to other unique colors in the output: ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"".
4. When ""bluf"" is present without ""wif"" preceding it, the color outputted is simply ""green"", the same output as for ""dax"".
5. When both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" are both present, the output is ""red red"" suggesting that ""bluf"" somehow interacts with ""wif"" to produce a double ""red"".

Considering these patterns, it appears that ""bluf"" may translate to or represent the color ""green"". However, when it is preceded by ""wif"", it produces an additional ""red"", leading to ""red red"". Since ""wif"" already translates to ""red"", ""bluf"" might have a different behavior when following ""wif"".

Rule: 
bluf -> ""green"" when alone or not proceeded by ""wif"", however, when it follows ""wif"", it triggers an additional ""red"", thus giving a sequence of ""red red"".",1.0,31,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the word ""bluf"" is related to the color output ""green"" when it follows the word ""dax,"" and it is related to ""red"" when it is preceded by the word ""wif."" When ""bluf"" is between the word ""lug"" and another word, it results in ""blue."" If ""bluf"" stands alone after ""lug"" or is in a sequence without ""dax"" or ""wif,"" it also outputs ""blue.""

The usage of ""bluf"" seems dependent on the context of the words around it—specifically, the words immediately preceding it:

- ""dax"" before ""bluf"" results in green.
- ""wif"" before ""bluf"" results in red.
- ""bluf"" following ""lug"" or standing alone (not preceded by ""dax"" or ""wif"") results in blue.

Therefore, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the preceding word:
- After ""dax,"" bluf means green.
- After ""wif,"" bluf means red.
- After ""lug"" or when standalone, bluf means blue.",1.0,31,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the paired outputs:

1. ""dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green red red.""
2. ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green.""
3. ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" corresponds to ""green blue blue blue green red red green.""
4. ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" corresponds to ""green blue yellow red red green.""
5. ""lug bluf zup"" corresponds to ""blue blue yellow.""

From these examples, we notice that:

- The word ""bluf"" alone corresponds to an output color of ""green"" as seen in example 2 where ""dax bluf"" outputs ""green green.""
- The word ""bluf"" seems to take the color of the preceding word (if applicable) as seen in example 1 where ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red"" and in example 5 where ""lug bluf"" outputs ""blue blue.""
- When ""bluf"" is following a series of words, it seems to output a color matching the immediate word before it, as seen in example 3 (""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red"") and in example 4 (""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red"").

From these observations, the rule seems to be:

Thus, bluf -> meaning. Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word in the output.",1.0,31,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red

"Considering the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to relate to the repetition of the color that corresponds to the word mentioned right before it. Based on the observations:

- When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""green"" repeated.
- ""Lug"" followed by ""walm"" yields a repetition of ""blue.""
- ""Wif"" before ""walm"" results in ""red"" being repeated.
- ""Zup"" in front of ""walm"" leads to ""yellow"" being repeated.

Additionally, the number of times the color is repeated corresponds to the position of ""walm"" in the sequence. For example:

- In ""dax lug walm,"" ""lug"" is the second word and ""walm"" is the third, so ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- In ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" is the first word and ""walm"" is the second, so ""green"" is mentioned twice.

1. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue"":
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

Based on the examples, it seems that ""walm"" takes the color of the word before it and repeats it three times. However, in the last example, the pattern appears to include repeating the previous color an additional time after the next color word appears (""wif lug"").

   - ""wif"" follows two ""green"" and one ""blue"" resulting in ""red"".

4. lug walm dax wif lug wif -> blue blue blue green red blue red
   - ""lug"" and ""walm"" both map to ""blue"", and ""dax"" is ""green"".
   - ""wif"" follows this sequence of colors with a ""red"", and it does so twice (after both a ""green"" and a ""blue"").

5. zup wif bluf zup -> yellow red red yellow

- In the fourth example, ""lug"" is blue, and after ""lug wif"", the sequence is blue-red, again indicating a color change follows ""wif"".
- In the fifth example, the color change appears after ""wif"", turning ""bluf zup"" into red-yellow instead of their previous associated colors if ""wif"" were not there.

So the rule seems to be that ""wif"" changes the color associated with the following word. If no word follows ""wif"", it seems to default to red (as seen in the second example).

Rule: wif -> changes the next word's associated color (if there is no next word, then the output is red).",0.9,32,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" appears to trigger a change in the output color pattern in a way that is dependent on the preceding word. The rule seems to be that ""wif"" indicates that the next color should be ""red."" Here's how this rule applies to each input:

- In the first input, ""wif"" is followed by ""zup,"" so it changes the output from the expected green for ""dax"" to red, then the pattern continues with ""yellow"" for ""zup.""
- In the second input, there is no word after ""wif,"" but ""wif"" itself results in ""red.""
- In the third input, ""dax lug dax wif dax,"" the presence of ""wif"" after the third ""dax"" changes the output color from green to red, and then it resumes with green for the following ""dax.""
- In the fourth input, ""wif"" appears twice and continues the pattern before it but each time changes the output color to red regardless of what the previous color would have been (blue for ""lug"" or green for ""dax"").
- In the fifth input, ""zup wif"" leads to ""yellow red,"" indicating that ""wif"" changes the output to red regardless of the color that ""zup"" would indicate on its own, which is yellow.

The general rule for the word ""wif"" appears to be:

wif -> meaning: The presence of ""wif"" changes the next color in the sequence to red.

Rule: If ""wif"" is present, the color that follows it in the output will be red.",0.8,32,wif
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in each provided example, regardless of additional context. When ""wif"" is present, the output includes ""red"" alongside ""yellow"", and when ""lug"" is added, ""blue"" is also included. However, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"".",1.0,32,zup
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" while the presence of additional words after ""zup"" add more colors to the output in a specific order. More specifically:

- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Thus, we can induce the following rules:

- zup -> yellow
- zup wif -> yellow red
- zup wif lug -> yellow red blue

Rule: ""zup"" indicates an initial color ""yellow."" Sequential words following ""zup"" add predetermined additional colors in a set sequence.",1.0,32,zup
"zup -> meaning. The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.

Rule:
1. Whenever the word ""zup"" is used alone, the output is ""yellow.""
2. When ""zup"" is used with ""wif,"" the output is ""yellow red.""
3. When ""zup"" is used with ""wif lug,"" the output is ""yellow red blue.""

Further usage patterns would be needed to expand on these rules, but from the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and additional words (""wif,"" ""lug"") add more colors in a specific sequence.",1.0,32,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the outputs. When ""zup"" is present alone, the output is ""yellow."" When it is followed by other words such as ""wif"" or ""lug,"" additional colors are added to the output sequence following the word ""zup."" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""",1.0,32,zup
"From the examples provided, we can induce the meaning of ""zup"" and its relation with the other words:

- When the input is ""zup wif,"" the output is ""yellow red.""
- When the input is ""zup wif lug,"" the output is ""yellow red blue.""
- The input ""zup wif"" consistently yields ""yellow red.""
- The input ""zup"" alone yields ""yellow.""

Based on this pattern, we can infer the following meanings:

- ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" seems to contribute to ""red.""
- ""lug"" appears when ""blue"" is added to the output.

However, since ""red"" and ""blue"" are not produced in the output by themselves, and only occur when the terms ""wif"" and ""lug"" are added, we can assume their presence is contingent on being preceded by the word ""zup."" We can summarize:

Rule: 
- ""zup"" by itself stands for ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" in combination with ""zup"" contributes ""red"" to the output.
- ""lug"" in combination with ""zup wif"" contributes ""blue,"" completing the sequence with ""yellow red blue"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule is that ""zup"" likely signifies ""yellow,"" and the addition of other words after ""zup"" adds more colors to the sequence in a fixed order.",1.0,32,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Each instance of ""bluf"" in the inputs correlates directly with ""red"" in the outputs. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

bluf -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" means ""red.""",1.0,32,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to consistently translate to the color ""red"". Regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words around it, ""bluf"" always corresponds to ""red"" in the output.

"walm -> meaning: The word ""walm"" causes the color prior to it to be repeated three times.

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" is present in the input, the output repeats the corresponding color of the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times.",1.0,32,walm
"walm -> rule: The word ""walm"" results in the output of three repetitions of the color that corresponds with the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, output that word's corresponding color three times. For example, if ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, then ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"". If ""walm"" is the first word or follows a word with no established color correspondence, it seems to default to ""red red red"", as observed in ""wif walm"".",1.0,32,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the output color is repeated three times in sequence whenever the word ""walm"" is present in the input. Additionally, each non-walm word corresponds to a unique color:

- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue

Given this information, we can deduce that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. 

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the preceding word's corresponding color three times.",1.0,32,walm
"Based on the above examples, the meaning of ""walm"" can be deduced from the output as follows:

- ""zup walm"" gives us ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""wif walm dax zup"" gives us ""red red red green yellow""
- ""lug zup walm lug"" gives us ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue""
- ""zup lug walm wif walm"" gives us ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""
- ""lug walm"" gives us ""blue blue blue""

Looking at the outputs associated with ""walm,"" it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word. Here's how it breaks down:

- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red""
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue""

So when ""walm"" follows any of these words, the color output is repeated three times. For this reason, it appears that the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,32,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color that follows immediately after the word ""walm"". Here are some observations which support this:

1. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"" (Here, 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', and 'walm' results in the word 'yellow' being repeated three times.)

2. ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow"" (Here, 'wif' produces 'red', 'dax' corresponds to 'green', and 'zup' gives 'yellow'. The word 'walm' causes the word 'red' to be repeated three times before proceeding to the next color.)

3. ""lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"" (Here, 'lug' generates 'blue', 'zup' gives 'yellow', and 'walm' results in 'yellow' being repeated three times, before the sequence ends with another 'blue'.)

4. ""zup lug walm wif walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red red red"" (Here the pattern continues with 'zup' corresponding to 'yellow', 'lug' to 'blue', and 'walm' causes the repetition of 'blue' three times followed by 'wif' which produces 'red', and 'walm' leads to 'red' being repeated three times.)

5. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"" (Similarly, 'lug' results in 'blue', and 'walm' causes 'blue' to be repeated three times.)

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" could be stated as follows:

walm -> Repeat the color word that immediately follows ""walm"" three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" is used after a color-indicating word, repeat that color word three times in the output.",0.8,32,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output regardless of its position within the input sequence.",1.0,33,lug

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the outputs.",1.0,33,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.",1.0,33,lug
"Based on the provided examples, dax corresponds to the color green. In each instance, the word ""dax"" always results in the output of the word ""green."" 

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,33,dax
"Based on the input and output examples provided, we can induce the following associations:

- ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue""

In all cases where ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green"". Regardless of its position in the input, ""dax"" consistently results in ""green"" in the output. There is no variation in the output associated with ""dax"" that would suggest its meaning changes based on context or position. Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" is that it corresponds to the color ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,33,dax
"Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" reliably corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output. Here's the breakdown of each example, matching the inputs with their respective outputs:

- wif zup dax -> red yellow green
- lug dax zup wif -> blue green yellow red
- dax lug bluf dax -> green blue blue green
- wif dax -> red green
- dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue

Since ""dax"" is always translated to ""green"" regardless of its position or surrounding words, we can deduce the meaning as follows:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,33,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" translates to the color ""green."" This is evident from the consistent presence of the word ""green"" in the output whenever ""dax"" is in the input. 

To confirm the rule, we can examine each occurrence of ""dax"":

Example 1: ""wif zup dax"" becomes ""red yellow green."" ""Dax"" is the third word and is translated to ""green,"" the third color in the output.
Example 2: ""lug dax zup wif"" becomes ""blue green yellow red."" Here ""dax"" is the second word and corresponds to ""green,"" the second color in the output.
Example 3: ""dax lug bluf dax"" becomes ""green blue blue green."" ""Dax"" appears twice, at the first and fourth positions, translating both times to ""green,"" which is the first and last color in the output.
Example 4: ""wif dax"" becomes ""red green."" ""Dax"" is the second word, and ""green"" is the second color.
Example 5: ""dax lug walm"" becomes ""green blue blue blue."" ""Dax"" is the first word and translates to ""green,"" the first color.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,33,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let us first map each known word to its corresponding output color based on the examples provided:

- ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red.""
- ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue.""
- No other information is provided for ""bluf"" or ""walm,"" but we see that ""lug bluf"" and ""lug walm"" both produce ""blue blue"" as part of the output, suggesting both ""bluf"" and ""walm"" could also map to ""blue,"" or it could be coincidental repetition.

Examining the use of ""dax"":

1. In the first example, ""dax"" is placed between ""zup"" (yellow) and the end of the input sequence, and ""green"" is the last color in the output sequence.
2. In the second example, ""dax"" is placed between ""lug"" (blue) and ""zup"" (yellow), and ""green"" is in the second position in the output sequence, following ""blue"" and preceding ""yellow.""
3. In the third example, ""dax"" appears twice and is both followed and preceded by known terms. Each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
4. In the fourth example, ""dax"" follows ""wif"" (red) and ""green"" follows ""red"" in the output.
5. In the fifth example, ""dax"" precedes ""lug"" (blue), and ""green"" precedes ""blue"" in the output.

From these observations, it seems that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green,"" regardless of its position relative to other words.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,33,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" aligns with the output ""red"" regardless of its position in the input or the other words present. Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,33,wif
"wif -> red. Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,33,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to a specific color each time it is used:

- When ""wif"" appeared with ""bluf"" and ""dax walm"", the output was ""red red green green green"".
- Whenever ""wif"" appeared alone or with other words, ""red"" was always part of the output.

From this pattern, we can induce the rule that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,33,wif
"Based on the examples given, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Every time the word ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" appears in the output, regardless of the position of ""wif"" within the sequence.

Hence, the rule is:

wif -> red",1.0,33,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Each time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output at the same position. To write this in the requested format:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,33,wif
"To deduce the rule, let's analyze the occurrences of 'zup' and the corresponding outputs step by step.

1. Input: wif dax zup
   Output: red green yellow
2. Input: lug dax zup dax wif
   Output: blue green yellow green red
3. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
4. Input: zup
   Output: yellow
5. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

In each case where 'zup' appears, the word 'yellow' immediately follows it in the output, including when 'zup' is the only input word. The presence of 'zup' does not seem to affect the output of the succeeding words, as their outputs are consistent regardless of whether 'zup' precedes them.

Based on these examples, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,33,zup
"To induce the rule for the word ""zup,"" let's look at each example and identify any patterns.

1. Input: wif dax zup 
   Output: red green yellow

2. Input: lug dax zup dax wif 
   Output: blue green yellow green red

3. Input: zup walm dax lug 
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

4. Input: zup 
   Output: yellow

5. Input: zup lug walm wif dax 
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

Analyzing the outputs associated with each input, we can make the following observations:

- Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output.
- The output for ""zup"" does not seem to depend on its position in the input string.

Given these observations, it seems that the rule for ""zup"" is consistent regardless of other words or the position of ""zup"" in the sequence. Therefore, we can hypothesize:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,33,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is used in an input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the respective output at the same position. 

Thus, the rule is: zup -> yellow.",1.0,33,zup
"Based on the given examples, it seems that each word in the input corresponds to a unique color in the output. The word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the list of words.

Therefore, the rule is:
zup -> yellow.",1.0,33,zup
"Observing the examples given and the corresponding outputs, we can deduce the following:

- Each example containing the word ""zup"" yields ""yellow"" in the output sequence.
- The placement of ""zup"" in the input does not seem to affect other words; it simply corresponds to the word ""yellow"" at its particular position.
- There are no examples that contradict the assumption that ""zup"" translates directly to ""yellow.""

Therefore, the meaning of ""zup"" based on the given examples is consistent and can be defined as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,33,zup
"Reviewing the examples provided and their corresponding outputs, it appears that the word 'bluf' relates to the word 'blue,' but it is not always directly translated to 'blue' in the output. 

In the first example, 'lug bluf dax bluf' translates to 'blue blue green green,' indicating that 'bluf' means 'blue' when following 'lug,' but 'green' when following 'dax.'

In the second example, 'zup bluf dax' translates to 'yellow yellow green,' suggesting that 'bluf' means 'yellow' when following 'zup,' but 'green' when followed by 'dax.'

The third example, 'lug wif lug bluf,' translates to 'blue red blue blue,' which means that 'bluf' means 'blue' when it is preceded by 'lug.'

The fourth example, 'zup dax bluf,' translates to 'yellow green green,' reinforcing the idea from the second example that 'bluf' means 'green' when it comes after 'dax.'

Last example, 'zup bluf wif dax lug' translates to 'yellow yellow red green blue,' which indicates that 'bluf' is 'yellow' after 'zup,' 'red' after 'wif,' 'green' after 'dax,' and 'blue' after 'lug.'

From these examples, it can be deduced that the meaning of 'bluf' is dependent on the word immediately preceding it. The rule appears to be as follows:

- After 'lug,' 'bluf' means 'blue.'
- After 'zup,' 'bluf' means 'yellow.'
- After 'dax,' 'bluf' means 'green.'
- After 'wif,' 'bluf' appears to mean 'red.'

Therefore, the rule is:

bluf -> meaning changes based on the preceding word: after 'lug' it means 'blue,' after 'zup' it means 'yellow,' after 'dax' it means 'green,' and after 'wif' it means 'red'.",1.0,33,bluf
"Rule: When ""bluf"" is preceded by a word, it takes the color that the word represents, but when it is the first time the word appears or is at the end of the sequence without a preceding color word, it defaults to green. 

So:

lug bluf -> blue (as ""lug"" means blue)
dax bluf -> green (as ""dax"" means green, but here ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and should mean green because it is at the end)
zup bluf -> yellow (as ""zup"" means yellow)
wif bluf -> blue (as ""wif"" doesn't have a color meaning and ""bluf"" here is following ""lug"" which means blue)

bluf -> green when it is at the end or not preceded by a color word, otherwise it takes the color of the word it follows.",0.8,33,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, it seems that whenever the word ""bluf"" occurs, it takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the series. If there is no word before ""bluf,"" it defaults to the color green. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word, or green if no preceding word is available.",0.8,33,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns where the word appears and the corresponding output.

1. When ""bluf"" appears twice in a row after ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue."" This could imply ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue.""
2. When ""bluf"" appears alone after ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow."" This could imply ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow.""
3. When ""bluf"" appears following ""lug wif lug,"" the output is ""blue red blue blue."" Since ""lug"" correlates to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" correlates to ""red,"" the final ""bluf"" translates to ""blue.""
4. When ""bluf"" appears after ""zup dax,"" the output is ""yellow green green,"" hinting that ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" in this context.
5. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""wif dax lug,"" the output starts with ""yellow yellow,"" suggesting ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"" even when followed by other words.

From these observations, we can infer that ""bluf"" is context-dependent and switches meaning based on the preceding word. Specifically:

- After ""lug,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""blue.""
- After ""zup,"" ""bluf"" results in a repetition of ""yellow.""
- After ""dax,"" ""bluf"" turns into ""green.""

Rule: ""bluf"" is a modifier that changes its meaning based on the preceding word:

- ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue""
- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"" (repeating the color corresponding to ""zup"")
- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green"" (perhaps indicating a change in color from what ""dax"" usually represents)",0.8,33,bluf
"bluf -> yellow

"Rule: walm means a repetition of the color word preceding it three times.

walm -> meaning: repeat the color word before ""walm"" three times.",1.0,33,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to correspond to a specific pattern of output colors. To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we'll analyze each instance where it appears:

- In the first example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red,"" indicating that ""walm"" may signify a repetition of the color associated with the word before it, which is ""red"".

- In the second example, ""lug walm zup lug walm"" becomes ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue"". This suggests that ""walm"" following ""lug"" results in the color blue being repeated three times, and the same pattern occurs after the word ""zup,"" although it is interrupted by another instance of ""lug"".

- In the third example, ""lug wif zup wif walm"" translates to ""blue red yellow red red red"". Once again, ""walm"" after ""wif"" results in a repetition of the color ""red.""

- In the fourth example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"", supporting the pattern observed where ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""lug"".

- In the fifth example, ""dax lug walm zup wif"" gives ""green blue blue blue yellow red"". ""Walm"" repeats the color for ""lug"" (""blue"") three times.

Based on the examples above, the rule seems to be that the word ""walm"" causes the previous color word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,33,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" dictates the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, in a three-fold repetition.

   ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and following ""walm"" we get three reds.

2. Input: lug walm zup lug walm

3. Input: lug wif zup wif walm

4. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Again, ""lug"" followed by ""walm' results in three blues.

5. Input: dax lug walm zup wif

Rule: ""dax"" -> green
Meaning: ""dax"" means ""green.""",1.0,34,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green."" Every occurrence of ""dax"" in the input results in ""green"" in the output.",1.0,34,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

The consistent pattern in each example is that the presence of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output. The word following ""dax"" is translated to another color in the output. ""Dax"" itself does not seem to depend on context, as it always translates directly to ""green,"" regardless of its position or the words around it. 

Other words in the input such as ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" and ""lug"" seem to translate to ""red,"" ""green,"" and ""blue,"" respectively, but those translations are not in the scope of the question about the meaning of ""dax.""",1.0,34,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

The appearance of the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output irrespective of its position in the input sequence, whether it appears alone or with other nonce words like ""wif"", ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" or ""lug.""",1.0,34,dax
"Based on the given examples, ""wif"" seems to indicate the word ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. Here's the breakdown of how ""wif"" correlates with the output:

- ""zup wif lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"" (wif correlates with the second word, which is red)
- ""dax wif"" -> ""green red"" (wif correlates with the second word, which is red)
- ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red"" (wif correlates with the second word, which is red)
- ""wif lug zup"" -> ""red blue yellow"" (wif correlates with the first word, which is red)
- ""wif walm zup"" -> ""red red red yellow"" (wif correlates with the first word, which is red)

Based on these correlations, it can be deduced that:

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,34,wif
"The examples provided suggest that ""wif"" is associated with the color red. To further support this, when observing each input and its respective output, we see that:

1. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" produces ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow,"" and we can hypothesize that ""zup"" relates to ""yellow,"" as it appears before each yellow in the output. Although ""walm"" appears once in the input and three times ""yellow"" appears in the output, the presence of ""wif"" directly before it might influence the number of times ""yellow"" appears.

2. ""dax wif"" has the output ""green red,"" which directly follows, suggesting ""dax"" relates to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

3. ""zup wif walm"" produces ""yellow red red red,"" supporting the idea that ""zup"" relates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""walm"" might be influenced by ""wif"" to produce additional ""red"" as opposed to other colors.

4. ""wif lug zup"" and ""wif walm zup"" both start with ""wif,"" which yields a ""red"" at the beginning of their respective outputs, again reinforcing the association of ""wif"" with ""red.""

Based on the patterns observed, it is clear that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red regardless of its position or the context within the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,34,wif
"Given the examples, we can infer that ""wif"" signifies a change in the pattern for the word that follows it:

- In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" but when ""wif"" comes before ""lug,"" the output turns ""red."" Then ""zup walm"" also outputs ""yellow yellow yellow,"" but it seems that ""wif"" has modified ""lug"" to produce ""red.""
- In the second example, we only have ""dax wif,"" similar to ""lug,"" as ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" but after ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""
- The third example demonstrates that ""zup"" is ""yellow"" again, but ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" indicating that ""wif"" has again caused a change for ""walm,"" making it output ""red"" instead of its original color.
- ""wif lug zup"" shows that ""lug"" is ""blue"" by itself, but once again, ""wif"" directly before modifies it to ""red,"" as seen in the output.
- Similarly, ""wif walm zup"" modifies ""walm"" to result in ""red red red"" before resuming the original color for ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""

Considering the consistency of the output, the word ""wif"" seems to change the color association of the word that follows it to ""red."" 

Rule: wif -> changes the following word's associated color to red.",1.0,34,wif
"Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color red.",1.0,34,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by comparing the outputs associated with its presence in the input against those without it. We'll look at each example and note the output patterns:

1. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow""
   - ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow""
   - The presence of ""wif"" before ""lug"" seems to insert the ""red"" before ""blue"", which might correspond to ""lug""
   - The presence of ""wif"" before ""walm"" seems to change the output completely to three ""yellow""

2. ""dax wif"" -> ""green red""
   - With only ""dax"" before ""wif"", and no other context, we have ""green red""
   - ""dax"" is not present in other examples, so it's unclear what its standalone output is
   - ""wif"" follows ""dax"" and once again is associated with ""red""

3. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
   - ""zup"" again corresponds with ""yellow""
   - The presence of ""wif"" before ""walm"" is associated with three ""red""

4. ""wif lug zup"" -> ""red blue yellow""
   - ""wif"" is the first word and is associated with the first ""red""
   - Following the pattern, ""lug"" would correspond to ""blue"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow""

5. ""wif walm zup"" -> ""red red red yellow""
   - ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and is again associated with red
   - In the presence of ""wif,"" ""walm"" seems to output additional ""red""
   - ""zup"" at the end consistently outputs ""yellow""

Based on these observations, the common thread appears to be that whenever ""wif"" precedes another word, a ""red"" is inserted before the color that would normally represent the word that follows ""wif"". Also, when ""wif"" is directly followed by ""walm,"" it triggers a sequence of three ""red"" instead of a single ""red."" However, ""wif"" alone at the beginning or in a two-word sequence seems to just output a single ""red.""

Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""wif"" before another vocab item causes ""red"" to be inserted in the output sequence, with specific modifications like tripling the ""red"" when directly before ""walm"". When ""wif"" is at the beginning or followed by no other context, it corresponds to a single ""red"".",0.9,34,wif

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,34,zup
"zup -> yellow. 

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" whenever it appears in the input.",1.0,34,zup
"Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Every time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. Other words are consistently translated to other colors: ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" Therefore:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,34,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""zup"" appears to translate to the color ""yellow"" consistently each time it is used. Regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present, ""zup"" is always linked to the output ""yellow"". Thus, we induce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,34,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the examples provided:

1. ""zup lug"" translates to ""yellow blue,"" thus zup corresponds to the color yellow and lug corresponds to the color blue.
2. ""zup walm wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow red."" In this example, walm corresponds to a repetition of the preceding color, in this case yellow repeated three times, and wif corresponds to the color red.
3. ""zup lug dax lug"" translates to ""yellow blue green blue."" Here again, zup corresponds to yellow, lug to blue, and dax introduces the color green.
4. The single term ""zup,"" when provided as input, yields ""yellow,"" reinforcing that zup corresponds to the color yellow irrespective of the context.
5. ""wif lug zup"" translates to ""red blue yellow,"" showing once again that zup corresponds to yellow and confirming that lug is blue and wif is red.

Therefore, regardless of context, the word zup always translates to the color yellow.",1.0,34,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to the repeating color of the word that comes before it. Here is the analysis:

- In ""zup bluf dax"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In ""wif bluf"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red.""
- In ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the following ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" as well.
- In ""lug bluf"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it takes the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the preceding word",1.0,34,bluf
"bluf -> the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" is used after another word, the color output is the same as the color corresponding to that preceding word. For example, ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"", and ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue"".",1.0,34,bluf
"Based on the given examples, bluf appears to correspond color-wise to the word that precedes it. The rule seems to be that bluf takes on the color associated with the previous word. 

To confirm this:

- In example 1, zup corresponds to yellow, and thus bluf also corresponds to yellow.
- In example 2, wif corresponds to red, and bluf also corresponds to red.
- In example 3, dax corresponds to green, and bluf, which follows, also corresponds to green. This is consistent with the colors that precede the second occurrence of bluf, which corresponds to a ""wif"" that is red.
- Examples 4 and 5 are the same, with lug corresponding to blue, followed by bluf, which also corresponds to blue, reinforcing the rule.

Therefore, the rule implicit in these examples is:

bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word.",1.0,34,bluf
"Bluf -> meaning. Each instance of ""bluf"" corresponds to an output color that is the same as the preceding color mentioned in the input. Rule: ""bluf"" means to repeat the color of the previous word.

Explanation of rule induction based on examples:

1. ""zup bluf dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow green,"" where ""bluf"" matches the color yellow, which is the color corresponding to ""zup.""

2. ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" where ""bluf"" matches the color red, which is the color corresponding to ""wif.""

3. ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue red green green red,"" where the first instance of ""bluf"" corresponds to the color green, which matches the color for ""dax,"" and the second instance of ""bluf"" corresponds to red.

4. ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" where ""bluf"" matches the color blue, which corresponds to ""lug.""

5. ""lug bluf"" repeats with the same translation, reaffirming the rule that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word. 

Thus, the rule is confirmed across multiple examples.",1.0,34,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should examine the output associated with its occurrence and see if there's a predictable pattern:

- Whenever ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow green.""
- Whenever ""bluf"" occurs without a preceding ""zup,"" but follows ""wif"" or ""lug,"" the output is the same color repeated (red red, blue blue).

This pattern suggests that ""bluf,"" when it follows a word, makes the output produce the same color associated with the preceding word. ""Zup"" introduces a different pattern, causing the output to be ""yellow green.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" or ""wif,"" it causes a repetition of the color associated with that word (blue or red, respectively).
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it changes the second output color (to green in this case, but it is possible that ""zup"" followed by a different word might give us a different color pattern).

Now, let's craft the rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> meaning: When ""bluf"" follows a word, the associated color for that word is repeated in the output, except when it follows ""zup,"" which has an exceptional output pattern.",0.9,34,bluf
"Observing the provided examples and the corresponding outputs, we can attempt to induce the rule that governs the nonce word ""walm.""

In the given outputs, the appearance of ""walm"" correlates with a repetition of the color that immediately precedes its first mention. The number of repetitions seems to be governed by a count starting from one, determined by the order in which the colors are introduced. To clarify:

- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" must mean ""yellow,"" and since ""walm"" is the second word, it corresponds to ""yellow"" being repeated two additional times (for a total of three mentions of ""yellow"").
  
- In ""wif lug walm,"" ""wif"" results in ""red,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" Since ""walm"" is the third word, it corresponds to ""blue"" being repeated three times (including the original mention, thus four times in total).
  
- For ""zup wif dax walm lug,"" we have ""yellow"" for ""zup,"" ""red"" for ""wif,"" and ""green"" for ""dax."" ""Walm"" appears as the fourth word, so ""green"" is repeated four times. ""Lug"" is a new word that translates to ""blue.""

- ""zup wif walm"" leads to ""yellow red red red."" Here, ""walm"" as the third word means ""red"" is repeated twice more (three times total).

- In ""dax walm wif,"" ""dax"" means ""green,"" and ""wif"" is ""red."" ""Walm"" appears as the second word, so ""green"" is said three times in total.

According to these observations, the rule for ""walm"" can be described as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word. The quantity of repetition equals one less than the position of the first occurrence of ""walm"" in the input. For example, if ""walm"" is the second word in the sequence, the color is repeated two times in total.

Thus, the rule is:
Walm -> Repeat the preceding color word in the output, the number of times equal to its order of appearance in the input sequence.",1.0,34,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the correlation between the presence of ""walm"" in the input and the corresponding output:

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" corresponds to a single ""yellow""

2. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

3. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

5. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

From these examples, we can see that when ""walm"" is present, the color corresponding to the word just before ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.",1.0,34,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be associated with a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. The number of repetitions correlates with the total number of words that appear before ""walm"".

Looking at the examples:

1. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
   - ""zup"" is equal to one ""yellow"", and as ""walm"" comes after, it repeats ""yellow"" three times (once for ""zup"" and two more times due to ""walm"").

2. ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", then ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to ""lug"" (the word immediately before it) three times because there are three words before ""walm"".

3. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" -> ""yellow red green green green blue""
   - The pattern continues with ""zup"" as ""yellow"", ""wif"" as ""red"", ""dax"" as ""green"", then ""walm"" repeats the ""green"" three times and finally ""lug"" is ""blue"".

4. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
   - The pattern here is similar; ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""wif"" is ""red"". ""Walm"" comes after ""wif"" and repeats ""red"" three times.

5. ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green green green red""
   - Here ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and gets repeated three times as ""green"" and then ""wif"" is ""red"".

From these, the rule for ""walm"" can be deduced:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" a number of times equal to the count of words before ""walm"" (including the word that provides the color) plus one more repetition.",1.0,34,walm
"Observing the examples given, the term ""walm"" seems to be a rule for repeating the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it, three more times. Here are corresponding colors for each word based on the examples:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green

Each time ""walm"" appears, it affects the word before it by repeating the color associated with that word three times. To illustrate, let's look at the examples:

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   
   ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" repeats that color three times.

2. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   
   Here ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" repeats that color three times.

By applying this pattern to all given examples, we can infer the following rule:

walm -> meaning. Meaning is that walm induces the repetition of the color corresponding to the word that precedes it. Rule: If a word is followed by ""walm"", output the color associated with that word three more times.",1.0,34,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" from the examples provided, let's look closely at each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

2. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue

3. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

5. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red

By analyzing these inputs and outputs, we can attempt to discern a pattern related to the word ""walm"" and how it affects the output:

- In the first example, the word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the word ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the word ""yellow"" two more times.
- In the second example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated three more times.
- In the third example, ""zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""dax"" correspond to ""yellow,"" ""red,"" and ""green,"" respectively, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" leads to three repetitions of ""green"" before ""blue"" is mentioned once due to ""lug.""
- The fourth example has ""zup,"" ""wif,"" corresponding to ""yellow,"" ""red,"" and ""walm"" leads to ""red"" being repeated two more times.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" results in ""green"" being repeated two more times before ""red.""

From these patterns, we can deduce that ""walm"" represents a rule that repeats the color of the word that directly precedes it a number of times. Specifically, it seems to repeat the preceding color word three times, replacing the expectations of a one-to-one mapping between the nonce word and a color.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",0.8,34,walm
lug -> blue,1.0,35,lug

- dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow

It appears that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow."" Therefore:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,35,zup
"Rule: Bluf -> The color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" If ""bluf"" is the first word, then ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of ""dax"" (green).

- In the first example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and outputs red; therefore, ""bluf"" in this context means red.
- In the second example, ""wif"" is again before ""bluf"" and it outputs red, supporting the initial observation.
- In the third example, ""zup"" is before ""bluf"" which outputs yellow, indicating ""bluf"" here means yellow.
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" and ""bluf"" together output yellow yellow, and after ""bluf"" comes ""wif"" which outputs red, consistent with prior examples.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and outputs green; thus, ""bluf"" in this context means green.

Based on these observations:

bluf -> The color that matches the word that is immediately before ""bluf."" If ""bluf"" is at the start of the sequence, default to green, the color associated with ""dax.""",1.0,35,bluf
"To figure out the rule for what ""bluf"" means in this scenario, let's look at each input with their respective outputs and analyze them for patterns:

1. ""dax wif bluf"" -> ""green red red""
2. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
3. ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow""
4. ""zup bluf wif dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow red green blue""
5. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""

From these examples, it appears that the output color following ""bluf"" is a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately before ""bluf."" So, the word ""bluf"" leads to the replication of the prior color in the output sequence.

To confirm this rule, let's examine the examples:

1. In ""dax wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the output color following ""bluf"" is also ""red.""
2. In ""wif bluf,"" there is no word before ""wif,"" but ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" yields ""red"" again.
3. In ""dax zup bluf,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" results in another ""yellow.""
4. In ""zup bluf wif dax lug,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow""; ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue.""
5. In ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" also results in ""green.""

Considering the analysis above, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" in these examples is as follows:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" means the color output should repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it.",1.0,35,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to induce the rule governing the meaning of ""bluf."" Let's examine the input-output pairs:

1. ""dax wif bluf"" -> ""green red red""
2. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
3. ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow""
4. ""zup bluf wif dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow red green blue""
5. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""

Given that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output, we can try to identify what color ""bluf"" corresponds to:

- In the first and second input-output pairs, ""bluf"" appears to correspond to the color ""red.""
- However, in the third input-output pair, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the fourth pair, ""bluf"" could correspond to ""yellow,"" ""red,"" or ""green,"" but based on the other examples, it's more consistent with ""yellow.""
- Finally, in the fifth pair, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""

From these examples, we might initially conclude that ""bluf"" can map to ""red,"" ""yellow,"" or ""green."" However, the output color does not seem to change when the position of ""bluf"" is changed in the sentence, indicating that it is not positional. Additionally, ""bluf"" is not directly associated with one single color, as it maps to different colors in different contexts.

The rule that can be discerned from the examples is that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. To test this, we can check each instance where ""bluf"" is used:

1. The word preceding ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" which maps to ""red""; thus, ""bluf"" is ""red.""
2. Again, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf""; hence, ""bluf"" is ""red.""
3. ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and is ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""
4. ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" again and is ""yellow,"" thus ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""
5. ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and is ""green,"" making ""bluf"" ""green.""

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.",1.0,35,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to translate to a color that is determined by the word that comes immediately before it:

- dax wif bluf -> green red red: Here, ""wif"" comes before ""bluf"", translating to ""red,"" so ""bluf"" also becomes ""red"".
- wif bluf -> red red: Without any context changing words, ""bluf"" seems to adopt the color of the word before it, which is ""wif,"" translating to ""red"".
- dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow: ""zup"" comes before ""bluf"", translating to ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" also becomes ""yellow"".
- zup bluf wif dax lug -> yellow yellow red green blue: ""zup"" before ""bluf"" translates it to ""yellow,"" and without ""bluf"", the other words translate to their corresponding colors.
- dax bluf -> green green: Similarly, with ""dax"" before ""bluf"", it translates to ""green,"" so ""bluf"" also becomes ""green"".

Considering these observations, ""bluf"" translates to the color indicated by the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> the color word that comes immediately before bluf.",0.8,35,bluf
"bluf -> red

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is always ""red."" Regardless of the position of ""bluf"" in the input sequence or the other words around it, its presence dictates that the color ""red"" is output.",0.6,35,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to be a modifier that causes the following word to be repeated a certain number of times equal to the number of times the color associated with the word preceding ""walm"" is represented in the output. Here is the pattern based on each input and its output:

- In the first example, ""lug wif zup wif walm"" leads to ""blue red yellow red red red"". Since ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which is associated with ""red"", ""red"" is repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""wif walm"" generates ""red red red"". Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"", and ""red"" is repeated three times.
- In the third example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"". In this case, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which is correlated with ""blue"", and ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- In the fourth example, ""zup lug walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue"". ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" associated with ""blue"", thus ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- In the fifth example, ""dax walm zup"" produces ""green green green yellow"". ""Walm"" follows ""dax"", which is connected to ""green"", and ""green"" is repeated three times before continuing with the color associated with ""zup"", which is ""yellow"".

- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue as seen in the third example (""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""), and when ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" we get ""blue blue blue.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and when it is followed by ""lug walm,"" we get ""yellow blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" repeats the blue color three times after ""lug.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and when followed by ""walm,"" we get ""green green green,"" thus ""walm"" repeats the color green three times.

"From the given examples, we can deduce the meaning of ""walm"" as follows:

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"".

Rule: ""dax"" translates to ""green"".",1.0,36,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green."" This is evidenced by the fact that in every example where ""dax"" appears, the corresponding output includes the word ""green.""

2. wif lug -> red blue
3. wif walm -> red red red
4. dax wif bluf -> green red red
5. wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

Analyzing the patterns:

- Every time ""wif"" appears, the word ""red"" appears in the output.
- ""wif"" appears at the start of sequences 1-3 and ""red"" is the first color in the output, suggesting that ""wif"" could mean ""red.""
- In sequence 4, ""dax"" precedes ""wif"" and the sequence starts with ""green red,"" which also suggests that ""wif"" might mean ""red,"" while ""dax"" might mean ""green.""
- In sequence 5, the complexity increases due to multiple unknown words, but ""wif"" still corresponds to the first ""red.""

Considering the consistency of ""wif"" associated with ""red"" in the output across all examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,36,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

It appears that ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. In each instance, the color word that comes before ""bluf"" is repeated twice in the output.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the previous word.",1.0,36,bluf
"From the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" is a command to duplicate the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here's how it works based on the examples:

- In ""zup bluf wif walm,"" ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" causes it to double, giving ""yellow yellow."" The sequence ""wif walm"" then relates to ""red red red.""
- In ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" and ""bluf"" doubles it, yielding ""green green.""
- In ""dax lug bluf,"" ""dax"" produces ""green,"" ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" doubles the color immediately before it, which is ""blue,"" resulting in ""blue blue.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

- When ""dax"" comes before ""bluf"", the output is ""green green"".

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the given examples.

- When the word ""walm"" appears in the input, the color sequence in the output appears to repeat the last color seen before ""walm.""

Here are the observations:

1. In the first input, ""lug wif dax walm zup,"" ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and following ""walm,"" the output repeats ""green"" twice before ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow.""
   
2. In the second input, ""lug walm zup,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" it repeats ""blue"" twice before ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow.""
   
3. In the third input, ""wif dax zup walm,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" it repeats ""yellow"" three times.
   
4. In the fourth input, ""lug walm dax wif lug wif,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times before ""dax,"" which translates to ""green,"" and ""wif,"" which translates back to ""red.""
   
5. In the fifth input, ""dax walm wif lug dax walm,"" ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and after each ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated before the next color sequence occurs.

From these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it indicates a repetition of the color that appeared in the output just before it.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last color output before this word.",1.0,36,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be that it changes the output color to the same color as the previous word's output. Here is how the rule applies to each example:

1. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which outputs green, so ""walm"" outputs green.

2. Input: lug walm zup
   Output: blue blue blue yellow
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which outputs blue, so ""walm"" outputs blue.

3. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which outputs yellow, so ""walm"" outputs yellow.

4. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which outputs blue, so ""walm"" outputs blue.

5. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   - The first ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which outputs green, so ""walm"" outputs green.
   - The second ""walm"" again follows ""dax,"" which outputs green, so ""walm"" outputs green.

Rule: walm -> takes the output color of the preceding word.",1.0,36,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the color output pattern in relation to the input phrases that contain ""walm.""

In every instance where ""walm"" appears, its color output is ""green."" However, it's important to observe that ""walm"" doesn't always produce a single ""green."" In some cases, a sequence of ""green"" follows. Let's analyze the pattern:

1. `lug wif dax walm zup` produces `blue red green green green yellow`. Here, the word following ""walm"" (""zup"") corresponds to ""yellow,"" but there are two extra ""green"" before it.

2. `lug walm zup` gives us `blue blue blue yellow`. Again, ""walm"" is followed by multiple instances of ""blue"" (the color corresponding to ""lug""), but this sequence ends when a different word (""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"") appears.

3. `wif dax zup walm` results in `red green yellow yellow yellow`. Here, ""walm"" is at the end, and it's followed by a sequence of ""yellow"" corresponding to the preceding ""zup.""

4. `lug walm dax wif lug wif` turns into `blue blue blue green red blue red`. In this example, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" (""green""), and then the pattern is interrupted by a new word (""wif"" corresponding to ""red"").

5. `dax walm wif lug dax walm` becomes `green green green red blue green green green`. ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (""green"") both times but generates an extra chain of ""greens"" afterwards.

The pattern suggests that ""walm"" duplicates the color of the word immediately preceding it until a new color is introduced or the sequence is repeated. When ""walm"" is at the end of a sequence, it seems to repeat the last color.

In summary, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" generates a sequence of the color corresponding to the word right before it until either a new colored word appears or the same color word repeats.

Therefore, we can define ""walm"" as:

walm -> Generates a sequence of the same color as the preceding word until the appearance of a different color or the repetition of the same color word.",0.9,36,walm
"Based on the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, we can deduce the following rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

- Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, the output color sequence includes consecutive ""green"" starting from the position of ""walm"" until a new distinct color is required by another word (ignoring ""walm""). If ""walm"" is the last word or all subsequent words are again ""walm,"" the output continues with ""green"" until the end.

Here's how the rule applies to each example:

1. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
   Explanation: ""lug"" is blue, ""wif"" is red, ""dax"" is green, and then ""walm"" starts a sequence of ""green"" until ""zup"" which changes it to yellow.

2. Input: lug walm zup
   Output: blue blue blue yellow
   Explanation: ""lug"" is blue, and ""walm"" continues the blue sequence until ""zup,"" which is yellow.

3. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   Explanation: ""wif"" is red, ""dax"" is green, ""zup"" is yellow, and then ""walm"" maintains the yellow sequence to the end.

4. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   Explanation: ""lug"" is blue, ""walm"" continues blue, ""dax"" interrupts with green, ""wif"" changes it to red, another ""lug"" is blue, and again ""wif"" is red.

5. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   Explanation: ""dax"" is green, ""walm"" continues green, ""wif"" changes it to red, ""lug"" turns it blue, then ""dax"" goes back to green, and the final ""walm"" continues the green to the end.

Given this pattern, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears, it extends the sequence of the color represented by the previous word until a new distinct color word appears. If ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence or is followed by repeat occurrences of ""walm,"" the color green continues until the end.

Thus, we can write:

walm -> Extend the color sequence of the previous word with ""green"" until another color word appears or continue with ""green"" until the end if no other color word is present.",0.0,36,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" 

Every time ""lug"" is present in the input, ""blue"" appears the same number of times in the corresponding output.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the input-output pairs for common patterns.

Input: dax lug wif walm
Output: green blue red red red
- The output colors correspond to each input word, with ""walm"" generating three reds.

Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
- Again, the colors correspond to the input words. ""Walm"" is followed by three yellows which match the preceding word ""zup.""

Input: zup dax walm lug wif
Output: yellow green green green blue red
- ""Walm"" produces green which is the color for ""dax,"" the preceding word.

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
- ""Walm"" follows ""wif"" and yields three reds, which correspond to the color for ""wif.""

Input: lug dax walm
Output: blue green green green
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and results in three greens, the color linked to ""dax.""

From the examples, it seems that ""walm"" essentially repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word thrice in the output sequence.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it three times.",1.0,37,walm
"walm -> repeat the color of the previous word. Rule: When the word ""walm"" is used, it indicates that the color of the previous word should be repeated in the output one or more times. For example, ""dax lug wif walm"" corresponds to ""green blue red red red,"" where ""red"" is the color for ""wif"" and is repeated three times because of ""walm.""",1.0,37,walm
"Considering the examples provided, let's analyze the given inputs alongside their outputs:

1. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red

2. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

3. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

5. Input: lug dax walm
   Output: blue green green green

By examining the outputs associated with instances of ""walm"", we can deduce that ""walm"" is followed by the color ""green"" repeated one or more times. The number of times ""green"" appears seems to be related to what comes before ""walm"". Let's investigate further:

1. Before ""walm"" there are three words: ""dax lug wif"" - and after ""walm"" there are three greens.

2. Before ""walm"" there is one word: ""zup"" - and after ""walm"" is a single green.

3. Before ""walm"" there are two words: ""zup dax"" - and after ""walm"" there are two greens. (The repetition of ""green"" is interrupted by ""blue"", which corresponds to ""lug"", but the pattern keeps counting the ""zup"" and ""dax"" before it.)

4. Before ""walm"" there are two words: ""zup wif"" - and after ""walm"" there are three reds (this seems inconsistent with the green pattern).

5. Before ""walm"" there are two words: ""lug dax"" - and after ""walm"" there are three greens.

On closer inspection, there appears to be a discrepancy with the fourth example where ""walm"" is followed by red instead of green. This stands out as an exception which does not fit the deduced rule up until that point - so let's reconsider our deduction by excluding this outlier for a moment.

Looking only at examples 1, 2, 3, and 5, it seems that the rule could be that ""walm"" results in ""green"" repeated for each word that precedes it. However, in example 3, the word ""lug"" causes the output to shift to ""blue"" but continues the count pattern. Therefore, perhaps ""walm"" indicates a repeating color that corresponds to whatever color the word preceding ""walm"" would have translated to, but continues the pattern of repetition.

If we consider ""wif"" to be an exception and potentially translates to ""red"", this would explain the inconsistency in the fourth example, but we would require additional data to fully validate this hypothesis.

Given this reasoning but still considering the inconsistency, we may conclude:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeats the color translation of the word immediately preceding it for as many times as there are words before ""walm"", taking into account that some words might have their specific color translations causing irregularities or exceptions.",0.8,37,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm"", let's analyze the output patterns corresponding to each input that includes ""walm"".

1. dax lug wif walm -> green blue red red red
2. zup walm dax zup dax wif -> yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
3. zup dax walm lug wif -> yellow green green green blue red
4. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
5. lug dax walm -> blue green green green

Some observations can be made regarding the occurrences of ""walm"":

- Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, it corresponds to a sequence of at least three consecutive ""green"" in the output before a different color shows up (if any).
- This sequence of ""green"" in the output appears immediately after the word ""walm"" in the input, except for the position shifting to after a word that has its first occurrence in the input. For example, in input 3, ""walm"" is followed later by ""lug"" which has its first occurrence and is mapped to ""blue"", while the next occurrences of ""green"" follow.

Based on these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" relates to a sequence of ""green"" in the output, and the sequence continues until a new, first-occurring word appears in the input, which causes another color to be output before resuming to ""green"" if ""walm"" influence has not ceased.

Rule: walm -> multiple consecutive ""green"" outputs until a new first-occurrence input word appears; if the word ""walm"" is followed by a first occurrence, the corresponding new color appears once before continuing the ""green"" sequence.",0.8,37,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the pattern of colors in the examples provided where ""walm"" appears and compare them with the surrounding words.

1. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
   Here, ""walm"" is followed by three ""red.""

2. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
   ""walm"" is within the sequence and is followed by ""green,"" then the pattern repeats with ""yellow green,"" ending with ""red.""

3. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red
   In this case, ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" and is followed by three ""green,"" ending with ""blue red.""

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Here, ""walm"" is at the end and is followed by three ""red.""

5. Input: lug dax walm
   Output: blue green green green
   ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" again and is followed by three ""green.""

Based on these examples, we can observe that every time ""walm"" appears, it specifically yields multiple instances (specifically three) of the following color:

- After ""dax,"" it generates three ""green.""
- After ""wif,"" it generates three ""red.""

It is not clear what happens when ""walm"" precedes ""dax"" or when it is the second word in the sequence, as these configurations are not provided in the examples. To formulate the rule for ""walm,"" let's focus on the consistent patterns where it follows ""dax"" and ""wif"":

Rule: When ""walm"" follows the word ""dax,"" it corresponds to three ""green."" When ""walm"" follows the word ""wif,"" it corresponds to three ""red.""

"Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" Regardless of the position of ""wif"" within the input sequence or the other words accompanying it, the output ""red"" remains associated with ""wif."" Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

- When ""wif"" is present alone, the output is ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is present with ""lug"", the output ""blue"" appears after ""red.""

Given these observations, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red"" and when combined with other words, it retains its position in the sequence while the other words are represented by different colors in the sequence order in which they appear.

"Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following rule about the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"":

Each time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the output is ""yellow"" followed by as many repetitions of ""yellow"" as there are words preceding ""bluf"". No words following ""bluf"" in the input seem to affect its associated output.

Here are the relevant examples that can help us understand the pattern:

- Input: zup bluf | Output: yellow yellow | Rule: 1 word before bluf, so ""yellow"" is repeated once after the initial ""yellow"".
- Input: zup wif bluf | Output: yellow red red | Rule: 2 words before bluf, so ""yellow"" is repeated twice, but because ""wif"" translates as ""red,"" we see ""red"" in place of the second ""yellow"".
- Input: wif dax zup bluf | Output: red green yellow yellow | Rule: 3 words before bluf, so ""yellow"" should be repeated thrice, but the translations of ""wif"" (red) and ""dax"" (green) are fixed, leaving only the ""zup"" before ""bluf"" to become an additional ""yellow"".
- Input: dax bluf wif zup | Output: green green red yellow | Rule: 1 word before bluf, so ""yellow"" should be repeated once. The word ""wif"" comes after ""bluf"" hence has no impact on the count of ""yellow"".
- Input: dax wif bluf | Output: green red red | Rule: 2 words before bluf, so ""yellow"" should be repeated twice, but the ""wif"" takes precedence as ""red"".

Based on this pattern, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" is as follows:

Rule: When ""bluf"" appears in the input, output ""yellow"" plus as many repetitions of ""yellow"" as there are words before ""bluf"" in the input, with each word's designated color substituting for ""yellow"" if applicable. Words after ""bluf"" do not influence its output.",1.0,39,bluf
"bluf -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the output is ""yellow"". The context or position of ""bluf"" within the sequence does not alter this output.",1.0,39,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can look at the relationship between the inputs and their respective outputs.

Here are the examples provided with a focus on ""bluf"":

1. zup bluf             -> yellow yellow
2. zup wif bluf         -> yellow red red
3. wif dax zup bluf -> red green yellow yellow
4. dax bluf wif zup  -> green green red yellow
5. dax wif bluf         -> green red red

Now, let's examine these sequences based on the appearance of the word ""bluf"" and note the outputs:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green""

From these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word that comes directly before it. In other words, ""bluf"" seems to double the color output of the preceding word.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> meaning. When ""bluf"" follows a word, the color associated with that word is outputted twice.",1.0,39,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns tied to its usage and the corresponding output across the given examples:

1. Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
2. Input: zup wif bluf -> Output: yellow red red
3. Input: wif dax zup bluf -> Output: red green yellow yellow
4. Input: dax bluf wif zup -> Output: green green red yellow
5. Input: dax wif bluf -> Output: green red red

Analysis:

- Each time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the output has at least one repetition of a color.
- When ""bluf"" appears after a word, it seems to double the color that is associated with that word.
    - ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"" (zup = yellow, bluf doubles it)
    - ""dax bluf"" is a bit more nuanced, as the position of ""bluf"" appears to be important:
        - ""dax bluf wif zup"" -> ""green green red yellow"" (dax = green, bluf follows it and doubles it)
        - ""dax wif bluf"" -> ""green red red"" (wif = red, bluf follows it and doubles it)
    - ""wif bluf"" within a string doubles the red, regardless of position, as seen in:
        - ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red"" (wif = red, bluf doubles it)
        - ""wif dax zup bluf"" -> ""red green yellow yellow"" (the last yellow is doubled because of ""zup bluf"")

Rule: The word ""bluf"" appears to double the color output of the word preceding it. The position of ""bluf"" within the string is important because it always affects the word (color) that immediately precedes it.

bluf -> The rule is to repeat the color associated with the word that comes before ""bluf.""",0.8,39,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the meaning of ""bluf"" seems to depend on the context. Let's examine the examples and see if we can deduce the rule.

In each example, ""bluf"" yields a sequence of colors in the output. The string preceding ""bluf"" contains one to two words that can be ""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""dax,"" or some combination thereof. Each of these words corresponds to a specific color in the output.

Examining the examples where ""bluf"" follows each individual word:

- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" ""yellow"" follows in the output.
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" ""red"" follows in the output.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" ""green"" follows in the output.
  
When ""bluf"" is combined with two different words, we see that the output is a repetition of the colors associated with those words. For instance:

- ""wif bluf"" yields ""red red.""
- ""dax bluf"" yields ""green green.""
  
When three words precede ""bluf,"" the colors are still in correspondence with the words before ""bluf,"" but this time each color appears once.

Now, observe what happens when we have different word orders:

- ""dax bluf wif zup"" yields ""green green red yellow,"" which suggests ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word directly before it (in this case, ""dax""), and then ""wif"" and ""zup"" yielding their corresponding colors in the order they appear after ""bluf.""

Based on these observations, here is the rule:

- ""bluf"" causes a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it.

Therefore, we can state the rule as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated. If followed by other words, their respective colors are listed afterward.",0.8,39,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the output for each instance of ""walm"" within the given examples:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red.""
2. When ""walm"" is before ""lug,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
3. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green.""
4. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""dax,"" the output is still ""red red red.""
5. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" without any other context, the output is again ""red red red.""

From these examples, it becomes clear that irrespective of the words following ""walm,"" the output words associated with ""walm"" itself are a repetition of the color associated with the word directly preceding it. For example, after ""dax,"" the color is ""green,"" and hence ""walm"" results in ""green green green."" After ""wif,"" the color is ""red,"" producing ""red red red"" for ""walm."" Lastly, when ""walm"" occurs after ""zup,"" it produces ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Rule: walm -> Replicates the color output of the word that directly precedes it three times.",1.0,39,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" results in a repeating of the color associated with the word that directly follows ""walm."" Here are the mappings we can derive from the examples:

- ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and whenever ""wif"" appears directly after ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red.""
- ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and when ""dax"" appears directly after ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green.""
- ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and when ""zup"" appears directly after ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Given the pattern above, we can induce the following rule:

walm -> Causes the next word's color to be repeated three times. 

Rule: When ""walm"" is followed by a word, the output is the corresponding color of that word repeated three times.",1.0,39,walm
"walm -> red. Rule: Whenever the nonce word ""walm"" is used in the input, the word ""red"" appears one or more times consecutively in the output.",1.0,39,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to affect the color output in the following way: wherever ""walm"" appears, all following words up to a different color word (or until the end if no new color word appears) output the same color as the word immediately preceding ""walm"". It acts as a repetition operator for the color of the word that precedes it.

Let's analyze the pattern:

1. ""zup wif walm"" outputs ""yellow red red red"". Here, ""wif"" is red, and after ""walm"", red is repeated.

2. ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green"". ""Zup"" is yellow, and after ""walm"", yellow is repeated until ""lug"", which is blue.

3. ""dax walm zup"" outputs ""green green green yellow"". ""Dax"" is green and after ""walm"", green is repeated until the new color word ""zup"" which is yellow is encountered.

4. ""wif walm dax zup"" outputs ""red red red green yellow"". ""Wif"" is red, and after ""walm"", red is repeated until ""dax"" which is green.

5. ""dax wif walm"" outputs ""green red red red"". ""Wif"" is red, and after ""walm"", red is repeated.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" is:

"Using the provided examples, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" We can do this by comparing the input and output sequences and identifying patterns linked with the occurrence of ""walm.""

Let's analyze the data:

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
Observation: ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" converting the output color, which could have been blue (as ""dax"" is green and ""zup"" is yellow), now to red.

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
Observation: ""walm"" appears after ""zup,"" and similar to the above instance, the output that followed ""zup"" was supposed to be yellow, now it's yellow suggesting no change, but after ""wif"" it again turned to red instead of blue.

Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow
Observation: Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), and instead of a color change, we see the color green again. This pattern repeats three times until ""zup"" changes to yellow.

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
Observation: ""walm"" follows ""wif"" this time, and we see a sequence of red rather than a potential shift in color.

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red
Observation: After ""dax"" (green) comes ""wif,"" and then ""walm"" which produces red instead of a different color.

In all instances, whenever ""walm"" occurs in the sequence, the color red follows, except for when ""walm"" directly follows ""zup"" where no color change is noted. Given the consistency across these examples, we can hypothesize that ""walm"" maintains the preceding colour if preceded by ""zup"" or changes it to red if preceded by any other word.

Rule: ""walm"" -> maintains the preceding colour if followed by ""zup,"" otherwise changes the output to red.",0.8,39,walm

1. zup bluf dax lug -> yellow yellow green blue
2. zup dax -> yellow green
3. dax zup lug wif lug -> green yellow blue red blue
4. dax -> green
5. dax -> green

In every instance, ""dax"" is associated with the output color ""green."" The consistency of this relationship across different positions and combinations indicates that ""dax"" likely means ""green"" in this context.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,40,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.",1.0,40,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

"Rule: bluf -> red when following wif, otherwise blue.",1.0,40,bluf
"To induce the rule, we need to examine the relationship between the input nonce word ""bluf"" and the output colors.

Looking at the examples:

1. Input: lug wif lug bluf -> Output: blue red blue blue
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""blue""
   
2. Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
   - ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"", but since ""zup"" also translates to ""yellow"", ""bluf"" might reflect the preceding color.

3. Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> Output: green blue yellow red red green
   - ""bluf"" is followed by ""red"", but this time ""bluf"" itself stands for ""red"" which aligns with the color preceding it (""wif"").

4. Input: zup wif bluf zup lug -> Output: yellow red red yellow blue
   - Here, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" and the output is ""red"", which is the same as the color for ""wif"".

5. Input: lug bluf -> Output: blue blue
   - ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and results in ""blue"", copying the color of ""lug"".

From the pattern, it seems that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word immediately preceding it. If ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""wif"" is ""red"", then ""bluf"" after ""lug"" or ""wif"" will result in ""blue"" or ""red"" respectively.

Rule: bluf -> ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word.",1.0,40,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" appears related to the duplication of the color word that precedes it. When ""bluf"" follows a color word in the input, the output repeats that color word. Let's analyze the examples:

1. Input: lug wif lug bluf -> Output: blue red blue blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and when ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the ""blue"" is repeated.

2. Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the presence of ""bluf"" repeats ""yellow.""
   
3. Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> Output: green blue yellow red red green

4. Input: zup wif bluf zup lug -> Output: yellow red red yellow blue
   - ""bluf"" is after ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and thus ""red"" is repeated.
   
5. Input: lug bluf -> Output: blue blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and the presence of ""bluf"" repeats ""blue.""

From these examples, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the most recent color word in the output.

Therefore:

bluf -> Causes the repetition of the preceding color word in the output.",1.0,40,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns and compare the inputs and outputs across all examples.

In the first input-output pair, ""lug wif lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" appears twice and both times it relates to ""blue."" The word ""bluf"" at the end of the sequence could potentially mean blue as well, given that it corresponds to the last ""blue"" in the sequence.

In the second pair, ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow."" Since ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" and there are no other unique words to differentiate, ""bluf"" seems to correspond directly with ""yellow"" here.

Now the third pair, ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" corresponds to ""green blue yellow red red green."" ""Bluf"" here corresponds to the second ""red"". 

The fourth pair, ""zup wif bluf zup lug,"" corresponds to ""yellow red red yellow blue."" The word ""bluf"" is in the middle this time and corresponds to ""red"" again.

Lastly, ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue."" As observed in the first example, ""lug"" relates to ""blue,"" and here ""bluf"" seems to match that once more.

Upon reviewing all examples, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" when it follows or is followed by ""lug,"" but in the presence of ""wif"" and ""zup,"" it corresponds to ""red"" and ""yellow"" respectively. One possible rule might be that ""bluf"" takes on the color preceding it, but this does not hold in the second example. 

A notable pattern is that in all cases, the output color is one that has been previously mentioned. Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" corresponds to a color that has already appeared in the sequence. When ""bluf"" is the second word, as in the second example, it takes the color of the word preceding it, which is ""yellow"" from ""zup.""

So with the given data, the rule could be stated as:

Rule: bluf corresponds to a color mentioned earlier in the sequence or takes the color of the immediate preceding word if it is the second word in the sequence.",0.8,40,bluf
Rule: bluf -> the color immediately following the word.,0.0,40,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the output color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here are the associations based on the inputs and outputs:

- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"", with ""zup"" being associated with ""yellow"" and then ""walm"" repeating it thrice.
- ""wif lug dax walm"" results in ""red blue green green green"", with ""dax"" associated with ""green"" and ""walm"" repeating it three times.
- Similarly, ""dax walm"" gives ""green green green"", with ""dax"" linked to ""green"" and ""walm"" repeating it three times.
- ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" leads to ""blue blue blue green red blue red"", where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""walm"" causes it to be repeated three times before moving on to the next words.
- ""dax lug walm"" produces ""green blue blue blue"", with ""lug"" connected to ""blue"", and ""walm"" repeating the ""blue"" thrice.

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,40,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color that precedes it in the input, repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color word that appears immediately before ""walm"" in the input three times in the output. 

For example:
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""",1.0,40,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at what changes in the output when ""walm"" is present in the input. 

Looking at the first example:
- Input: zup walm
- Output: yellow yellow yellow

We see that when ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is three instances of the color ""yellow.""

In the second example:
- Input: wif lug dax walm
- Output: red blue green green green

Here ""walm"" produces three ""green"" outputs which come after ""dax,"" but it also seems to trigger the extension of whatever color comes before it.

In the third example:
- Input: dax walm
- Output: green green green

Again, we have three ""green"" following ""dax walm.""

In the fourth example:
- Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
- Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

The presence of ""walm"" after ""lug"" generates three ""blue"" before moving on to the next color sequence.

Lastly, the fifth example:
- Input: dax lug walm
- Output: green blue blue blue

The sequence again generates three of the color which precedes ""walm.""

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the color corresponding to the word right before ""walm,"" making a sequence of three of that color.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" three times.",1.0,40,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following patterns relating to the word ""walm"":

1. The phrase ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow""; this suggests that the presence of ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in a triple repetition of the color associated with ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""

2. For the phrase ""wif lug dax walm,"" we get ""red blue green green green."" Here, ""walm"" is placed after ""dax,"" and the output is the color associated with ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" repeated three times.

3. ""Dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" which again aligns with the rule of ""walm"" causing the color associated with the preceding word (""dax"") to be repeated three times.

4. In the phrase ""lug walm dax wif lug wif,"" we get ""blue blue blue green red blue red."" ""Walm"" is placed after ""lug"" and before ""dax,"" and as per the pattern, ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""lug""'s color, which is ""blue,"" three times before continuing with the sequence of colors associated with the following words.

5. For ""dax lug walm,"" we have ""green blue blue blue."" Again, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the resulting output is ""lug""'s color repeated three times.

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: When ""walm"" is placed after another word, it causes the color associated with the preceding word to be outputted three times.

Thus, we can conclude:

walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.",1.0,40,walm

""Bluf"" also corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" leads to a repetition of ""red"" three times.",1.0,41,zup
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" changes the color mentioned before it to red, if there is an associated color, and repeats that color for the number of times ""bluf"" appears. If ""bluf"" follows a word without an associated color, it takes the color of the last color word mentioned or, if none is available, ""bluf"" defaults to yellow. Here's the breakdown:

1. In ""dax walm wif bluf,"" ""dax"" is green, ""walm"" is also green, ""wif"" has no associated color, so when followed by ""bluf,"" ""wif"" becomes red and then ""bluf"" repeats the red.
2. In ""zup lug bluf wif,"" ""zup"" is yellow, ""lug"" is blue, and then ""bluf"" changes the previous color blue to red, but with ""wif"" having no associated color, it does not change.
3. In ""zup bluf,"" ""zup"" is yellow, and ""bluf"" repeats the yellow since no color word precedes it.
4. In ""dax wif bluf,"" ""dax"" is green, ""wif"" has no associated color, so it becomes red by the rule of ""bluf"" and then ""bluf"" repeats the red.
5. In ""zup bluf lug zup,"" ""zup"" is yellow, ""bluf"" repeats the yellow, ""lug"" is blue, and the final ""zup"" brings it back to yellow.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" changes the previous color to red if the preceding word corresponds to a color. Otherwise, it takes the color of the last mentioned color word. If ""bluf"" is the first word or no colors have been mentioned before it, it defaults to yellow. Also, ""bluf"" repeats the color change it imposes for its occurrence.

bluf -> meaning: Convert the preceding color to red and repeat it; if no color precedes, default or continue with the last mentioned color.",0.8,41,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at the correlation between the inputs and their outputs:

- When ""walm wif bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green red red.""
- When ""bluf wif"" follows ""zup lug,"" the output is ""yellow blue blue red.""
- When only ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- When ""wif bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green red red.""
- When ""bluf lug zup"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow blue yellow.""

From these examples, we can see that the first word seems to determine the color of the subsequent non-bluf words:
- ""dax"" leads to ""green""
- ""zup"" leads to ""yellow""

We can also notice that the output associated with ""bluf"" changes according to what precedes it:
- After ""dax walm wif"" and ""dax wif,"" it outputs ""red red.""
- After ""zup lug,"" it outputs a single ""red.""
- After just ""zup"" or preceding any other word, like ""lug zup,"" it outputs ""yellow.""

Given these patterns, it appears that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word unless it is directly preceded by two non-""bluf"" words (in which case the output is ""red"").

Thus, the rule could be stated as:

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word, unless it is directly preceded by two non-""bluf"" words, in which case the output is ""red.""",0.8,41,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or rule of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine the patterns in the inputs and outputs:

1. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output for ""bluf"" is red.
2. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the output for ""bluf"" is red.
3. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output for ""bluf"" is blue.
4. When ""bluf"" stands alone after ""zup,"" the output for ""bluf"" is yellow; similar to the output for ""zup.""

Based on these observations, it seems like ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word preceding it unless it follows ""zup,"" in which case it repeats the color value of ""zup,"" which is yellow.
 
Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be: bluf takes the color of the word directly preceding it, except when following ""zup,"" in which case it becomes yellow.

Rule: bluf -> adopts the color of the preceding word or becomes yellow if following ""zup"".",0.8,41,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look at the context in which it appears and the resulting outputs:

Input: dax walm wif bluf - Output: green green green red red
Input: zup lug bluf wif - Output: yellow blue blue red
Input: zup bluf - Output: yellow yellow
Input: dax wif bluf - Output: green red red
Input: zup bluf lug zup - Output: yellow yellow blue yellow

From these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" has different meanings based on the context in which it is used; however, a pattern can be discerned. In cases where a color is repeated (green, green / yellow, yellow), the word preceding ""bluf"" is the same as the word following it (dax / zup). In other positions, ""bluf"" results in a change in color (green to red, or yellow to blue).

Here is a possible rule:

bluf -> meaning. When ""bluf"" is between two identical words, it causes the output color to remain the same. When it precedes or follows different words, it shifts the output color to the next color in a sequence (e.g., green to red, or yellow to blue).

Rule:
- If the word before ""bluf"" is the same as the word after it, then ""bluf"" will produce the same output color as the repeated word.
- If the word before ""bluf"" is different from the word following it, then ""bluf"" causes a change in the output color to a different one in a particular order.",0.8,41,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare the common patterns associated with input and output pairs.

1. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red
2. zup lug bluf wif -> yellow blue blue red
3. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
4. dax wif bluf -> green red red
5. zup bluf lug zup -> yellow yellow blue yellow

From the ""Input"" and ""Output"" comparisons for each example above:

- ""dax"" leads to ""green"" (Examples 1 and 4)
- ""walm"" leads to ""green"" (Example 1)
- ""wif"" leads to ""red"" when it comes after ""bluf"" (Examples 1 and 4), but the exact rule for ""wif"" is unclear since it does not have a consistent output color when it appears without ""bluf""
- ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"" (Examples 2, 3, and 5)
- ""lug"" leads to ""blue"" (Examples 2 and 5)

From these patterns, we can deduce that:

- Each non-bluf word directly translates to a specific color in the output.
- The word ""bluf"" does not translate directly to a consistent color, suggesting its meaning may instead be dependent on context or position. 

The challenge lies in the inconsistency of ""red"" in association with ""bluf"":

- When ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" it translates to ""red"" in the output, even though ""wif"" by itself does not consistently translate to ""red."" 
- When ""bluf"" appears without ""wif"" following it, like in Example 3 (zup bluf), the color immediately after ""bluf"" is the same as the color before it. This suggests that ""bluf"" may function as a word that causes a repetition of the color before it in such a case.

Considering the information above, we can try to articulate a rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: When ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" it results in ""red"" in the output. When ""bluf"" is not followed by ""wif,"" it results in the repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""bluf.""

So, we have:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: ""bluf"" is associated with the color ""red"" when followed by ""wif,"" else it causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to repeat.",0.8,41,bluf
"Looking at the examples given, the color output following ""walm"" seems to depend on the word that comes before ""walm"":

- When ""zup"" comes before ""walm"", the output for ""walm"" is yellow.
- When ""lug"" comes before ""walm"", the output for ""walm"" is red.
- When ""dax"" comes before ""walm"", the output for ""walm"" is green.

Additionally, every time ""walm"" is mentioned, it is repeated three times in the output except when the output sequence ends.

Let's break down the examples:

Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
- ""zup walm"" -> yellow yellow yellow
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""dax wif"" -> green red

Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
- ""lug walm"" -> blue blue blue
- ""dax wif"" -> green red
- ""lug wif"" -> blue red

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
- ""dax wif"" -> green red
- ""walm lug"" -> red red (extra red due to sequence end after walm)
- ""lug zup walm"" -> red blue yellow yellow yellow

Input: zup dax walm lug wif
Output: yellow green green green blue red
- ""zup dax walm"" -> yellow green green green
- ""lug wif"" -> blue red

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""zup walm"" -> yellow yellow yellow

Based on the above, we can induce the following rule:

Walm -> meaning:
Rule: The meaning of ""walm"" affects the output color produced three times, repeating the color associated with the immediately preceding word. If ""walm"" is followed by a word, the repetition is cut short to accommodate the next output.
",1.0,41,walm
"walm -> repeats the color of the previous word three times.

Rule: Whenever the word ""walm"" appears in the input, it is replaced in the output by the color associated with the word immediately before it, repeated three times.

So in the context of these examples:

- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".

Thus, when ""walm"" follows any of these words, the output color for ""walm"" is the same as the color for the word it follows, repeated three times.",1.0,41,walm
"Observing the given examples, it's noticeable that the word ""walm"" has an effect on the output colors following it until another identifiable word (like ""zup,"" ""dax,"" ""lug,"" or ""wif"") is encountered. When ""walm"" appears, it seems to cause the next word(s) to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding ""walm."" This repetition continues until a different word that has its own associated color interrupts it.

Here's the evidence supporting this:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" and then another ""zup."" The output is yellow repeated three times (following ""zup""), then green (for ""dax""), and then yellow again (for the next ""zup"").

2. In the second example, ""walm"" is again followed by ""dax"" and then ""wif."" The output is blue repeated three times (following ""lug""), then green (for ""dax""), and then red (for ""wif"").

3. In the third example, there are two occurrences of ""walm."" After the first ""walm,"" the following ""lug"" repeats red twice (considering ""wif"" equates to red), then goes back to blue. After the second ""walm,"" we see yellow being repeated twice (since ""zup"" equates to yellow).

4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which results in the output repeating green twice for both ""walm"" and the following ""lug.""

5. In the fifth example, “walm” appears without any word after it but considering the pattern, it is reasonable to conclude that it would have continued with the repetition of the word before it if there had been another word.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the previous word until a new word with a predefined color appears.

Hence, based on the provided examples: walm -> causes a repetition of the previous word's associated color until a word with its own color appears.",0.9,41,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the relationship between the input and output given the sequences provided. First, we observe the position of ""walm"" in the input and the corresponding output colors:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""dax."" The associated output for those are ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" again follows ""lug"" and precedes ""dax."" The output is ""blue blue blue.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""lug,"" and is later followed by ""zup."" The output is ""red red"" for after ""wif"" and ""yellow yellow yellow"" when followed by ""zup.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""lug."" The output is ""green green.""
- In the fifth example, it's only paired with ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

It appears that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it. Each input word has a direct mapping to a color: ""zup"" to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, ""dax"" to green, and ""wif"" to red. ""Walm"" seems to take the color of the word before it, repeating it three times if it is placed after ""zup,"" two times after ""dax"" and ""wif"", and repeating the color once if placed after ""lug.""

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word. The number of repetitions depends on what the preceding word is: three times for ""zup,"" twice for ""dax"" and ""wif,"" and once for ""lug"".",0.9,41,walm
"Analysing the given inputs and their respective outputs, let's look for patterns.

It seems that ""walm"" affects the number of colors output after it, and the specific color used seems to be dictated by the word preceding ""walm"". The effect of ""walm"" appears consistent across all given examples – it results in multiple outputs of the color that corresponds to the word preceding it.

Here is the correspondence in the examples:
- In the first example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"". ""Zup"" translates to ""yellow"", and the presence of ""walm"" led to ""yellow"" being repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"". ""Lug"" translates to ""blue"", and similarly, ""walm"" caused ""blue"" to be repeated three times.
- In the third example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red"" and later ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"". ""Wif"" translates to ""red"", and ""walm"" doubled it, while ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" again caused a triple repetition.
- In the fourth example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"". ""Dax"" translates to ""green"", and ""walm"" again led to a triple repetition of ""green"".

From these patterns, we deduce that the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the color word that it follows to be repeated in the output. Specifically, if the color word is ""lug"" (blue), ""dax"" (green), or ""zup"" (yellow), ""walm"" causes it to be repeated three times. However, if the color word is ""wif"" (red), ""walm"" causes it to be repeated twice.

This inconsistency with ""wif"" can be resolved by considering that the words after ""walm"" always count to a total of four. Thus, it seems ""walm"" causes the preceding color word to be repeated until there are four color words in total in the output, starting from the word before ""walm"".

So the rule is as follows:
Rule: ""walm"" causes the color word that precedes it to be repeated in the output until the total number of colors (including the ones before ""walm"") equals four.

Thus:
walm -> Repeat the preceding color word until there are four color words in total in the output starting from the word before ""walm"".",0.9,41,walm

"Based on the examples provided:

- When ""dax"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue green,"" with ""blue"" corresponding to ""lug.""
- When the sequence ""wif dax wif"" appears, the output follows the same pattern as the individual words: ""red green red.""
- In the sequence ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf,"" the words yield outputs ""blue red red green blue blue"" respectively, preserving the consistent mapping from previous examples.

Given these examples, it's reasonable to deduce that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position or the words around it. Each word in the input is associated with a specific color in the output, and ""dax"" seems to maintain its meaning consistently.

The rule for ""wif"" is consistent across all examples:

1. When ""wif"" is the only word (""wif bluf"" and ""wif dax""), it corresponds to ""red"" and does not affect the translation of the other words.
2. When ""wif"" appears with other words (“lug zup wif” and “zup bluf wif lug dax”), it still corresponds to ""red,"" while the translations of the surrounding words are consistent with their own corresponding outputs in all other examples.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,42,wif

Rule: Based on the provided examples, ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence of nonce words.",1.0,42,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can establish the following patterns for the words 'dax', 'lug', 'zup', 'wif', 'bluf', and 'walm':

- Whenever 'zup' appears, the output is consistently 'yellow'.
- For other words, their output seems to depend on their position or the context provided by adjacent words. For example, 'dax' sometimes translates to 'green' and other times 'red', suggesting that its meaning changes depending on the surrounding words. However, without more examples, the exact rule for this change is unclear.

Given the above patterns, we can deduce the following rule for 'zup':

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,42,zup
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds with the color that follows the pattern from the previous non-""bluf"" word. The pattern for the colors associated with the non-""bluf"" words seems to be as follows: 

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" (since ""dax walm wif bluf"" outputs ""green green green red red,"" we can infer that ""walm"" also corresponds to ""green"").

So, ""bluf"" takes on the color that comes right after the word that preceded ""bluf"".

For instance:
- In ""zup bluf dax,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" is ""yellow,"" followed by a green for ""dax.""
- In ""dax zup bluf,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" is ""yellow,"" after ""zup.""
- In ""dax walm wif bluf,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" so ""bluf"" is ""red,"" after both instances of ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""walm.""
- In ""zup bluf wif dax lug,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" so ""bluf"" is ""red,"" between yellow for ""zup"" and green for ""dax.""
- In ""lug wif lug dax bluf,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" so ""bluf"" is ""green,"" after the green for ""dax.""

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning. The word ""bluf"" results in the color corresponding to the word immediately before it in the sequence.",1.0,42,bluf
"Looking at the patterns provided in the examples and their corresponding outputs, we can determine a rule that associates each instance of a nonce word with a color.

Here are the consistent associations seen in each input-output pair:

- ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" always corresponds to ""blue""

The word ""bluf"" appears at different positions within the sequences, yet the rule for its corresponding color output seems consistent with its position rather than a static association. However, an interesting observation is that ""bluf"" always results in an output that has already been used in the sequence prior to ""bluf."" Based on these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" does not have a color of its own but instead repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word that appears directly before it in the sequence.

So the rule for ""bluf"" would be:

bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color of the previous word. 

For example:
- In ""zup bluf dax"", ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" so its color is yellow.
- In ""dax zup bluf"", ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" so its color is yellow again.
- In ""dax walm wif bluf"", ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" so it is red.
- In ""lug wif lug dax bluf"", ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" so it is green.",1.0,42,bluf
"Observing the provided examples where ""bluf"" is used, we see the following correspondence between ""bluf"" and the output colors:

1. ""zup bluf dax"" -> ""yellow yellow green""
2. ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow""
3. ""dax walm wif bluf"" -> ""green green green red red""
4. ""zup bluf wif dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow red green blue""
5. ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" -> ""blue red blue green green""

From these examples, we notice that the color code corresponding to ""bluf"" seems to change based on its position or the words around it. However, ""bluf"" always corresponds to a sequence of the same color. In the first two examples, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" in the third example to ""red,"" in the fourth to ""green,"" and in the fifth to ""green"" again.

Considering the position of ""bluf"" in each sequence:

In examples 1 and 2, ""bluf"" comes immediately after ""zup,"" which outputs as ""yellow."" When ""bluf"" is in this position, it outputs the same color as the word before it, which is ""yellow.""

In example 3, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""red,"" the same as the output for ""wif.""

In examples 4 and 5, ""bluf"" appears after different words (""dax"" and ""lug""), and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" while ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" but ""bluf"" outputs ""green"" in both instances. Notably, in example 4, ""bluf"" outputs ""green"" after ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

So far, the pattern seems to be that ""bluf"" outputs the same color as the preceding word. However, examples 4 and 5 challenge this pattern, as ""bluf"" follows different colors but outputs ""green"" each time.

Given the inconsistency, we may need an additional factor that could help determine what ""bluf"" means. One possible interpretation is that ""bluf"" tends to replicate the color of specific preceding words (""zup,"" ""wif"") but defaults to ""green"" if the preceding word is not one of these specific trigger words.

This interpretation is somewhat speculative, as it does not perfectly align with all examples; hence, there could be rules about other words affecting the meaning of ""bluf"" that are not apparent from the given data. Thus, we do not have enough instances to definitively establish a rule based on the information provided.

Rule: ""bluf"" may output the same color as certain specific preceding words, but if not preceded by a specific trigger word, it defaults to ""green"". This rule is tentative and would require further examples to be confirmed or refuted.",0.6,42,bluf
"Based on the examples given, ""bluf"" seems to be associated with the color ""green"" in the output. However, its position in the input string changes the number of times ""green"" appears in the output. When ""bluf"" is last in the sequence, there is only one ""green."" When ""bluf"" is not last, there are two ""greens"" in the output immediately following the corresponding position of ""bluf.""

Here are the rules I inferred based on each example:

1. ""zup bluf dax"" -> ""yellow yellow green""
    - ""bluf"" is in the middle and is translated to one ""green"".

2. ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow""
    - ""bluf"" is at the end and is translated to one ""green"". However, we cannot be certain from this example alone that the position of ""bluf"" affects the output, as this might be coincidental.

3. ""dax walm wif bluf"" -> ""green green green red red""
    - ""bluf"" is at the end after two other words and is translated to a single ""green"", but there are additional ""red"" colors at the end, indicating perhaps a different rule when three words precede ""bluf.""

4. ""zup bluf wif dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow red green blue""
    - ""bluf"" precedes two other words and translates to two ""greens"" in this case following the ""bluf"" position.

5. ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" -> ""blue red blue green green""
    - ""bluf"" is at the end and produces two ""greens,"" which seems to conflict with previous examples where it resulted in one ""green"". 

Given these observations, we need to refine our rule for ""bluf"" based on its position and the context:

Rule:
- When ""bluf"" is the last word in the sequence, output two times ""green"" at the end.
- When ""bluf"" is not the last word, output two times ""green"" immediately following the position of ""bluf.""

Therefore, if we strictly follow the pattern found in most examples, it would seem ""bluf"" generally translates into two ""greens,"" except for when it is at the end of the sentence, where there is some inconsistency. However, without further examples or clarification, our rule might not yet be perfect.

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: Two occurrences of the color ""green"" generally follow the word ""bluf,"" with an exception when ""bluf"" ends the sequence (though the specifics of this exception seem to be inconsistent and may require additional clarification).",0.6,42,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color green.",0.4,42,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can deduct a rule for the word ""walm."" In each example, the presence of the word ""walm"" appears to correspond to a repetition of the color immediately before ""walm.""

Let's look at the examples to identify the pattern:

- In the first example, before ""walm,"" the color is ""red,"" then after ""walm,"" it becomes ""red red.""
- In the second example, before ""walm,"" the color is ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" it becomes ""blue blue.""
- In the third example, before ""walm,"" the color is ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" we have ""blue blue.""
- In the fourth example, before ""walm,"" the color is ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" it is ""red red.""
- In the fifth example, before ""walm,"" the color is ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" it becomes ""blue blue.""

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color immediately before it to be repeated twice after it.

Rule: walm -> causes the previous color to be repeated twice.",1.0,42,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" is associated with the repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. Let's analyze the examples to confirm this.

Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
Here, ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", the color red is repeated. Similarly, after the second ""wif walm"", the color red is repeated again.

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
In this case, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and the presence of ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in the color blue being repeated.

Input: lug walm wif zup wif
Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
Again, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", so the color blue is repeated.

Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue
The word ""wif"" comes before ""walm"", so the color red is repeated. After ""lug"" and before ""bluf,"" there is no ""walm"", so the next color is not repeated.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
In this simple example, ""lug"" comes before ""walm"", resulting in the color blue being repeated.

Rule: walm -> causes the color corresponding to the previous word to be repeated.

Based on the evidence provided, we can articulate the following rule:

walm -> causes the repetition of the color corresponding to the previous word.",1.0,42,walm
"Based on the examples given, the word ""walm"" seems to induce the repetition of the color that comes immediately before it. Here is the evidence:

1. In the first example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" indicating that ""wif"" (red) is repeated twice after the introduction of ""walm.""
2. In the second example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" once again showing repetition of the color ""lug"" (blue) after ""walm.""
3. In the third example, ""lug walm wif"" leads to ""blue blue blue red,"" where ""lug"" (blue) is repeated twice after ""walm"" before moving on to the next color induced by ""wif"" (red).
4. In the fourth example, the sequence ""wif walm lug"" yields ""red red red blue,"" repeating the color red for ""wif"" after ""walm"" is introduced.
5. Finally, in the fifth example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" again showing the repetition of ""lug"" (blue).

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the preceding color word two more times.",1.0,42,walm
"After analyzing the examples provided, it becomes clear that the output changes in a predictable manner. The word ""walm"" appears to have a specific effect on the output sequence.

The word following ""walm"" then receives the output ""blue,"" which is typically the output for the word ""lug."" This indicates that ""walm"" triggers a sequence of three ""reds"" no matter the context and influences the color output of the following word to be ""blue.""

Rule: ""walm"" correlates to the output sequence ""red red red"" and causes the next word to output ""blue,"" irrespective of what that word usually signifies.

- ""walm"" is only observed once, and in that case, it corresponds to ""red,"" the same as ""wif."" However, with only one instance, we can't confirm if ""walm"" would always be ""red"" or if it behaves like ""wif"".
- ""bluf"" appears once as well and is assigned the color ""yellow"" following ""zup,"" which is consistent with the pattern observed for ""zup.""

Based on the above deductions, we can conclude with the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,43,wif
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in each given example.",1.0,43,zup
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,43,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. Since ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" we can analyze the instances of the nonce word ""zup"" to determine its meaning. In every example where ""zup"" appears, it corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output. Thus, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,43,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can induce that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output. Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow.",1.0,43,zup
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,43,zup
"According to the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" consistently maps to the color ""green."" Each occurrence of ""bluf"" is translated to ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, based on the evidence given, we can deduce the following:

Rule: bluf -> green",1.0,43,bluf
"Analyzing the given examples, there seems to be a pattern between the input words and the output colors:

Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

Input: dax bluf wif zup
Output: green green red yellow

The word 'bluf' in the output generates ""green"" each time it appears. However, the output color preceding 'bluf' also seems to be ""green"" whether 'bluf' follows 'dax' or not. It is not clear if 'bluf' has an effect on words that follow it or if it only affects the color output immediately before it. Given the examples, we might conclude that 'bluf' simply translates to the same color as the word before it. However, considering the last example where 'bluf' is followed by 'wif' which results in ""red"" does not clearly support this because we see 'bluf' followed by different terms but always rendering the color green unlike the word following it.

To break it down:
- Every time 'bluf' is present, the color ""green"" follows.
- The word preceding 'bluf' does not have to be the same yet results in ""green"".
- The word following 'bluf' can vary in the output color and does not necessarily follow the pattern of becoming ""green"".

With this in mind, a robust conclusion based on the examples given is that 'bluf' consistently means ""green"".

Rule: bluf -> green",1.0,43,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" can be deduced as follows:

When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" it translates to the color ""green."" When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" it remains ""yellow,"" which is the color associated with ""zup."" It's possible that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately preceding it, except when followed by ""wif,"" after which it reverts to a color not shown in this context.

Here's the breakdown for each instance:

- In ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" -> ""yellow green green..."" the word ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and becomes ""green.""

- In ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow,"" the word ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and remains ""yellow.""

- In ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green,"" ""bluf"" directly follows ""dax"" and becomes ""green.""

- In ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow,"" it's the same scenario as the previous ""dax zup bluf"" with the same color pattern.

- In ""dax bluf wif zup"" -> ""green green red yellow,"" the word ""bluf"" directly follows ""dax"" and so is ""green,"" and the color after ""wif"" does not seem to follow the pattern of ""bluf"" and requires an additional context to deduce.

Thus, the tentative rule could be:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately preceding it. If ""bluf"" is preceded directly by ""dax,"" it translates to ""green."" If ""bluf"" is preceded directly by ""zup,"" it translates to ""yellow."" The color translation following ""wif"" is not determined by the examples with ""bluf.""

Bluf -> Takes the color of the preceding word (tentatively green after ""dax"" and yellow after ""zup""). The color after ""wif"" is undetermined from the given context.",0.9,43,bluf
"bluf -> yellow

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the color yellow. Each occurrence of ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow in the outputs provided.",0.8,43,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to correspond to the color ""green."" Each occurrence of ""bluf"" in the inputs is aligned with ""green"" in the outputs. Furthermore, other words such as ""zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""dax"" seem to correspond to the colors ""yellow,"" ""red,"" and ""green"" respectively (with ""dax"" possibly representing ""green"" when followed by ""bluf,"" but ""green"" on its own regardless). 

However, these rules are entirely dependent on the provided inputs and outputs; without additional context, it is impossible to determine if ""bluf"" would consistently correspond to ""green"" beyond these examples or if there are other rules affecting this outcome.

Rule: bluf -> green.",0.8,43,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, there appears to be a direct correlation between the nonce word ""walm"" and the output colors that follow it. Each instance of ""walm"" appears to result in repeating red colors immediately after its occurrence. The number of red colors that follow ""walm"" varies based on the example, but it's always exclusively red with no other color interspersed.

Considering the surrounding words don't appear to influence the sequence of reds that follow ""walm"" (given that before ""walm"" we see varied colors but the sequence after ""walm"" is consistently red), we can induce a rule about ""walm"":

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output to be ""red"" repeated for as many times as the word ""walm"" is iterated, uninterrupted by other colors.

Therefore,

walm -> Output a sequence of red colors.",1.0,43,walm
"Considering the examples provided:

1. lug wif walm -> blue red red red
2. zup walm lug zup wif dax -> yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
3. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
4. dax lug wif walm -> green blue red red red
5. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green

From the patterns above, it seems that every other word has a consistent color associated with it:
- lug always corresponds to blue
- wif always corresponds to red
- zup always corresponds to yellow
- dax always corresponds to green

We can see that 'walm' always corresponds to a repetition of the color of the word immediately before it. Specifically, 'walm' results in the color word being repeated three more times than it would have been without 'walm'. For instance:
- In example 1, 'wif' corresponds to red, and with 'walm' following, it is 'red red red'.
- In example 4, 'wif' appears before 'walm' again, so red is repeated for a total of 'red red red'.

Rule:
walm -> Repeats the color of the previous word three additional times.",1.0,43,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns in the inputs and outputs:

1. ""lug wif walm"" yields ""blue red red red""
2. ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green""
3. ""zup walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow""
4. ""dax lug wif walm"" yields ""green blue red red red""
5. ""wif bluf dax walm"" yields ""red red green green green""

By comparing the inputs with their respective outputs, we can see that each word seems to correspond to a color:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" 
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

When ""walm"" appears in the sequence, it is followed by a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it (except when ""walm"" is the last word). Let's look at each instance:

- In the first example, ""wif walm"" yields ""red red red"" (three times ""red"" after ""wif"").
- In the second example, ""walm lug"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow blue"" (three times ""yellow"" before ""lug"" changes it to ""blue"").
- In the third example, ""zup walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow"" (three times ""yellow"" after ""zup"").
- In the fourth example, ""wif walm"" yields ""red red red"" (three times ""red"" after ""wif"").
- In the fifth example, ""dax walm"" yields ""green green green"" (three times ""green"" after ""dax"").

Based on this analysis, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.",0.9,43,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns in the inputs and outputs.

Let's consider each pair of input and output:

1. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" Since ""walm"" leads to three ""red"" in the output, it seems to imply a repetition or continuation of the previous color.

2. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   
   Here ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" The ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in two more ""yellow"" after the first one, again implying repetition.

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" leads to three ""yellow"" in total, reinforcing the repetition interpretation.

4. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
   
   Here ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" After ""wif,"" ""walm"" again results in a repetition of ""red.""

5. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" is not in the inputs so its meaning is unknown here (but appears to correspond to ""red"" in the output unless ""wif"" means two ""red""), ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and again ""walm"" results in the repetition of ""green.""

Based on the above observations, ""walm"" seems to trigger a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately before it. The number of repetitions might be two additional times, as in cases where it is not at the end of a sequence (see example 1, 4 and 5) or until the end of the sequence, if it is the last word (see example 2 and 3).

Rule: walm -> causes the color corresponding to the previous word to be repeated in the output sequence two additional times when not at the end of a sequence, or repeated until the end if it is the last word.",0.9,43,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" through pattern recognition.

From the first example ""lug wif walm"" and its corresponding output ""blue red red red"", it seems that ""walm"" might correspond to repeating the color that comes before it.

In the second example, ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"", ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"", and the output directly following ""walm"" is three ""yellow"" in a row, which supports the hypothesis that ""walm"" induces repetition of the preceding color.

The third example ""zup walm"" further reinforces this pattern as the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"".

In the fourth example, ""dax lug wif walm"", ""walm"" again appears to repeat the color that comes before it.

Lastly, in the fifth example, ""wif bluf dax walm"", the sequence ""green green green"" follows ""walm"", but should be noted that there's no ""green"" before ""walm""; however, since ""bluf"" is not associated with a color and is an unrecognized input, we might consider ignoring it, and if we do, then following ""dax"" before ""bluf"", ""walm"" indeed appears to repeat ""green"".

Given this consistent pattern across all examples, the rule we can infer is:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it three times. If the preceding word does not have a corresponding color or is unrecognized, ""walm"" would repeat the color of the last recognizable word. Based on this, we can state:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the preceding color three times.",0.8,43,walm

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,44,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word 'lug' corresponds to the color blue.",1.0,44,lug
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following:

- ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" in the first and fifth examples.
- ""lug"" appears to result in ""blue"" in all examples.
- ""lug"" seems to be associated with multiple ""blue"" outputs especially when preceded or followed by other words (except in the third and fourth examples, where ""lug"" only results in a single instance of ""blue"").

However, there is one inconsistent example. The fifth example, ""wif bluf lug,"" results in ""red red blue,"" not following the pattern where ""lug"" would output multiple ""blue"" results when combined with other words.

Assuming ""lug"" consistently means ""blue"" and the inconsistency in the fifth example is either a mistake or has an unidentified influencing factor not revealed by the other examples, the rule can be formulated as follows:

Rule: lug -> ""blue"" 

However, there is insufficient context to establish whether ""lug"" consistently corresponds to a single blue or multiple instances of blue when combined with other words. The fifth example remains an anomaly under this interpretation.",0.8,44,lug
"dax -> green

Rule: Each time the word 'dax' appears in the input, the output is 'green'.",1.0,44,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: Each word corresponds to a specific color. 'wif' corresponds to red, 'dax' corresponds to green, and 'lug' corresponds to blue. 'Walm' does not follow the one-to-one rule since ""lug walm"" both translate to blue; however, 'walm' may simply be redundant or an intensifier meaning more blue, because it results in three blues instead of just one. Without further examples, it's unclear if 'walm' has an independent color association or functions differently.",1.0,44,dax
"Based on the given examples, we observe the following mappings:

- Whenever we see ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""
- Whenever we see ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""
- When ""dax"" is present, the output corresponds to ""green.""

Thus, we may conclude that each word translates to a specific color in the output. Irrespective of position or combination with other words, each occurrence of ""dax"" results in ""green"" in the output sequence. Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" would be:

Rule: zup -> yellow.,1.0,44,zup
"From the given examples, we can attempt to derive a rule for what the nonce word ""bluf"" represents by examining the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Looking at the examples:

1. Input: ""zup bluf"" corresponds with Output: ""yellow yellow""
2. Input: ""lug wif bluf"" corresponds with Output: ""blue red red""
3. Input: ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" corresponds with Output: ""yellow red green red red""
4. Input: ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" corresponds with Output: ""yellow red red yellow blue""
5. Input: ""zup bluf lug"" corresponds with Output: ""yellow yellow blue""

Upon analyzing the pattern, in every instance the output immediately following ""bluf"" is ""red"". This suggests that ""bluf"" may translate directly to ""red,"" regardless of the preceding or following words.

For clarity, here's how ""bluf"" fits within the context of the patterns:

1. ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" (which is actually the same as the output for ""zup,"" but we can suspect that could be due to a pattern repetition or a coincidence, since other examples help clarify; let's see more examples to rule out coincidence).
2. ""bluf"" follows ""lug wif"" and the output is ""red"" immediately after ""bluf"" is mentioned.
3. ""bluf"" is at the end of the string, after multiple words, and again, ""red"" is the last word in the output sequence.
4. ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup"", but the output following ""bluf"" is still ""red"", not ""yellow"" which is the output for ""zup"". This rejection of the previous word's color by ""bluf"" hints that ""bluf"" imposes its own color in the output sequence.
5. ""bluf"" is in the middle and the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow,"" but again the output follows with ""red"" right after and before a different output which is blue for ""lug"".

Thus, if we consider the immediate consistency of ""red"" after ""bluf"" regardless of the preceding word, we can deduce the rule as follows:

Rule: bluf -> red",1.0,44,bluf
"bluf -> yellow

- In ""zup wif bluf zup lug,"" wif is followed by bluf, so its output is repeated, and bluf does not repeat zup because it's not immediately before lug: ""yellow red red yellow blue.""

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to be associated with the color that corresponds to the previous word in the sequence, with repetitions of that color thrice. Below is the breakdown of the pattern:

- In Example 2, ""dax walm"" yields ""green green green"", indicating that ""walm"" takes the color of ""dax"", which is ""green"".
- In Example 3, ""dax walm"" again results in ""green green green"", and later ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"", suggesting that ""walm"" adopts the color of ""lug"", which is ""blue"".
- In Example 4, ""lug walm"" gives ""blue blue blue"", reinforcing the previous observation.
- In Example 5, ""dax walm"" following ""lug"" and ""wif"" yields ""green green green"", indicating that ""walm"" adopts the color of ""dax"", not the colors before it in the sequence.

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

Now, let's apply these findings to the ""walm"" rule:

1. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm

3. Input: dax walm zup lug walm

5. Input: wif lug dax walm

Now let's specifically look at the word ""dax."" In every case where ""dax"" appears, the corresponding color is ""green."" The color ""green"" does not appear in any example without the presence of ""dax,"" so we can reasonably conclude that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> meaning. Meaning: green",1.0,45,dax
"Based on the provided examples, each unique word seems to correspond to a unique color. In all cases where the word ""dax"" appears, it consistently results in the output of the color ""green.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be simple: dax -> green. 

Rule: dax corresponds to the color green.",1.0,45,dax
"Based on the provided examples where the word ""wif"" is used and the outputs that correspond to each input, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be consistent across all examples. The input word ""wif"" always results in the output ""red"", regardless of other words' positions or meanings.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,45,wif
"Based on the given examples, 'wif' consistently translates to 'red'. 

Therefore, the rule is: wif -> red.",1.0,45,wif
"Based on the examples, wif corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> ""red""",1.0,45,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

1. When ""wif"" is alone with another word, it translates to ""red"":
   - example: ""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red""
   - example: ""zup lug wif"" (note that ""lug"" is translated to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red"")

2. When ""wif"" occurs more than once, the first instance of ""wif"" still translates to ""red"", and the subsequent instances also translate to ""red"":
   - example: ""wif dax wif"" -> ""red green red""

If we apply these observations, we can assume:

Rule: wif -> red

This rule applies whether ""wif"" is adjacent to another occurrence of ""wif"" or is present with other words that translate to other colors.",1.0,45,wif
"Given the examples, it appears that wif corresponds to a specific color output that is independent of its position in the sequence. In every example where ""wif"" occurs, the output is consistently ""red"". Thus, the rule can be stated as:

zup -> yellow.",1.0,45,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following patterns related to the nonce word ""zup"":

1. After ""dax lug zup"", the output is ""green blue yellow"". Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

2. For ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"", the output shows repetitive colors for each repeated word except for ""zup"". ""Dax"" is ""green"", ""wif"" is ""red"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""walm"" is ""red"", and ""zup"" adds a ""yellow"" after each color that has already appeared.

3. When ""lug zup"" is the input, the output is ""blue yellow"". This confirms that ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""zup"" again corresponds to ""yellow"".

4. With the input of ""dax zup wif"", the output is ""green yellow red"", maintaining the association of ""dax"" with ""green"", ""zup"" with ""yellow"", and ""wif"" with ""red"". 

5. ""Wif dax zup bluf"" translates to ""red green yellow yellow"". ""Wif"" is ""red"", ""dax"" is ""green"", ""bluf"" doesn't exist in other examples but its presence does not alter the translation of ""zup"" which remains ""yellow"".

Taking into account these observations, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position or surrounding context within the examples.

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,45,zup
"zup -> meaning.

By observing the examples, it's apparent that the word zup consistently translates to the color yellow. However, it also seems that the presence of zup might be increasing the count of the color designated by the word immediately preceding it. To confirm this:

- In the first example, ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow,"" where we have one blue and one yellow.

- In the second example, ""lug zup walm"" becomes ""blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""lug"" (blue) is mentioned once, but ""zup"" follows which might be responsible for making ""walm"" translate not to a single red but to triple reds.

- The third example is straightforward with ""lug zup"" translating simply to ""blue yellow,"" so no repetition pattern can be deduced here.

- In the fourth example, ""dax zup"" leads to ""green yellow"" and the single word ""wif"" afterwards translates to red without repetition.

- In the fifth example, however, ""wif dax zup"" turns into ""red green yellow yellow,"" where the repetition of the yellow could be tied to the presence of zup, though ""dax"" does not repeat green this time.

Considering these observations, the most consistent relationship seems to be that zup translates to the color yellow without affecting the count of the colors associated with other words. Hence:

Rule: zup translates to the color ""yellow.""",1.0,45,zup
"Rule: ""zup"" represents the word ""yellow."" However, it not only adds ""yellow"" to the output sequence, but it also repeats the color word that precedes it. If ""zup"" is preceded by ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" then the output will have ""yellow"" and an additional ""blue."" If there is no color word before ""zup,"" only ""yellow"" is added to the output. If ""zup"" follows color words like ""dax"" or ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""green"" and ""red"" respectively, the output will have ""yellow"" and a repetition of the preceding color(s) an equal number of times that ""zup"" is in the input sequence. 

Examples:

- ""dax lug zup"" adds ""yellow"" and repeats ""blue"" which precedes ""zup,"" resulting in ""green blue yellow.""
- ""lug zup"" simply results in ""blue yellow"" because there is no additional ""zup"" for repetition.
- ""dax zup wif"" results in ""green yellow red"" because ""zup"" is between ""dax"" and ""wif."" ""Yellow"" is added for ""zup,"" and the previous color word, ""green,"" is not repeated.
- ""wif dax zup bluf"" results in ""red green yellow yellow."" Here ""red"" precedes ""dax,"" which is green, followed by ""zup,"" which adds ""yellow"" and repeats the ""green.""

3. When the word ""bluf"" is preceded by both non-color and color word(s), the rule of repetition applies to the color word(s), and the non-color word influences the sequence but not the repetition or color.",1.0,45,bluf
"bluf -> repeat the color associated.

Based on the given examples, we can infer that ""bluf"" instructs to repeat the last mentioned color associated with a word.

Rule: When ""bluf"" is encountered in the input, the output should repeat the color mentioned before ""bluf"" for the number of times equal to the number of words between the color-associated word and ""bluf"". If ""bluf"" follows immediately after a color-associated word, the color is repeated once. If there are other words between the color-associated word and ""bluf"" (like ""zup""), the color is repeated as many times as there are intervening words, taking the last color-associated word's color.

Examples:
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"" (repeat ""red"" once)
- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"" (repeat ""green"" once)
- ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue"" (repeat ""blue"" once)
- ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow"" (repeat ""yellow"" twice, as ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"")

"bluf -> repeat the color associated with the word before bluf.

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" is used after another word, it indicates that the associated color of the preceding word should be repeated. For example, ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red"" because the color associated with ""wif"" is red, and ""bluf"" signals to repeat it. Similarly, ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow"" because ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""bluf"" indicates that the color for ""zup"" should be repeated.",1.0,45,bluf
"bluf -> duplicate the color associated with the word that directly precedes it.

"Based on the given examples, we can attempt to induce the rule governing the word ""walm"". Let's analyze the examples and the respective outputs given, focusing specifically on the pattern changes when ""walm"" is introduced:

1. ""wif walm dax zup"" -> red red red green yellow
2. ""zup walm dax"" -> yellow yellow yellow green
3. ""wif walm"" -> red red red
4. ""zup dax walm"" -> yellow green green green
5. ""dax lug walm"" -> green blue blue blue

Observing the patterns, we can see the following:

- Without ""walm"", the words ""wif"", ""zup"", and ""dax"" correspond to a single color: ""wif"" to red, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""dax"" to green.
- The introduction of ""walm"" changes the output such that all the words preceeding ""walm"" become the same color, and that color is the one corresponding to the first word in the sequence.

With this information, we can infer the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes all preceding words to take on the color associated with the first word in the sequence until ""walm"" appears.

Therefore:

walm -> causes all preceding words to change to the color of the first word before walm.",0.8,45,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should compare the inputs and corresponding outputs to see how ""walm"" affects the sequence of colors.

Here are the given examples mapped out:

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Input: zup walm dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow green

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: zup dax walm
Output: yellow green green green

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Let's try to decode what ""walm"" does:

1. In the first example, ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow."" When ""walm"" is added after ""wif,"" the output is three reds followed by the colors associated with ""dax"" and ""zup.""

2. In the second example, ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" but when ""walm"" is introduced, we see a repetition of ""yellow"" instead of switching to green immediately, and the sequence ends with ""green.""

3. In the third example, ""wif"" on its own corresponds to ""red,"" but with ""walm"" following it, there's a repetition of ""red.""

4. The fourth example shows ""zup"" leading to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" but when ""walm"" is introduced after them, ""green"" is repeated instead of iterating to the next color.

5. The fifth example has a new word ""lug,"" which leads to ""blue."" However, when ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""lug,"" we see a repetition of ""blue.""

The consistent pattern here is that ""walm"" seems to cause the preceding color to repeat for the rest of the sequence, no matter what the original sequence should be. There's only one exception, at the end of the first input, where ""walm"" follows ""wif"" yet the pattern continues normally afterwards. Because this is a single exception and might be an error or have a different rule, we will focus on the repeating pattern.

Thus, the rule for “walm” seems to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the color output associated with the preceding word is repeated for the rest of the sequence, until a new word without walm following it appears.",0.8,45,walm
"To deduce what ""walm"" means, we must look for patterns related to its presence in the input and the corresponding output.

In all examples where ""walm"" appears, the output color immediately following the appearance of ""walm"" is always red, except when it's preceded by ""dax"" or ""lug,"" after which the color turns green and then blue, respectively.

From this, it seems that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color of the word that precedes it, but with specific rules when followed by ""dax"" or ""lug,” where it causes a change to the next color in a specific sequence (red to green or green to blue).

Furthermore, the presence of ""walm"" causes the continuation of the same color output that has been set by the rules above for the remaining words after ""walm"" in the input.

Putting this together, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be as follows:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in an input, the output color repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm."" If ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the color changes from red to green. If ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the color changes from green to blue. The repeated color continues for any subsequent words after ""walm"" unless influenced by another word that alters the color sequence.

So, ""walm"" -> meaning. Meaning: A rule that repeats the color associated with the previous word in the output or modifies it according to the specific preceding word (as seen with ""dax"" and ""lug""), and continues this color for subsequent words.",0.8,45,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce a pattern for what walm might mean when it comes to the output color pattern. In each instance where walm appears in the input, the output color that corresponds to walm is red.

However, we do not have a clear one-to-one correspondence because in the first example (Input: wif walm dax zup), walm results in 'red' but there are two other 'red' outputs corresponding to 'wif' and the second 'walm' before the pattern changes. Yet in the other examples, walm is consistently followed by a series of identical colors (red in the third example, green in the fourth, and blue in the fifth).

From this, it seems that walm causes the following word(s) (if any) to repeat the color pattern established immediately before walm. In the examples where a word precedes walm, the color it outputs is then used consecutively for all words following walm.

Let's review the evidence:
1. Input: wif walm dax zup; Output: red red red green yellow -> wif is red; walm then causes the next word, dax, to also be red.
2. Input: zup walm dax; Output: yellow yellow yellow green -> zup is yellow; walm causes the next word, dax, to be yellow as well.
3. Input: wif walm; Output: red red red -> wif is red; walm causes this color to repeat.
4. Input: zup dax walm; Output: yellow green green green -> dax is green; walm then makes all following colors green.
5. Input: dax lug walm; Output: green blue blue blue -> lug is blue; walm makes the sequence stay blue.

walm -> meaning. Rule: When proceeded by a word, walm makes all following words repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it. If there is no word preceding walm, it defaults to red.",0.8,45,walm
"Observing the examples provided, the following patterns emerge regarding the word ""walm"" and its corresponding output colors:

- In every instance where ""walm"" is used, the output color following it is ""red.""
- When other words come before ""walm,"" their output colors vary: ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" leads to ""green.""
- The color sequence does not appear to change with different sequences of words around ""walm""; for example, ""wif walm"" and ""wif walm dax zup"" both begin with ""red red red.""

Using these observations, we can deduce the following rule for ""walm"":

"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,46,dax
"Based on the examples given, 'dax' consistently translates to the color 'green.' When the word 'dax' appears in an input sentence, the word 'green' appears in the corresponding output sentence. Here's how 'dax' translates in each of the examples provided:

Input: dax wif zup
Output: green red yellow
Rule: dax -> green, wif -> red, zup -> yellow

Input: zup lug zup dax
Output: yellow blue yellow green

Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
Output: yellow blue red green green red
Rule: zup -> yellow, lug -> blue, wif -> red, dax -> green (note that 'bluf' is not clearly defined but seems to correspond to 'green,' possibly an input error since 'dax' already corresponds to 'green')

Input: wif dax
Output: red green
Rule: wif -> red, dax -> green

Input: dax
Output: green
Rule: dax -> green

Given the above, the rule for the nonce word 'dax' seems to be: 

dax -> green",1.0,46,dax
"Based on the given examples, it seems that each specific word is consistently translated to a particular color. We can identify the following patterns:

- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" has only appeared once, which corresponds to ""green"", but it is followed by ""wif"" which is ""red"". Since two ""greens"" cannot consecutively stand for ""bluf wif"", it is likely that ""bluf"" stands for another color that was not given a corresponding nonce word in the input. Due to lack of other examples for ""bluf"", we can't conclusively determine its meaning.

Given the consistent one-to-one relationship between each word and its color, it is reasonable to conclude that ""dax"" means ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,46,dax
"From the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"", regardless of its position in the sequence of nonce words.

Hence, the rule we can induce is:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,46,dax
"Analyzing the examples:

1. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

2. Input: wif dax zup dax
   Output: red green yellow green

3. Input: dax zup wif zup
   Output: green yellow red yellow

4. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

5. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue

Based on the above examples, whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the first color produced in the output is ""red"". Also, ""wif"" does not seem to have any additional impact on subsequent colors; those appear to be determined by the other words following it.

Taking each example:

1. After ""wif"" we have two reds, but this repetition could correspond to the word ""walm"" rather than because of ""wif"".
2. ""wif"" is followed by one instance of ""red"", and the next colors follow the pattern established by ""dax"" and ""zup"".
3. Similarly, ""wif"" is followed by a single ""red"", with the rest of the pattern not affected by ""wif"".
4. There are two ""reds"", but this is the first occurrence of ""bluf"", so it is not clear if ""wif"" induces the second ""red"" or ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".
5. Again, ""wif"" is followed by a single ""red"", with the next color (""blue"") seemingly determined by ""lug"".

So by induction, the rule appears to be that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" every time it appears. Whatever comes after ""wif"" seems to follow its own rule for color assignment, independent of the presence of ""wif"".

Thus, 
wif -> meaning. 
Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".",1.0,46,wif
"To determine the meaning of the word ""wif,"" let's examine the relationship between the input and the output in the provided examples. 

- In the first example, ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" translates to ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow."" The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" just like ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Yet, we need to discern whether ""red"" always follows ""wif,"" or whether it's context-dependent.
  
- In the second example, ""wif dax zup dax"" translates to ""red green yellow green,"" and again ""wif"" is linked to ""red.""

- In the third example, ""dax zup wif zup"" results in ""green yellow red yellow,"" adding further support that ""wif"" leads to ""red.""

- The fourth example, ""wif bluf,"" yielding ""red red"" does not provide enough context as ""bluf"" does not appear in other examples; however, ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red.""

- Finally, the fifth example, ""wif lug,"" outputs ""red blue."" Again, ""wif"" is linked to ""red.""

Given these observations, it seems that whatever follows ""wif"" in the examples, ""wif"" consistently maps to the output ""red."" There is no example that deviates from this pattern. Therefore, we can induce the rule:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,46,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the pattern of colors corresponding to the words before and after ""wif"" in the examples.

In the first example:
- ""dax wif"" leads to ""green red""
- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red""
- ""lug zup walm"" leads to ""red blue yellow yellow""

In the second example:
- ""wif dax"" leads to ""red green""
- ""dax zup dax"" leads to ""green yellow green""

In the third example:
- ""dax zup wif"" leads to ""green yellow red""
- ""wif zup"" leads to ""red yellow""

In the fourth example:
- ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red""

In the fifth example:
- ""wif lug"" leads to ""red blue""

Analyzing the colors, we notice that the word ""wif"" is consistently followed by the color ""red"" irrespective of the word that comes after it. Additionally, the color that follows ""red"" seems to be dependent on the word after ""wif"" rather than ""wif"" itself. This suggests that the meaning of ""wif"" is directly linked to the color ""red"" regardless of its position.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,46,wif
"From the examples provided, we can first identify that each unique input word is mapped to a unique output color. We see that 'dax', 'zup', 'lug', 'walm', and 'bluf' are consistently mapped to the same colors across different examples. 'dax' always maps to green, 'zup' to yellow, 'lug' to blue, 'walm' to yellow, and 'bluf' to red.

The word 'wif' also maps to a consistent color across all examples: red. Since the color it outputs does not vary with context, and there is no pattern of change as it always translates to the same color regardless of position or neighboring words, we can deduce that 'wif' represents the color red.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,46,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif"" based on the given examples, let's first list the input-output pairs for easy reference:

1. dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
2. wif dax zup dax -> red green yellow green
3. dax zup wif zup -> green yellow red yellow
4. wif bluf -> red red
5. wif lug -> red blue

Let's examine the patterns where ""wif"" appears:

- When ""wif"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""green red.""
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output is ""red green.""
- When ""wif"" appears before different words (""zup"", ""bluf"", ""lug""), the pattern always starts with ""red.""

From these observations, it seems that the output associated with ""wif"" is always ""red."" However, this output can be influenced by the words around it, especially ""dax"", which has an output of ""green"" both times when it appears either immediately before or immediately after ""wif.""

"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the word ""blue,"" but it duplicates the color adjective that precedes it (i.e., ""bluf"" repeats the previous color word or, in the absence of a previous color word, defaults to ""blue"").

Explanation: In each example, the use of ""bluf"" results in the appearance of two identical color words in the output.

- In ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" repeats this color, resulting in ""green green.""
- In ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" repeats this color, thus ""red red.""
- In instances where ""bluf"" is preceded by a non-color word (like ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue""), ""bluf"" acts as a color word and uses the color ""blue"" by default.

Therefore: bluf -> ""repeats the previous color word or defaults to 'blue'""",1.0,46,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the previous word.

Explanation:

- ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green,"" which implies that ""bluf"" means to repeat the color associated with ""dax"" (green).
- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red,"" following the same pattern; ""bluf"" is repeating the color associated with ""wif"" (red).
- In ""dax bluf wif lug,"" ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""dax"" (green), and then ""lug"" follows with its associated color (blue).
- For the input ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug,"" ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""lug"" (blue), and the colors continue with their respective associated words.
- Finally, ""lug wif lug bluf"" gives ""blue red blue blue,"" where ""bluf"" again repeats the color of the previous word (blue, associated with ""lug"").",1.0,46,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> the color associated with the word that comes just before it.

"Observing the given examples, I will find the pattern corresponding to the word ""walm"" and its associated output.

In the first example:

Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

Zup -> yellow
Walm -> yellow
Dax -> green
Wif -> red

In the second example:

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

Zup -> yellow
Walm -> yellow
Lug -> blue
Wif -> red
Dax -> green

In the third example:

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

Dax -> green
Lug -> blue
Walm -> blue
Zup -> yellow
Wif -> red

In the fourth example:

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red

Dax -> green
Walm -> green
Wif -> red
Bluf -> red

In the fifth example:

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Dax -> green
Walm -> green

From observing the input and output sequences, we can deduce that ""walm"" takes on the color output of the word immediately preceding it. If the word preceding ""walm"" is ""zup,"" then ""walm"" outputs ""yellow."" If the word before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" then ""walm"" outputs ""green,"" and so on.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: If the previous word outputs ""color,"" then ""walm"" outputs ""color.""",1.0,46,walm
"To determine what ""walm"" means, we have to analyze its occurrence in multiple sentences and look for patterns in the corresponding outputs. Let's analyze the outputs for every instance of ""walm"":

- In the first example (zup walm dax zup dax wif), ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"", which corresponds to the color green. However, when ""walm"" appears, the output is yellow, yellow, yellow, suggesting that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the last color in triplicate before moving on to the next color. In this case, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- In the second example (zup walm lug zup wif dax), ""walm"" appears after ""zup"" (yellow) and is followed by ""lug"", which corresponds to the color blue. Still, the output is yellow, yellow, yellow (repeating the last mentioned color three times before moving to blue).
- In the third example (dax lug walm zup wif), ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), and again the output is the previous color repeated three times (blue, blue, blue) before continuing with the next input.
- In the fourth example (dax walm wif bluf), ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), and once again, the output is the last color repeated three times (green, green, green) before continuing.
- The last example (dax walm) has ""walm"" following ""dax"" (green) with no other input after ""walm"". The output is green thrice, demonstrating a consistency of the rule that ""walm"" repeats the previous color three times.

Rule: walm -> meaning: When ""walm"" appears, it causes the last color mentioned to be repeated three times before moving on to the next color's corresponding output, if any.

Write your answer like this: walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context.

Rule: walm -> meaning: Repeat the last color mentioned three times.",1.0,46,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine each instance where it appears and the corresponding output:

1. zup walm dax zup dax wif -> yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
2. zup walm lug zup wif dax -> yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
3. dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue blue yellow red
4. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red
5. dax walm -> green green green

Observations:

- In every example, the word ""walm"" yields the output ""green"".
- The word ""walm"" seems to make the word that precedes it (if there is one) also produce the output ""green"".
- If there is no word before ""walm"", the output remains ""green"".
- ""walm"" makes the word that follows it (if there is one) produce the output ""green"".

Hence, ""walm"" likely functions as a modifier that changes the coding of both the word immediately before and after it (if any) to ""green.""

Rule: walm -> turns the output of adjacent words (preceding and following, if applicable) to green. If ""walm"" is at the beginning or end, or if there's no adjacent word, its own output is green.",1.0,46,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze how each ""input"" term relates to its ""output"" color:

- In inputs where ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" the color sequence is ""green green green"" followed by something else, suggesting ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color before it. 
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the sequence is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which again suggests ""walm"" repeats the previous color.
- For ""dax walm wif,"" we have ""green green green red,"" indicating ""walm"" has the same effect irrespective of what word follows.
- The lone ""dax walm"" has the output ""green green green,"" making it clear that ""walm"" repeats the prior color three times.

Considering the above patterns, ""walm"" appears to mean repetition of the color represented by the word before it, specifically repeated three times.

"From the given examples, it seems that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red,"" regardless of the context in which it is used (alone or in combination with other nonce words). Therefore, the deduced meaning of ""wif"" would be the color red.

- ""wif dax"" translates to ""red green,"" with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red.""
- ""wif"" by itself translates to ""red.""
- ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" translates to ""red red green green red red red blue red,"" with each occurrence of ""wif"" consistently corresponding to ""red.""

Therefore, the rule we can induce is:

"By observing the pattern of input and output, the word ""wif"" appears to translate directly as ""red."" Regardless of other words present, every occurrence of ""wif"" consistently results in the word ""red"" in the output.

Therefore, the deduction is:

"zup -> yellow

Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of what other words accompany it.

"Based on the examples provided, each time the word ""zup"" is used, the word ""yellow"" is included in the output. This suggests that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" The presence of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,47,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rules regarding the meanings of ""zup,"" ""dax,"" and ""wif"":

- ""zup wif"" combines ""yellow"" and ""red"" to produce ""yellow red""
- ""zup dax wif"" combines ""yellow,"" ""green,"" and ""red"" to produce ""yellow green red""

Therefore, the rule can be summarized as:

Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and it serves as a base color. Additional words such as ""dax"" and ""wif"" translate to ""green"" and ""red"" respectively, and are added to the ""zup"" color as modifiers when combined in a phrase.",1.0,47,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Each instance of the word zup consistently corresponds to the color yellow in the provided outputs, regardless of what other words accompany it.",1.0,47,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

The occurrences of the word ""zup"" in the examples consistently result in the output ""yellow,"" whether ""zup"" appears alone or with other words following it. This consistent association allows us to deduce that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. Other words following ""zup,"" such as ""dax"" and ""wif,"" correspond to additional colors added to the output, namely ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""red"" for ""wif.""",1.0,47,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following pattern:

- In the first example, ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" results in ""yellow red red yellow blue"". We can see that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue"". Given that ""wif"" translates to ""red"", we can deduce that ""bluf"" caused the output to repeat the previous color word.
- The second example, ""wif bluf"", yields ""red red"" which confirms the idea that ""bluf"" repeats the previous color word.
- In the third example, ""zup bluf wif"", the output is ""yellow yellow red,"" supporting the earlier deduction that ""bluf"" repeats the previous color word, since ""zup"" is ""yellow"".
- The fourth example, ""lug bluf"", translates to ""blue blue"" which further confirms that ""bluf"" repeats the previous color mentioned.
- The last example, ""lug bluf dax bluf"", has an output of ""blue blue green green"". Here we observe the introduction of a new word ""dax"" which translates to ""green"". ""Bluf"" is seen to still be repeating the previous color word, ""blue"" in the first instance and ""green"" in the second.

With this consistent pattern across all examples, the rule for ""bluf"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color word that comes immediately before it.",1.0,47,bluf
"Based on the provided input-output pairs, we can deduce the following pattern:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

It appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word preceding it. When ""bluf"" is present after another word, it results in the output of that word's associated color repeated. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is that it repeats the color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.",1.0,47,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, each instance of the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the output ""red"", ""yellow"" or ""blue"", but not in a consistent color each time. The rule appears to involve not just the word ""bluf"" itself, but also the context in which it is used, that is, the words around it. 

Let's look at the examples one by one:

- In the first example, ""zup wif bluf zup lug"", ""bluf"" leads to ""red"" and is surrounded by ""wif"". 
- In the second example, ""wif bluf"", we see ""bluf"" again leads to ""red"" and it follows ""wif"".
- In the third example, ""zup bluf wif"", ""bluf"" leads to ""yellow"" and it follows ""zup"".
- In the fourth example, ""lug bluf"", ""bluf"" leads to ""blue"" and follows ""lug"".
- In the fifth example, ""lug bluf dax bluf"", ""bluf"" leads to ""blue"" when following ""lug"" but ""green"" when followed by ""dax"" which breaks previous consistency.

From this analysis, we deduce the following pattern:

""bluf"" takes the color based on the word just before it:
- When preceded by ""zup"", the color is ""yellow"".
- When preceded by ""wif"", the color is ""red"".
- When preceded by ""lug"", the color is ""blue"".

The exception is when it follows the word ""dax,"" which isn't part of the prompt, but looking at the pattern, we could theorize that ""dax"" might change the color to ""green"".

Thus, I propose the rule:
Rule: ""bluf"" represents a color, and the specific color represented is determined by the word directly preceding it in the sequence. For ""zup"" it is ""yellow"", for ""wif"" it is ""red"", and for ""lug"" it is ""blue"". Since ""dax"" doesn't appear before ""bluf"" except in a broken pattern, we cannot confirm its specific influence on ""bluf"" within the given examples.

bluf -> meaning:
""bluf"" is a word that represents a color based on the word that precedes it.",0.8,47,bluf
"bluf -> color red

Rule: Each instance of the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red, regardless of its position or surrounding words. The other words in the context (""zup"", ""wif"", ""lug"", ""dax"") correspond to different colors (""yellow"", ""red"", ""blue"", ""green"" respectively). The output color is directly associated with each input word without regard to sequence or repetition.",0.0,47,bluf
"bluf -> blue. 

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the given context.",0.0,47,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at each example and identify patterns to figure out the rule.

1. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is green repeated three times.
2. When ""walm"" stands alone after ""dax,"" the output is still green repeated three times.
3. When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""lug"" comes before ""zup,"" the output is one yellow followed by blue repeated three times, indicating ""lug"" may trigger blue and ""zup"" may trigger ""walm"" to be yellow.
4. When ""wif"" precedes ""zup lug dax zup walm,"" ""wif"" has an output of red, and the sequence follows the pattern where ""zup"" yields yellow and ""lug"" follows with blue, ""dax"" yields green and ""zup"" again yields yellow, except the final ""walm"" causes the sequence to repeat yellow three times.
5. In the final example, ""wif"" yields red, ""walm"" repeats this, ""dax"" then yields green, ""zup"" yields yellow, and ""wif"" red. When ""lug"" appears, it yields blue, which is then repeated twice following the ""walm.""

From these patterns, we can observe that ""walm"" doesn't have a consistent color output by itself, but rather, it seems to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it three times. Therefore, ""walm"" functions as a repeater of the previous color three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color assigned to the word immediately preceding it three times.",1.0,47,walm
"Based on the examples given, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" is associated with a specific pattern of colors that follows each instance of ""walm"" in the input. Reviewing the given examples, one can infer the following:

- In all instances where ""walm"" follows another word, several colors appear after ""walm"" in the output. The number of colors corresponds to the position of ""walm"" in the input (counting from the beginning), with ""green"" representing the first position, ""red"" the second, ""yellow"" the third, and so on.

Let's verify this with the given examples:

1. dax walm wif walm zup
    - First ""walm"" is the second word: red red red (since ""dax"" is the first word and ""walm"" is the second, ""red"" appears three times)
    - Second ""walm"" is the fourth word: yellow yellow yellow

2. dax walm
    - ""walm"" is the second word: red red red

3. zup lug walm
    - ""walm"" is the third word: yellow yellow yellow yellow

4. wif zup lug dax zup walm
    - ""walm"" is the sixth word: yellow yellow yellow

5. wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
    - First ""walm"" is the second word: red red red
    - Second ""walm"" is the seventh word: blue blue blue

From the pattern in the examples, the rule for ""walm"" could be formulated as follows:

Rule:
walm -> For each occurrence of ""walm"" in the input, it is replaced by a series of colors in the output. The specific color used corresponds to the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence (counting from the start), with each color repeating as many times as the position number of ""walm"". The sequence of colors corresponding to positions is inferred as: 1st - ""green"", 2nd - ""red"", 3rd - ""yellow"", 4th - ""blue"", and so forth as needed.",1.0,47,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should analyze the patterns in the input and corresponding output. 

1. In the first example, there's a pattern that when ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" we get three greens, and when it follows ""wif,"" there's a red. When it follows ""zup,"" yellow is the output.
2. When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" alone, we still get three greens.
3. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup lug,"" we get four blues.
4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and produces two extra yellow outputs in addition to the previous pattern.
5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" following ""wif"" produces two more reds, and when it follows ""lug,"" it results in two additional blues.

From these occurrences, it can be determined that ""walm"" induces a repetition of the previous color based on the word it follows. Specifically:
- If ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the color green is repeated three times.
- If it follows ""wif,"" the color red is repeated three times.
- If it comes after ""zup lug,"" the color is blue and is repeated four times.

Noticing that the number of repetitions seems to correspond with the number of letters in the preceding word, we can derive the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word as many times as there are letters in the preceding word.

Examples:
- ""dax walm"" -> green repeated 3 times (since ""dax"" has 3 letters)
- ""wif walm"" -> red repeated 3 times (since ""wif"" has 3 letters)
- ""zup lug walm"" -> blue repeated 4 times (since ""lug"" has 3 letters plus ""zup"")

Given ""lug"" appears in the input, and ""blue"" is not directly output in association with it, but rather follows a pattern of doubling the output, it's plausible that the rule for ""lug"" specifically involves doubling the output color of the next color in sequence, not its intrinsic color. 

Therefore, the specific rule for ""lug"" seems to be related to the doubling effect rather than a direct color association. 

Hence, the final rule for ""walm"" considering the ""lug"" factor would be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word, doubling the quantity if the word is ""lug,"" as many times as there are letters in the preceding word (excluding ""lug""). 

The ""lug"" word appears to modify the number of color repetitions caused by ""walm"" rather than the color itself.",0.9,47,walm
"Analyzing the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to affect not just a single word but a sequence of words following it. Here is the breakdown:

- ""dax walm"" results in three greens, suggesting ""walm"" after ""dax"" generates two more ""green"".
- ""zup lug walm"" results in ""yellow"" followed by three ""blue"", suggesting ""walm"" after ""lug"" generates two more ""blue"".
- ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" gives us a sequence where ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the result is three more ""yellow"" than we'd expect from ""zup"" by itself.
- ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" shows that ""walm"" after ""wif"" adds two more ""red"" and ""walm"" after ""lug"" adds two more ""blue"".

Combining these observations, it seems that ""walm"" has the rule of repeating the color associated with the word that precedes it two more times. In other words:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated two additional times. 

The pattern is as follows:
- ""dax"" is associated with ""green"", so ""dax walm"" means ""green green green"".
- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"", so ""zup walm"" means ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- ""wif"" is associated with ""red"", so ""wif walm"" means ""red red red"".
- ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"", so ""lug walm"" means ""blue blue blue"".

Therefore, the rule can be defined as:

walm -> the color of the word before ""walm"" is repeated three times in total.",0.9,47,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" means three repetitions of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

For example:
- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"", indicating that ""walm"" implies three repetitions of ""green,"" which is associated with ""dax"".
- ""zup lug walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue,"" showing that ""walm"" causes ""lug"", which corresponds to ""blue,"" to be repeated three times.
- In sequences where ""walm"" follows another word, that word's color repeats three times, as seen in ""wif walm"", which becomes ""red red red"".

- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""

4. ""zup dax bluf"" -> ""yellow green green""
5. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""

In examples 1, 2, and 5, after ""bluf"" is mentioned, the output has a repeated color. In examples 3 and 4 which involve three words, ""bluf"" results in the color of the word directly preceding it being repeated in the output.

- In example 1, ""lug"" follows ""bluf"" and the output for ""lug"" is ""blue."" However, the second ""red"" for ""wif"" is what's directly after ""bluf.""
- In example 2, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and the color ""green"" does not repeat. Instead, ""wif"" follows ""bluf"" resulting in the color ""red"" appearing twice, just like ""wif bluf"" in example 5.
- In example 3, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and its color ""yellow"" is repeated after ""bluf.""
- In example 4, just like in example 3, the color of the word before ""bluf"" (this time ""dax"" with the color ""green"") is repeated after ""bluf.""

Based on this pattern, we can infer that the word ""bluf"" causes the output of the following word to be an exact repetition of the last color mentioned before ""bluf"".

Rule: **bluf -> causes the next color output to be a repeat of the last color mentioned before ""bluf"".**",0.8,48,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates into a color. As it corresponds to the color output immediately following 'bluf' in each example, it would appear that ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""red"" when it is preceded by ""wif,"" and translates to ""yellow"" when it is preceded by ""zup."" However, when ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" it then translates to ""blue.""

Reviewing the inputs and outputs:

1. wif bluf lug zup => red red blue yellow
2. dax wif bluf => green red red
3. zup bluf lug => yellow yellow blue
4. zup dax bluf => yellow green green
5. wif bluf => red red

From the second and fifth examples, we see that whenever ""wif"" appears before ""bluf,"" the output is ""red."" This suggests ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red."" On the other hand, in the third and fourth examples, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and the color ""yellow"" appears in the output. It is not entirely clear what ""bluf"" translates to on its own, as it mirrors the color of the word preceding it.

Given these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" doesn't have a fixed meaning but instead takes the color of the word that precedes it unless that preceding color is then followed by the word ""lug,"" where ""bluf"" then translates to ""blue.""

Here is the formulated rule:
Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word unless followed by ""lug,"" in which case it translates to ""blue.""",0.8,48,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word 'bluf' corresponds to the color 'red' every time it appears. However, where 'bluf' appears twice in sequence (as in ""wif bluf bluf""), the sequence translates to ""red red"". Part of the rule seems to be that when a color is to be repeated, bluf takes the place of the second iteration. 

To clarify with the provided data:

- In ""wif bluf lug zup"", 'bluf' corresponds to 'red' following another 'red', resulting in 'red red blue yellow'.
- In ""dax wif bluf"", 'bluf' also translates to 'red' after 'wif' which is 'red', giving 'green red red'.
- In ""zup bluf lug"", there is no repetition, so 'bluf' just means 'blue' here, resulting in 'yellow yellow blue'.
- In ""zup dax bluf"", there is again no repetition, so 'bluf' translates to 'green', giving 'yellow green green'.
- In ""wif bluf"", 'bluf' follows 'wif', which means 'red', and 'bluf' translates to 'red' after 'wif', giving 'red red'.

So, the rule could be:

Rule: 'bluf' -> when following a color word, it repeats that color. If not following a color word, it translates to the color that would logically follow in the sequence (which, based on the limited examples, seems to substitute 'green' or 'blue'). However, we cannot definitively conclude the color it represents without further examples when not following a color word, so we may only specify that 'bluf' repeats the preceding color:
 
bluf -> meaning: Repetition of the preceding color word.",0.4,48,bluf
"bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" in the input correlates to the word ""red"" in the output.",0.0,48,bluf
"Exploring the provided inputs and outputs, we can surmise a few patterns that could lead to understanding the rule(s) underlying the nonce word ""walm"".

1. The word ""walm"" always corresponds to a sequence of the same color in the output, and this color always matches the color directly preceding ""walm"".
   
   For example, in ""dax wif walm"", ""wif"" translates to ""red"", followed by ""walm"", which results in ""red red red"".

2. The number of times the color repeats in the output corresponds to the number of words from the start to the word ""walm"" itself, excluding ""walm"".

   For example, in ""zup dax lug walm zup"", there are three words before ""walm"", thus ""blue"" (the color corresponding to ""lug"", the word right before ""walm"") is repeated three times.

3. The word ""walm"" does not seem to correspond to a specific color but rather takes on the property of repetition from whatever word (color) comes just before it.

With this understanding, we derive the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" means to repeat the color that immediately precedes it in the sequence the number of times equal to the count of words from the start of the sequence to the word ""walm"", excluding ""walm"" itself.

Therefore, walm -> repeat the preceding color as many times as there are words before ""walm"" in the sequence, not including ""walm"".",1.0,48,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce that the nonce word ""walm"" changes the output into multiple instances of the color that directly precedes it. 

Here is the breakdown of the rule induction based on each input/output pair:

1. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   - ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and the color red is repeated three times.

2. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   - ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the color blue is repeated three times.

3. Input: wif dax zup walm

   - ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the color yellow is repeated three times.

4. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" again and the color blue is repeated three times.

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" indicates repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here is the analysis:

1. ""dax wif walm"" translates to ""green red red red,"" which means ""walm"" causes ""red,"" the color associated with ""wif,"" to repeat three times.
2. ""zup dax lug walm zup"" translates to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow,"" so ""walm"" causes ""blue,"" the color associated with ""lug,"" to repeat three times.
3. ""wif dax zup walm"" translates to ""red green yellow yellow yellow,"" thus ""walm"" causes ""yellow,"" the color associated with ""zup,"" to repeat three times.
4. ""wif dax lug walm"" translates to ""red green blue blue blue,"" which means ""walm"" causes ""blue,"" the color associated with ""lug,"" to repeat three times.
5. ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" implying that ""walm"" causes ""yellow,"" the color associated with ""zup,"" to repeat three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the word immediately before it to repeat three times.",1.0,48,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" has a replicated effect on the color following it. Specifically, it seems to cause the color that comes after it to be repeated a number of times. Here is how each example supports this:

Input: dax wif walm -> Output: green red red red
- The color red, which follows ""wif"" (the word preceding ""walm""), is repeated three times.

Input: zup dax lug walm zup -> Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
- The color blue, which follows ""lug"" (the word preceding ""walm""), is repeated three times.

Input: wif dax zup walm -> Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
- The color yellow, which follows ""zup"" (the word preceding ""walm""), is repeated three times.

Input: wif dax lug walm -> Output: red green blue blue blue
- The color blue, which follows ""lug"" (the word preceding ""walm""), is repeated three times.

Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
- The color yellow, which would follow ""zup"" (the word preceding ""walm""), is repeated three times.

From these examples, we can conclude that ""walm"" causes the next color word in the sequence to be repeated exactly three times.

"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" has a correlation to the color ""green."" Every time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output. The number of times ""dax"" appears is equal to the number of ""green"" that appear consecutively in the output. 

Rule:

When observing the outputs, we can deduce that every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Therefore, ""dax"" translates to ""green.""",1.0,49,dax
"To decode the meaning of ""dax,"" we'll review the provided examples to see when ""dax"" is used and what output it correlates with.

Here's a breakdown of when ""dax"" appears and what follows it in the output:

1. When ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output is green followed by blue.
   - ""dax lug wif"" -> ""green blue red""
   - ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""

2. When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" the sequence green green green appears in the output.
   - ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" -> ""green green green red blue green green green""
   - ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green green green red""

3. When ""dax"" is followed by ""wif,"" the output starts with green red.
   - ""dax wif walm lug zup"" -> ""green red red red blue yellow""

From this information, we can deduce that ""dax"" precedes a sequence starting with green. Its meaning seems to change depending on the word that follows it. Here's the rule we can infer:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the output sequence, with additional rules for subsequent words that might alter the continuing sequence of colors.

Thus: 
dax -> green (followed by color sequences influenced by subsequent words)",0.9,49,dax
"From the given examples, we can see that the output is a sequence of color names. Each instance of the nonce word ""wif"" in the input seems to correspond with the color ""red"" in the output. Therefore, we can induce that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,49,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" denotes a repeating pattern or sequence that affects the output. More specifically, ""wif"" seems to initiate a repeating color pattern starting with red. To determine the correct mapping, let's analyze each example:

1. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue
   
Here ""wif"" directly translates to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

2. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   
Here ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and following it, the colors seem to be repeating in a pattern: ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" repeats the ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""walm"" seems to introduce a new color ""blue,"" ""dax"" changes the pattern with ""green,"" and the last ""lug"" goes back to ""blue.""

However, let's keep in mind that coincidences in one or two instances may not constitute a reliable pattern. Let’s keep examining the inputs and outputs:

3. Input: zup dax wif zup
   Output: yellow green red yellow
   
Here, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red"" and the subsequent ""zup"" repeats the ""yellow.""

4. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   
Here the ""wif"" results in three ""red"" colors in a row, followed by a ""yellow,"" then ""blue,"" another ""yellow,"" and another repetition of ""yellow"" for ""zup walm.""

5. Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
   Output: yellow red red yellow blue
   
Here ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" initiates two ""red,"" followed by another ""yellow"" for ""zup,"" then ""blue"" for ""lug.""

After looking at these examples, we can see that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" but it doesn't seem to account for the repetitions alone, and the overall pattern is not clear yet. However, the constant is that every instance of ""wif"" in the input results in ""red"" in the output.

So, we don't have enough consistent evidence to suggest a rule more complex than the direct translation of ""wif"" to ""red,"" without further examples that might show a pattern where ""wif"" affects the adjacent words or subsequences. So, the rule that can be deduced from the given examples is:

Rule: wif means red",1.0,49,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the word ""red"". Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Therefore, we can establish the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,49,wif
"Rule: wif -> red

Each instance of the word ""wif"" is translated to ""red"" in the outputs provided.",1.0,49,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif"", let's look at each line's input and output and try to correlate them:

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue
- The word ""wif"" is followed by a single word ""lug"" and translates to ""red"", while ""lug"" is ""blue"".

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
- Here, ""wif"" is followed by a sequence of different words. ""wif"" is again ""red"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""bluf"" is ""yellow"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""walm"" is ""blue"", ""dax"" is ""green"", and the next ""lug"" is still ""blue"".

Input: zup dax wif zup
Output: yellow green red yellow
- ""zup"" and ""dax"" are consistent with previous translations; after ""wif"", ""zup"" again appears and is still ""yellow"". ""wif"" here is isolated between these words and translates to ""red"" again.

Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
- ""wif"" appears three times in a row at the beginning and each instance is ""red"". Following that, ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", and ""walm"" is ""yellow"".

Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
Output: yellow red red yellow blue
- ""zup"" at the start is ""yellow"", ""wif"" is ""red"" and is followed by ""bluf"", which is also ""red"" this time (different from the second example), followed by ""zup"" as ""yellow"" and ""lug"" as ""blue"".

From the examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" itself translates to ""red"" consistently, regardless of what follows or precedes it. It is independent of context and does not seem to depend on the position in the sequence or the words around it.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,49,wif
Rule: zup -> yellow.,1.0,49,zup
"zup -> yellow

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in all the examples provided.",1.0,49,zup
zup -> yellow,1.0,49,zup
"Based on the examples, ""zup"" seems to consistently correspond to the output ""yellow"". Therefore, the rule appears to be quite straightforward:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates directly to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,49,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's first look at the color outputs and their corresponding input words:

- When ""dax"" is the input, the output is ""green.""
- When ""lug"" is the input, the output is ""blue.""
- When ""zup"" is the input, the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""wif"" is the input, the output is ""red.""

Now, let's analyze the outputs when ""bluf"" is included:

- ""dax bluf"" yields ""green green,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, which is ""green"" in this case.
- ""lug bluf zup"" yields ""blue blue yellow,"" reinforcing the idea that ""bluf"" might repeat the color associated with the word right before it, which is ""blue.""
- ""wif zup bluf"" yields ""red yellow yellow,"" again pointing to ""bluf"" repeating the color of the word right before it, which is ""yellow"" (associated with ""zup"").
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" becomes a bit more complex; based on the previous hypothesis, ""bluf"" should repeat the color ""yellow,"" and the output confirms this. The rest of the sequence does not seem to affect ""bluf.""
- ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" yields ""green yellow blue yellow yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and its output is ""yellow yellow,"" supporting the previous observations that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it.

Considering these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated in the output.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the word that precedes ""bluf.""",1.0,49,bluf
"The examples provided suggest that ""bluf"" has an output that changes depending on the word that precedes it. Let's break it down:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green.""
- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue.""
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- Notably, when ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" and is followed by more words, it still outputs ""yellow yellow,"" as seen in ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug,"" outputting ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue.""

Therefore, it seems that ""bluf"" doubles the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> doubles the color of the preceding word.",1.0,49,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to look at the context where it appears and the corresponding outputs.

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green

Input: lug bluf zup
Output: blue blue yellow

Input: wif zup bluf
Output: red yellow yellow

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow

From the above examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it. If we look at every instance of ""bluf,"" it is followed by a repetition of the color that precedes it in the sequence. 

For instance:

- ""dax bluf"" becomes ""green green""
- ""lug bluf"" in the context of ""lug bluf zup"" becomes ""blue blue,""

Also, it's important to note that ""bluf"" always appears after another word and never at the beginning. 

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it causes the output to repeat the color of the preceding word. 

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the preceding word",1.0,49,bluf
"From the given examples, we can deduce that ""bluf"" results in the word ""yellow"" in the output, and it seems to be dependent on the word that comes before ""bluf"" in the input sequence. Here's what the data tells us:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.
  
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue,"" again repeating the color associated with ""lug.""
  
- Next, when ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""

- Then, in a longer sequence with ""bluf"" after ""zup"" and followed by more words, ""bluf"" still translates to ""yellow"" after ""zup,"" consistent with the previous instances.

- Finally, when ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" even if there is a repetition of ""zup,"" it still translates to ""yellow.""

Based on this analysis, the rule for ""bluf"" can be deduced as:

Rule: ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with the word immediately preceding it in the input sequence. If no such association is provided or clear in the context, it defaults to ""yellow.""

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning: When preceded by a word with an associated color, ""bluf"" results in the duplication of the color associated with that word. If no color association is established, it defaults to the color ""yellow.""",0.8,49,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, bluf appears to correlate with the output ""yellow."" Each time the word bluf is included in the input, the corresponding output includes ""yellow."" Therefore, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""yellow."" 

Rule: bluf -> yellow",0.0,49,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that each unique word (excluding ""walm"") corresponds to a color:

- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red.

Now, let's analyze the occurrences of ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), and the output is three additional instances of blue.
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), and the output is two additional instances of red.
- In the third example, two occurrences of ""walm"", both following ""dax"" (green) and ""wif"" (red) respectively, lead to two additional instances of their color.
- The fourth example is the same as the first one, with ""walm"" following ""lug"" resulting in three additional instances of blue.
- The fifth example is a repetition of the first example.

From these observations, we can induce the following rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,49,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Evidence for the rule:

2. In ""wif walm dax"", ""wif"" corresponds to red, and after ""walm"", we see ""red"" repeated three times.
3. In ""dax walm wif walm"", ""dax"" corresponds to green, so after the first ""walm"" we get ""green"" repeated three times. Then ""wif"" corresponds to red and after the second ""walm"" we get ""red"" repeated three times.
4. In ""lug walm"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue and after ""walm"", we see ""blue"" repeated three times.
5. In ""dax lug walm"", the pattern is the same as the first example. ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and results in ""blue"" being repeated three times.

"Based on the given examples, we can induce the following correspondences between the nonce words and colors:

- ""zup"" seems to always correspond to the color ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" seems to consistently correspond to the color ""blue"".
- ""bluf"" appears to always correspond to the color ""red"".
- ""walm"" hasn't been directly defined but given the repeated pattern, it likely corresponds to ""blue"" (""walm"" appears once in the fourth input and results in an extra ""blue"" in the output).
- ""dax"" from the fifth input seems to correspond to ""green"".

Considering the pattern of the nonce word ""wif"", we see that it always corresponds to the color ""red"", regardless of its position in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

wif -> red",1.0,50,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. By examining the patterns, we can deduce the following associations:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> red
- dax -> green
- walm -> blue blue

Given this information, we can infer the meaning of ""wif"" in the context of these examples:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the provided examples.",1.0,50,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze it in the context of each provided example and the corresponding outputs.

1. Input: zup lug bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue blue red
   
In this example, ""wif"" is the last word of the input and corresponds to the last color ""red"" in the output.

2. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow
   
Here, ""wif"" comes first and corresponds to the first color ""red.""

3. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   
Again, ""wif"" comes first and corresponds to ""red,"" with ""bluf"" also corresponding to ""red.""

4. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   
In this example, ""wif"" again is the first word and corresponds to the first color ""red.""

5. Input: dax zup lug wif lug
   Output: green yellow blue red blue
   
Here, ""wif"" is the fourth word and corresponds to the fourth color ""red.""

Based on all the examples, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,50,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,50,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" In every example, when the word ""wif"" is present in the input, the word ""red"" is present at the corresponding position in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red",1.0,50,wif
"zup -> meaning. 

Rule: The word ""zup"" generates a sequence of colors that correspond to a previously mentioned set of words, each with its own color representation. When ""zup"" is mentioned, the colors for all the preceding words in the sequence are listed in the reverse order they were introduced. If a word is repeated, its color is also repeated in the output sequence for each occurrence.

- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""walm"" does not have a unique color, but seems to replicate the color of the word it follows.
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- ""bluf"" corresponds to yellow, which is the same color that ""zup"" represents. 

Thus, ""zup"" triggers a repetition of the colors already mentioned, in the reverse order, including the duplication effect of ""walm"".",1.0,50,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" can be deduced as follows:

- When ""zup"" follows a color-associated word, the word for the actual color corresponding to that association is produced, followed by ""yellow"".

- When ""zup"" precedes a color-associated word, ""yellow"" is produced followed by the word for the color corresponding to the associated word.

- When ""zup"" is sandwiched between two color-associated words, ""yellow"" is produced between their corresponding color words.

- When ""zup"" occurs multiple times, the pattern of colors corresponding to the adjacent words and ""yellow"" is repeated for each occurrence.

So, in essence, ""zup"" acts as a modifier that generates a ""yellow"" before or after color-associated words based on its placement in a sequence. If we had to define ""zup"" in one phrase, it would be as follows:

Rule: zup -> Insert ""yellow"" before or after an adjacent color-associated word, or repeat the pattern of the color and ""yellow"" if multiple color words are adjacent or if ""zup"" is repeated.",1.0,50,zup
"Based on the given examples, ""zup"" seems to indicate a repetition of the colors that the words correspond to, in the reverse order of their appearance before ""zup"". Each color is said the number of times the word appears before ""zup"". Here is the induction based on each example provided:

1. lug zup -> blue yellow: ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""zup"" causes the repetition of ""blue"" in reverse order (""blue"" before ""zup""), but since ""lug"" only appears once, ""blue"" is said only once followed by ""yellow"".

2. dax lug zup -> green blue yellow: ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""lug"" to blue. ""zup"" reverses the order and repeats each color once, leading to ""green blue"" becoming ""blue yellow"", with the addition of ""green"" because ""dax"" was mentioned before ""lug"".

3. zup dax lug -> yellow green blue: Since ""dax"" and ""lug"" appear before ""zup"", their corresponding colors ""green"" and ""blue"" are repeated in reverse order, making it ""yellow green blue"".

4. lug walm zup walm -> blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow: Here, ""lug"" appears once and ""walm"" appears twice before ""zup"", so ""zup"" repeats ""blue"" once and ""yellow"" twice in reverse order. Since the word ""walm"" appears again after ""zup"", its corresponding color ""yellow"" is repeated for each occurrence after ""zup"" as well.

5. wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue: ""wif"" corresponds to red and appears once before ""zup"", so ""zup"" causes ""red"" to repeat as ""yellow"" in reverse order. The words ""bluf"", ""lug"", and ""walm"" that appear after ""zup"" are translated directly to their corresponding colors, with each word representing its color once.

Rule:
zup -> For each word before ""zup"", repeat its corresponding color in reverse order of their appearance, once for each time the word appears before ""zup"". For each word after ""zup"", its corresponding color is repeated once for each occurrence.",0.8,50,zup
"zup -> meaning. Rule:

Based on the given examples, ""zup"" seems to act as a rule that converts the previously mentioned color-related words into a sequence of color outputs, following a specific order, before and after ""zup"". Each color-word translates into a color, with repetitions based on the occurrence of ""walm"", which itself means repetition of the previous color (blue). The colors are inverted in order when ""zup"" precedes them.

The rules for the colors seem to be:

- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- walm -> repeat the last color mentioned

So, we can infer the following:

1. ""lug zup"" turns ""lug"" into ""blue"" and then ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" which comes after blue.
2. ""dax lug zup"" translates to ""green blue yellow,"" following the same logic of each color translating to its respective output and then ""zup"" adding ""yellow"" at the end.
3. ""zup dax lug"" places ""zup"" at the beginning which inverts the order, so it becomes ""yellow green blue"".
4. ""lug walm zup walm"" repeats blue for ""lug"" and ""walm"", then adds ""yellow"" for ""zup"" and repeats ""yellow"" for the second ""walm"".
5. ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" shows that ""zup"" not only adds ""yellow"" but makes the sequence of colors that come after it a repeated ""yellow"" for each, so it seems to act as a multiply factor for the next colors in sequence, making ""wif"" red, ""zup"" makes the next sequence only consist of yellow, and ""lug walm"" repeat blue, with each color being repeated for the next occurrence.

From these examples, one could infer:

zup -> meaning. Rule: After ""zup"", all following colors turn to yellow until a new color word is mentioned. If ""zup"" is at the beginning or inbetween color words, it seems to affect the order, placing yellow at the beginning for the first instance and potentially acting as a reversal for the sequence that comes before it. If ""zup"" is at the end or there are no new color words following it, it simply adds a ""yellow"" at the end of the sequence. If followed by ""walm,"" ""zup"" causes a repetition of ""yellow"" multiple times.",0.8,50,zup
"Based on the examples given, the nonce word ""zup"" seems to represent a rule rather than a direct translation to a single color. Here's the analysis:

1. When ""lug"" is presented before ""zup,"" it's translated as ""blue yellow,"" with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"" and zup adding ""yellow.""

2. The addition of ""dax"" before ""lug zup"" results in ""green"" being added before the ""blue yellow"" pattern, indicating that ""dax"" means ""green,"" but ""lug zup"" continues to result in ""blue yellow.""

3. Reversing the order to ""zup dax lug"" rearranges the colors to ""yellow green blue,"" implying that ""zup"" affects the order of the colors, bringing the color associated with ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" to the forefront.

4. For the input ""lug walm zup walm,"" we get ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, the repetition of ""walm"" after ""zup"" seems to cause a repetition of the colors ""blue"" and ""yellow,"" derived from ""lug"" and ""zup"" respectively.

5. The input ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" results in ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue."" This pattern suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" has no direct translation but might affect the repetition since it does not correspond directly to a color, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""zup"" inserts ""yellow"" and causes repetition, and ""walm"" seems to augment the repetition as well.

Considering the patterns observed, the rule for ""zup"" appears to be that it translates to ""yellow"" and also introduces repetition of the next color(s). When encountered, ""zup"" inserts ""yellow"" into the output sequence and replicates the color(s) that come immediately after ""zup"" the same number of times ""zup"" has been used in the sequence.

Rule: zup -> Yellow and causes repetition of the subsequent color(s).",0.8,50,zup
"Based on the given examples, it seems that each unique word corresponds to a unique color in the output. Let's break down the examples.

- Input: wif bluf lug zup -> Output: red red blue yellow
- Input: zup walm lug wif bluf -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
- Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
- Input: dax zup wif bluf lug -> Output: green yellow red red blue
- Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red

From these examples, when the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output an equal number of times. Therefore, ""bluf"" is consistently translated to ""red"". Additionally, ""wif"" also translates to ""red"", ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", and ""dax"" translates to ""green"".

Based on this pattern:

Rule: bluf -> red",1.0,50,bluf
bluf -> red,1.0,50,bluf
Rule: bluf -> red,0.6,50,bluf
"bluf -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue.",0.0,50,bluf
Rule: bluf -> red blue,0.0,50,bluf
"Rule: walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the word before it three times.

Based on the given examples, when the word ""walm"" appears after another word, the output is the color that corresponds to that word repeated three times. The color replications suggest that ""walm"" is an instruction to repeat the previously mentioned color. Here is how the rule applies to the examples provided:

Example 1: ""zup walm wif""
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, followed by ""walm"", hence ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- Then ""wif"" corresponds to red.

Example 2: ""zup walm dax""
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, followed by ""walm"", hence ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- Then ""dax"" corresponds to green.

Example 3: ""dax walm wif walm""
- ""dax"" corresponds to green, followed by ""walm"", hence ""green"" is repeated three times.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red, followed by ""walm"", hence ""red"" is repeated three times.

Example 4: ""wif walm dax zup""
- ""wif"" corresponds to red, followed by ""walm"", hence ""red"" is repeated three times.
- ""dax"" corresponds to green, followed by ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow.

Example 5: ""zup wif walm lug""
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" corresponds to red, followed by ""walm"" and thus ""red"" is repeated three times.
- ""lug"" is a new word that corresponds to blue (not seen in previous examples but can be deduced by the context).

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is to take the color associated with the previous word and repeat that color three times in the output.",1.0,50,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" serves as a repetition indicator for the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Each instance of ""walm"" causes the preceding color word to repeat three times in the output. Here are the associations made based on the examples:

- In the first example, ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" indicates that yellow should be repeated thrice.
- The second example further supports this, with ""dax walm"" translating to ""green green green.""
- Similarly, the third example shows ""dax walm wif walm"" leading to ""green green green red red red"" with both ""dax"" and ""wif"" being repeated thrice each time they are followed by ""walm.""
- The fourth example shows that when ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" three reds are outputted before moving on to the next color, ""dax,"" which is green, followed by ""zup,"" which is yellow.
- The fifth example reinforces this rule, where ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"" and the sequence ends with a single instance of ""lug"" which is translated to blue.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color-indicating word, repeat the corresponding color three times in the output.",1.0,50,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" acts as a repetition operator for the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. To illustrate, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""walm"" repeats the color given by ""zup,"" which is ""yellow."" Similarly, for ""wif walm,"" we get ""red red red,"" showing that ""walm"" repeats the color signified by ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

Let's break down each input and output to better understand the rule:

1. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red 
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and ""yellow"" is repeated three times, followed by the color for ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

2. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   Again, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" resulting in ""yellow"" repeated three times, followed by the color for ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

3. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   In this example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" resulting in ""green"" repeated three times, followed by ""wif,"" yielding ""red,"" and then ""walm"" again, which repeats ""red"" three times.

4. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   ""Walm"" follows ""wif"" here, hence ""red"" is repeated three times, then followed by the colors for ""dax"" and ""zup,"" which are ""green"" and ""yellow,"" respectively.

5. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   ""Walm"" follows ""wif,"" and so ""red"" is repeated three times after the initial ""yellow"" for ""zup,"" and then followed by ""blue"" for ""lug.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be the replication of the color indicated by the word that comes immediately before it, thrice. 

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color given by the preceding word three times.",1.0,50,walm
"Rule: ""walm"" -> increase the count by three of the color associated with the next word.

Explanation:
- When ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" the output is ""red"" three times.
- When ""dax"" follows ""walm,"" the output is ""green"" three times.
- When ""zup"" follows ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow"" three times.
- When ""lug"" follows ""walm,"" the output is ""blue"" three times.

Thus, ""walm"" before a color word signals that the next color should be repeated three times.",1.0,50,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the input and output sequences. By comparing the changes in the output in relation to the presence of the word ""walm,"" we can deduce its effect. 

Upon examining the given examples:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output sequence has an additional ""yellow"" before changing to the next color. 
   - Example: ""zup walm wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow red""
   - ""zup"" alone might give ""yellow,"" but with ""walm,"" it gives three ""yellow"" before changing.

2. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output sequence responds with additional ""green.""
   - Example: ""dax walm wif walm"" -> ""green green green red red red""
   - ""dax"" alone might give ""green,"" but with ""walm"" following, it results in three ""green.""

3. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output sequence responds with additional ""red.""
   - Example: ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow""
   - ""wif"" alone might give ""red,"" but with ""walm"" following, it produces three ""red.""

4. When ""walm"" follows a word that wasn't in the examples before it, the output color is new:
   - Example: ""zup wif walm lug"" -> ""yellow red red red blue""
   - ""lug"" has not been seen before in the input, but we see ""blue"" after ""walm"" for the first time.

Based on these observations, we can conclude that the word ""walm"" has the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" triples the response of the previous color word in the sequence. If the previous word is new or hasn't been mapped directly to a color yet, a new color is introduced in the pattern.

Thus, the rule induction for ""walm"" would be written as:

walm -> Triples the output color of the previous word or introduces a new color if the previous word's output color is unknown.",0.8,50,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently maps to the color ""blue"" in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,51,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the outputs. Every instance in the inputs where ""lug"" appears, ""blue"" is the color mentioned in the outputs.",1.0,51,lug

"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue in each example, regardless of position or combination with other words.",1.0,51,lug
"Based on the provided examples, each input word seems to correspond to a specific output color. The word ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green."" 

Looking at other words:
- The word ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red.""
- The word ""zup"" consistently results in the output ""yellow.""
- The word ""bluf"" when it occurred (in the fourth and fifth examples), the output was ""red"" and ""green"" respectively which correspond to the words preceding it (""wif"" and ""dax""). This could imply that ""bluf"" perhaps takes the color of the preceding word or duplicates it.
- The word ""lug"" only appeared once and led to the color ""blue.""

Using this analysis, we can deduce the following rule:
dax -> meaning. The meaning is ""green."" Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output will be ""green.""",1.0,51,dax

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,51,dax

"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" Each example shows that no matter the position of ""wif"" within the input sequence, the output invariably includes ""red"" in the corresponding position. Other words, such as ""lug"" and ""zup,"" correspond to ""blue"" and ""yellow"" respectively, while ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

- In the fifth input, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" translating to ""green,"" which is the color associated with ""dax.""

Taking into account these observations, we can define the meaning of ""bluf"" as such:

bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: If a color word is followed by ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" translates to that same color.",1.0,51,bluf
"To figure out the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the pattern of the inputs and outputs to spot any rules. The basic principle is to find a consistent relationship between ""bluf"" and the translation in the output.

In each instance, we can compare the word just before ""bluf"" to figure out what ""bluf"" translates to:

1. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
2. lug bluf -> blue blue
3. dax bluf -> green green
4. wif bluf -> red red

It seems that ""bluf"" duplicates the color that is translated from the word immediately before it. Here's the rule based on the given examples:

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the same color as the word preceding it.

Therefore, we can write the meaning as:

bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color of the previous word.
",1.0,51,bluf
"From the given examples, it seems like the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the color that is represented by the word that immediately precedes it. We can analyze each input and its corresponding output to extract the pattern:

- Input: zup bluf | Output: yellow yellow (bluf takes on the color yellow, which is the color of zup)
- Input: dax bluf wif zup wif | Output: green green red yellow red (bluf takes on the color green, which is the color of dax just before it)
- Input: dax zup lug bluf | Output: green yellow blue blue (bluf takes on the color blue, which is the color of lug just before it)
- Input: zup wif bluf | Output: yellow red red (bluf takes on the color red, which is the color of wif just before it)
- Input: lug wif lug dax bluf | Output: blue red blue green green (bluf takes on the color green, which is the color of dax)

By evaluating each of these, we can see that the rule is consistent across all examples. Thus, we can induce that ""bluf"" means repeating the color of the previous word.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the previous word.",1.0,51,bluf
"Bluf -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the immediate color that precedes it in the output, regardless of the word that comes before it in the input. 

Rule: The output for ""bluf"" is the same color word that immediately precedes ""bluf"" in the output sequence.",1.0,51,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, there seems to be a pattern relating the word bluf to the output generated:

1. In every case, the word that precedes bluf in the input is repeated in the output.
2. The color associated with the repeated word is what bluf translates to in the output.

Following this pattern, let's review the examples:

- In the first input, zup is followed by bluf and the output is ""yellow yellow"", so bluf means the color associated with zup, which is yellow.
- In the second input, bluf is preceded by lug, and the color blue is repeated in the output, so bluf corresponds to the color blue.
- In the third input, bluf is preceded by lug again and the color blue is repeated in the output, indicating that bluf corresponds to blue.
- In the fourth and fifth inputs, bluf follows wif and dax, respectively, resulting in red and green being repeated. Hence, bluf corresponds to red and green for each case.

Therefore, from the given examples, it can be induced that bluf represents the color word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> the color word of the word preceding bluf.",1.0,51,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"".

Input: lug wif dax zup walm  
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

Here are the rules noted for each preceding word:

- ""dax"" corresponds with ""green"".

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the output ""green red"" in all instances.",1.0,52,bluf
"To deduce the rule, let's analyze the outputs in relation to the presence of the nonce word ""bluf"" in the inputs:

1. ""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""wif"" in the first input, with the outputs being ""yellow yellow"".
2. ""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" in the second input and is followed by ""wif"" outputting ""yellow red"".
3. ""Bluf"" follows ""wif"" in the third input and results in the output ""red red"".
4. ""Bluf"" follows ""wif"" and is preceded by ""dax"" in the fourth input, resulting in the outputs ""green red red"".
5. ""Bluf"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""zup"" in the fifth input, resulting in ""green green"".

Considering these patterns, it appears that ""bluf"" is represented by the color ""red"" each time it occurs. However, we should note that when ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"", ""dax"" also translates to ""green"". When it is preceded by ""wif"", the ""wif"" translates to ""red"". When preceded by ""zup"", ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"". This would suggest that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it (if it has a color representation).

Using these observations, we can formulate the rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> takes on the color of the word that precedes it.
",0.9,52,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems as though the word 'bluf' corresponds to a color output in a series of inputs and outputs, where each other input word corresponds to a specific color output.

Let's analyze the instances where 'bluf' appears:

- In the first example, 'bluf' is preceded by 'dax zup' and followed by 'yellow yellow'.
- In the second example, 'bluf' is preceded by 'zup' and followed by 'red'.
- In the third example, 'bluf' stands alone with 'wif' and it is followed by 'red red'.
- In the fourth example, 'bluf' is preceded by 'wif' and followed by 'red green'.
- In the fifth example, 'bluf' is preceded by 'dax zup' and followed by 'green'.

To determine the rule, we notice that 'bluf' results in a color and the color that follows 'bluf' is either 'green' or 'red'. From these examples, it is not clear what specific rule 'bluf' follows, but it seems consistent that 'bluf' results in the color 'red'. However, another color follows 'bluf', which could be influenced by the word that comes after 'bluf', which isn't within the scope of what we can conclude solely from 'bluf'. Therefore, we can state the following rule:

Rule: Whenever 'bluf' appears, it seems to correspond to the color 'red'.

Hence:
bluf -> 'red'",0.8,52,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" from the provided examples, let's examine the occurrences of ""bluf"" and the associated output colors. In each case, ""bluf"" appears to be connected with the color ""red,"" but only when ""wif"" precedes it, or the next word is ""dax"".

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow"" without any clear connection to the previous or following word.
2. In the second example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the output for both is ""red.""
3. In the third example, the pair ""wif bluf"" again yields the output ""red red.""
4. The fourth example has ""wif"" followed by ""bluf"" towards the end, outing as ""red red"" once more.
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""green,"" corresponding to ""dax.""

The pattern indicates that ""bluf"" is associated with ""red"" when preceded by ""wif"" or followed by ""dax."" If ""bluf"" stands alone or is not in one of these configurations, it does not correspond to ""red,"" but instead to the second preceding or following word's output color (i.e., in example 1, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" making ""bluf"" associated with ""yellow"" as it is not directly preceded by ""wif"" nor followed by ""dax""; in example 5, ""dax"" comes after ""bluf,"" which also yields ""green"").

Based on this analysis, the rule could be stated as:

Rule: ""bluf"" outputs ""red"" when preceded by ""wif"" or followed by ""dax""; otherwise, it adopts the color output of the second word before or after it.",0.8,52,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears the word ""bluf"" corresponds to two color outputs, which are ""red"" and ""green"". However, ""bluf"" does not always give the same two color outputs; it depends on the word that precedes it. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"", the output is ""red green"". When preceded by ""wif"", the output for ""bluf"" is also ""red red."" And when ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the output is ""yellow green.""

Here is the pattern based on the examples given:

1. ""dax zup bluf"" gives the output ""green yellow yellow"", but since ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow"", ""bluf"" here must output ""yellow.""
   
2. ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red green red yellow."" In this sequence, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (first ""yellow"") and is followed by ""wif"" (""red""), ""dax"" (""green""), and ""zup"" (""yellow""). The output ""yellow red"" aligns with ""bluf""; however, since the next word is ""wif"" and it corresponds to ""red"", it is unclear if both ""reds"" originate from ""bluf"" or only one.

3. ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red,"" indicating that both instances of ""red"" are from ""bluf"" because there are no other words to consider.

4. In the case of ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax,"" the colors ""blue blue blue"" come from ""lug"" and ""walm,"" ""green"" from ""dax,"" and ""red"" from ""wif,"" which leaves ""bluf dax"" corresponding to ""red red green""; therefore, ""bluf"" followed by ""dax"" gives ""red red"".

5. Finally, ""zup dax bluf"" gives ""yellow green green,"" which means ""bluf"" here is ""green.""

Taking all this into account, ""bluf"" follows a pattern based on the previous word. Here is an attempted rule for this pattern:

- When preceded by ""zup,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow green.""
- When preceded by ""dax,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""red red.""
- When preceded by ""wif,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""red red.""

However, there's some inconsistency based on this rule, especially in the first stated point. There is not enough data to confirm the exact rule, particularly regarding what happens when ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and if it changes based on what follows ""bluf.""

A tentative rule, with the available information, could be:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" changes depending on the preceding word (context-sensitive). If ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" then the output is ""red red."" If ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red."" The meaning following ""zup"" seems to be ""yellow green,"" but it is not consistent across examples. Additional examples would be needed to confirm the pattern for when ""bluf"" follows ""zup.""",0.7,52,bluf
"Given the outputs for each input line, it seems that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. Since the input is a combination of different words and ""walm"" appears multiple times, it is reasonable to infer that ""walm"" also corresponds to a color. To figure out which color it corresponds to, we can look for patterns in each line.

- In the first line, the word ""dax"" appears once and corresponds to ""green,"" the word ""lug"" appears once and corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" appears once and also corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the second line, exactly the same words in the input give the same output as in the first line, reinforcing our idea that each word has a specific color associated with it.
- In the third line, ""zup"" appears twice and corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" appears once at the end and corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" appears once and corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the fourth line, ""wif"" appears once and corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" appears once and corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" appears once and corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" appears once and corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the fifth line, ""lug"" appears twice and corresponds to ""blue"" each time, ""wif"" appears once and corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" appears once, corresponding to ""blue.""

Through these examples, the exact meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" seems inconsistent, which makes it difficult to provide an exact rule or definition for ""walm"" based solely on color correspondence. However, if we observe the positions where ""walm"" occurs, we can notice that ""walm"" takes on the color of the immediately preceding word:

- In the first and the second lines ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the color is blue.
- In the third and the fourth lines, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the color is yellow.
- In the fifth line, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the color is blue again.

Therefore, it seems that ""walm"" may mean ""repeat the color of the preceding word.""

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,52,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the relationships between inputs and outputs. The outputs are color names, while the inputs are non-English words, including the nonce word ""walm."" By examining patterns, we can infer the following:

- ""dax"" consistently leads to ""green""
- ""lug"" consistently leads to ""blue""
- ""zup"" consistently leads to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" consistently leads to ""red""

With these associations in mind, we can attempt to deduce the rule for ""walm"":

1. When ""walm"" follows ""dax lug,"" the output is ""blue blue."" Since the presence of ""dax"" and ""lug"" already accounts for ""green blue,"" the additional ""blue blue"" appears to be due to ""walm.""
   
2. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow yellow."" Since ""zup"" accounts for ""yellow,"" the ""yellow yellow yellow"" appears to be due to ""walm.""

3. When ""walm"" follows ""wif dax zup,"" the output is ""red green yellow yellow yellow."" Since ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup"" account for ""red green yellow,"" the additional ""yellow yellow"" should be due to ""walm.""

4. When ""walm"" is between ""lug"" and ""wif lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue red blue."" By removing the known contributions of ""lug"" (""blue""), ""wif"" (""red""), and another ""lug"" (""blue""), the remaining ""blue blue"" is again due to ""walm.""

From these observations, we can formulate a rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word in the input three times.

Rule: ""walm"" -> repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",0.8,52,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it looks like the nonce word ""walm"" translates to a series of outputs that correspond to a color repeated multiple times. To understand the specific rules for ""walm"", let's examine the color repetition pattern in each example:

1. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue: Here, ""walm"" is associated with three repetitions of the color ""blue"" that immediately follows it.
2. zup walm lug -> yellow yellow yellow blue: In this case, ""walm"" produces three repetitions of ""yellow"" that come before it, followed by the color for ""lug"" which is ""blue"".
3. wif dax zup walm -> red green yellow yellow yellow: Here, ""walm"" results in three repetitions of the color ""yellow"" that precedes it.
4. lug walm wif lug -> blue blue blue red blue: ""walm"" causes three repetitions of the color ""blue"" that comes before it, and then the sequence continues normally with the color for ""wif"" which is ""red"", followed by the color for ""lug"" which is again ""blue"".

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" represents a rule where it causes the color word that immediately precedes or follows it to be repeated three times before the word sequence continues as normal.

Rule: walm -> When walm appears in a sequence, it translates to the color word immediately before or after it being repeated three times.",0.8,52,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should compare the inputs and their corresponding outputs, focusing on the presence of the word ""walm"" and its associated color in the output.

Inputs and outputs featuring ""walm"":

- dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
- zup walm lug -> yellow yellow yellow blue
- wif dax zup walm -> red green yellow yellow yellow
- lug walm wif lug -> blue blue blue red blue

Looking at the second color output for each input, the color appearing right after ""walm"" appears to repeat a number of times equal to the total number of words following ""walm"" plus one. For instance:

- In ""dax lug walm,"" there is no word after ""walm,"" so the color ""blue"" repeats once (green blue blue blue).
- In ""zup walm lug,"" one word follows ""walm,"" so ""yellow"" repeats twice (yellow yellow yellow blue).
- In ""wif dax zup walm,"" ""walm"" is the last word, so ""yellow"" repeats once (since no words follow ""walm"") (red green yellow yellow yellow).
- In ""lug walm wif lug,"" two words follow ""walm,"" so ""blue"" repeats three times (blue blue blue red blue).

With this pattern in mind, we can deduce the meaning of ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" -> The next color in the sequence is repeated a number of times equal to the number of words that come after ""walm"" plus one.",0.8,52,walm
"Examining the given examples:

1. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
2. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
3. zup walm lug -> yellow yellow yellow blue
4. wif dax zup walm -> red green yellow yellow yellow
5. lug walm wif lug -> blue blue blue red blue

It seems that the word ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color associated with the word just before it. In examples 1 and 2, ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, and thus ""walm"" leads to a repetition of blue. In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which is associated with yellow, so the output for ""walm"" is repeated yellow. In example 4, ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" (yellow), and in example 5, it comes after ""lug"" again (blue).

Using these observations, we can deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

walm -> meaning. Meaning is a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes ""walm"".

By comparing the inputs and outputs, we can establish a correspondence between these words and specific colors: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Now, let's look at ""bluf."" Each time it is used, it appears that the output is repeated:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow.""
- In the third example, ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow green yellow green red red.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif bluf lug zup"" translates to ""red red blue yellow.""

It seems that ""bluf"" makes the color that would translate from the word immediately before it repeat once.

Hence, we can deduce the rule:
bluf -> Causes the immediate previous word's corresponding color word to be repeated. Rule: When ""bluf"" is used after a word, output the color associated with that word twice.",1.0,53,bluf
"bluf -> red

Rule: Each time the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the output is ""red"". Independent of the context or the position of ""bluf"" in the sequence, it consistently translates to ""red"".",1.0,53,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to a sequence of two identical colors. These colors seem to depend not on ""bluf"" itself, but on the words preceding it. For instance, when the word before ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" the output is ""red red."" It does not matter where in the sequence ""bluf"" occurs or how many words precede it; the color repeated twice is determined by the immediate predecessor of ""bluf.""

Therefore, the rule could be stated as follows: ""bluf"" translates to two of whatever color the preceding word translates to.

Rule: bluf -> Two of the color represented by the word immediately before bluf.",1.0,53,bluf
"By analyzing the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" We must look at a series of input-output pairs to identify any patterns that allow us to determine the rule that applies when the word ""walm"" is used:

1. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
2. ""dax walm zup"" -> ""green green green yellow""
3. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
4. ""wif walm zup"" -> ""red red red yellow""
5. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""

The word ""walm"" appears in each input example and is followed by a repetition of a color in the output. The number of repeated color outputs corresponds to the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence. More specifically, the position of ""walm"" indicates the number of times the preceding color word is repeated in the output. Additionally, ""walm"" is followed by another color if there is another word after it in the input sequence. Here are the observed patterns:

- ""wif walm"" repeats ""red"" three times because ""walm"" is the second word.
- ""dax walm"" repeats ""green"" three times because ""walm"" is the second word, followed by ""yellow"" because of the following ""zup.""
- ""zup walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times because ""walm"" is the second word.
- ""wif walm zup"" repeats ""red"" three times because ""walm"" is the second word, followed by ""yellow"" because of ""zup.""
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" repeats ""green"" three times because ""walm"" is the fourth word, following ""wif bluf dax.""

Based on these observations, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the previous color word to be repeated as many times as the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence. If there is another word after ""walm,"" then that word is represented by a single color in the sequence.

Therefore:
walm -> Causes the previous color word to be repeated as many times as the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence, with an additional color added if followed by another word.",1.0,53,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" translates into multiple repetitions of a color word associated with the previous word. Let's analyze the patterns:

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, and ""walm"" seems to repeat this color three times.

Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, ""walm"" repeats this color three times, and ""zup"" translates to yellow.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and ""walm"" repeats this color three times.

Input: wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, ""walm"" repeats this color three times, and ""zup"" translates to yellow.

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
- ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""bluf"" does not seem to translate to any color as there is no output for it, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" repeats the green color three times.

Based on these examples, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" takes the color associated with the immediately preceding word (if any) and repeats it three times. If the preceding word is not associated with a color, then ""walm"" has no color output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times. If the preceding word has no associated color, there is no repetition.",0.9,53,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can look at the words that precede and follow it, and the output patterns they generate. Below is the analysis of each example:

1. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

2. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

4. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow

5. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

In each example where ""walm"" occurs, the output is a triple repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm."" If ""walm"" is followed by another word (as in examples 2 and 4), the output then appends the color associated with the following word:

- wif generates red
- dax generates green
- zup generates yellow

Following this logic, ""walm"" appears to function as a sort of duplicator or repeater for the color word that comes immediately before it. When ""walm"" is followed by another color word, that word's associated color is added once after the triple repetition.

For example, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"" because ""wif"" is associated with the color red, and ""walm"" causes it to be repeated three times. In the example ""dax walm zup,"" ""dax"" is associated with green, so with the presence of ""walm,"" it becomes ""green green green,"" and since ""zup"" is afterward, associated with yellow, that color is added once.

Rule:
walm -> Causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times. If followed by another word, the color associated with that word is added once to the end of the output.",0.8,53,walm
"Based on the given examples, the output color repeats a number of times equal to the total number of words in the input that precede ""walm."" So, when ""walm"" is used in a sentence, it seems to cause the word that corresponds to the last color mentioned to repeat as many times as there are words before ""walm.""

Let's look at the examples:

1. ""wif walm"" has one word before ""walm,"" so the output is ""red"" repeated once.
2. ""dax walm zup"" has one word before ""walm,"" so the output is ""green"" repeated once, followed by the standard ""yellow"" for ""zup"".
3. ""zup walm"" has one word before ""walm,"" hence ""yellow"" is repeated once.
4. ""wif walm zup"" has one word before ""walm,"" making ""red"" repeat once, followed by the standard ""yellow"" for ""zup"".
5. ""wif bluf dax walm"" has three words before ""walm,"" so ""green"" (which corresponds to ""dax,"" the last color word before ""walm"") is repeated three times.

Therefore, ""walm"" seems to function as a multiplier for the last color word that precedes it, based on the number of words that come before ""walm"" in the sentence.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last color word before ""walm"" in the output as many times as the number of words preceding ""walm"" in the input.",0.8,53,walm
"To find the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", let's first look for patterns in the examples given:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm"", the output is a sequence of three ""red"".
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", the output is a sequence of three ""green"".
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm"", the output is a sequence of three ""yellow"".
- The sequence ""wif walm zup"" generates ""red red red yellow"", which suggests that ""zup"" the output of ""yellow"" is appended to the output sequence generated by ""wif walm"".
- The sequence ""wif bluf dax walm"" does not generate a consistent pattern from the given rules, as ""bluf"" doesn't have a defined color output; however, ""dax walm"" does generate ""green green green"".

The word ""walm"" seems to trigger a repetition of three of the color that preceded it. Given the current examples, this is the pattern:

- ""wif"" -> red
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""zup"" -> yellow

Thus, when another word is placed directly before ""walm"", the output is three repetitions of the color corresponding to that word, and if there are additional words after ""walm"", their corresponding color is added to the sequence.

"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to result in the output of a sequence of colors, where the number of repetitions of the color corresponds to the number of terms appearing before ""walm"".

Let's examine each example:

1. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Analysis: The word ""dax"" outputs ""green"" and ""lug"" outputs ""blue,"" but since ""walm"" comes after these two, the last color (""blue"") is repeated three times.

2. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue
   Analysis: ""Walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" hence it repeats ""green"" three times. Then ""lug"" appears resulting in an additional ""blue.""

3. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Analysis: ""Zup"" gives ""yellow"" and ""wif"" gives ""red."" ""Walm"" causes ""red"" to appear three times, repeating the color that appears before it.

4. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Analysis: ""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" which outputs ""blue,"" resulting in ""blue"" being repeated three times.

5. Input: dax walm zup walm
   Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
   Analysis: The first ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and repeats it three times. The second ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and repeats it three times.

The rule seems to be that ""walm"" takes the color corresponding to the word directly preceding it and repeats that color as many times as there are total words preceding ""walm"" in the sequence.

Rule: If the word before ""walm"" corresponds to color X, and there are N words before ""walm,"" then the output is the color X repeated N times.

Input 1 & 3: The word ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (which corresponds to yellow) and results in three ""yellow"" in the output.

Input 2: In this example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" again and results in three ""yellow"" in the output, consistent with Input 1 & 3.

Input 5: In this example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (which corresponds to green) and the output is ""green blue blue blue,"" indicating that the last blue is the result of ""lug"" and not ""walm"" as it is not repeated. This means ""walm"" causes the replication of the color related to ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

The rule can be generalized as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,55,walm
"walm -> three repetitions of the last color mentioned before it.

Rule: When 'walm' appears, it causes the color represented by the word immediately preceding 'walm' to be repeated three times in the output.",1.0,55,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the preceding word in the output. To support this, let’s analyze the given examples:

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is followed by ""walm,"" which results in ""yellow"" being repeated twice more.

2. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   - Once again, ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" and in this case, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" ""Walm"" results in two additional ""yellow"" in the output.

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - Repeats the pattern identified in the first example.

4. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   - In this example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to ""blue."" ""Walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated two more times.

5. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - As in example four, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with ""blue."" Again, ""walm"" leads to ""blue"" being repeated two additional times.

By consistently repeating the color of the word that comes before ""walm"" two more times, ""walm"" seems to function as a repetition command for the most recent color mentioned.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word twice more.",1.0,55,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can see that the output consists of a sequence of color words. The nonce word ""walm"" appears in each input, and it is always translated to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the context or position. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

walm -> blue

Meaning: Walm means the color blue.",1.0,55,walm
"Observing the examples:

1. Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
2. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
3. Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
4. Input: zup dax lug walm zup -> Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
5. Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue

We can try to figure out the rule by looking at each sequence focusing on occurrences of ""walm"" and what is outputted when it appears:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears, the output is a repetition of the color that directly precedes it.
- In examples 1, 3, ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"", which results in ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In example 4, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" which has the output ""blue"", and subsequently, we get ""blue blue blue"".
- In example 5, similarly, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the output is ""blue blue blue"".
- Example 2 confirms this rule as ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the output is three times ""yellow"".

Thus, based on the examples provided, the most plausible rule we can induce for the nonce word ""walm"" is that it repeats the color immediately before it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color word that immediately precedes ""walm"" in the output sequence three times.",1.0,55,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,56,lug

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,56,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each provided example.",1.0,56,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,56,lug
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following pattern:

1. Each word in the input is mapped to a particular color in the output.
2. The word 'zup' is consistently mapped to the color 'yellow'.
3. The word 'wif' is consistently mapped to the color 'red'.
4. The introduced nonce word 'dax' is consistently mapped to the color 'green'.
5. The new word 'lug' in the final example is consistently mapped to the color 'blue'.
6. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the words and colors, suggesting that position or repetition does not alter the assigned color for each unique word.
7. No other context or modifiers seem to affect the color assignment for any given word.

Rule: dax -> green. Each unique word directly translates to a specific color regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,56,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the same position in the output.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""dax"" -> ""green""",1.0,56,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to a specific color in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green"".
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the output.
- The word ""walm"" seems to have a repetition effect on the previous color in the output, excluding ""dax"". For example, following ""zup"", it repeats the yellow, and following ""wif"", it repeats red.
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule can be formulated as:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,56,dax
"To determine the rule(s) pertaining to the nonce word ""dax,"" we should look for patterns in the Input and Output pairs. It seems that each word in the Input corresponds to a color in the Output.

Looking at the examples:

1. ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow.""
2. ""walm"" always corresponds to ""red.""
3. ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red,"" but one less ""red"" compared to ""walm."" When ""walm"" occurs on its own, it results in ""red,"" but when followed by ""wif,"" it results in an additional ""red"" beyond what ""wif"" produces on its own. So, ""wif"" ends the sequence of ""red"" and subtracts one ""red"" from the output.
4. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
5. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and shows at the beginning of the input sequence or after ""lug.""

The precise rule for ""dax"" based on the given data set is:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the context of other words.",1.0,56,dax
"Rule:
dax -> green

Based on the given examples, every instance of ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green."" The meaning of ""dax"" is not dependent on its position or the context within the input sequence. Every time ""dax"" appears in the input, it translates directly to ""green"" in the output.",1.0,56,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the word ""red"" consistently in the output. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,56,wif
Rule: wif -> 'red',1.0,56,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we'll examine its position and its corresponding outputs in each given input/output pair.

1. lug dax wif lug -> blue green red blue
2. dax walm wif walm -> green green green red red red
3. zup dax wif -> yellow green red
4. lug bluf wif -> blue blue red
5. wif dax bluf -> red green green

Here are some observations:

- ""Wif"" seems to map to ""red"" in each output, regardless of which words come before or after it.
- The positions of the other words (lug, dax, zup, etc.) correspond to their color outputs consistently when ""wif"" is not in their position.
- ""Wif"" seems to be independent of context since it consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of the preceding or proceeding words.

Based on the above observations, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be as follows:

Rule: wif -> red

Thus, ""wif"" means ""red"" in the given context.",1.0,56,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" results in the word ""red."" Taking each input and its respective output, we can deduce the following correlations:

- ""lug"" consistently correlates with ""blue.""
- ""dax"" consistently correlates with ""green.""
- ""wif"" always results in ""red.""
- ""walm"" being repeated twice correlates with a duplication of the color ""green"" then ""red.""
- ""bluf"" appears to correlate with ""blue.""

The duplication in the second example seems to be a special case related to the repetition of ""walm."" 

Thus, the general rule that can be deduced is:

Rule: wif -> ""red"".",1.0,56,wif
"By inspecting the provided examples and analyzing the inputs and outputs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""wif"". Here's the process of deduction:

1. Input: lug dax wif lug
   Output: blue green red blue
2. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
3. Input: zup dax wif
   Output: yellow green red
4. Input: lug bluf wif
   Output: blue blue red
5. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green

From examples 1 and 4, we can see that the output sequence always has ""red"" at the position immediately following the nonce word ""wif"". This suggests that ""wif"" translates directly to ""red"".

Moreover, in example 2, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" which in the output is represented by ""red red red,"" possibly implying that ""wif"" causes a repetition of the color that follows it, where the repetition count matches the number of repetitions of the preceding color (in this case, ""green"" is repeated thrice before ""wif"").

To see if this holds up, let's consider the fifth example, input ""wif dax bluf"" where ""wif"" precedes ""dax"" and is followed by ""bluf"". The output ""red green green"" seems counterintuitive if we apply the repetition rule because we'd expect ""red red green"" if ""wif"" causes a repetition of the color following it. However, in this context, ""wif"" appears at the beginning of the input, so there is nothing preceding it that would define the count of repetitions. Due to the fact that ""dax"" (green) is repeated, it may suggest the absence of a color before ""wif"" defaults to repeating the following color once, which is why we have two greens instead of one.

Additionally, looking at example 3, ""wif"" is at the end of the input after ""dax,"" and the output ends with ""red,"" maintaining the direct translation of ""wif"" to ""red"". No repetition occurs because there is no color-word following ""wif"" to be repeated.

Considering all the above deductions, we can hypothesize that ""wif"" directly translates to the color ""red"", and when used within a sequence, it may carry the property of causing a repetition of the color that follows it, with the count depending upon the immediate preceding sequence of colors.

Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color ""red,"" and ""wif"" may cause a repetition of the number of colors that follow it, equal to the count of the preceding repeated color. If ""wif"" is the first word or is placed at the end, it simply translates to ""red"" without causing any repetition.",0.8,56,wif
Rule: Zup -> yellow,1.0,56,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

The word ""zup"" in each example corresponds to the output word ""yellow.""",1.0,56,zup
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" correlates to the color ""yellow."" Whenever ""zup"" is present in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. 

Therefore, the rule is as follows:

zup -> yellow",1.0,56,zup
"Based on the examples provided, ""zup"" seems to correspond to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output. Moreover, no matter the position of ""zup"" within the input sequence, it consistently translates to ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,56,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". In every instance where ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.",1.0,56,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to correlate the positions of ""bluf"" in the inputs with the corresponding outputs:

1. dax bluf wif zup lug -> green green red yellow blue
2. wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> red red yellow red blue green
3. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
4. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
5. zup bluf -> yellow yellow

Keeping the position of ""bluf"" in mind, it appears that ""bluf"" correlates with a color in each instance. The outputs before and after ""bluf"" change, whereas the color associated with ""bluf"" remains the same. The common factor is that whenever ""bluf"" is present, the color ""yellow"" appears in the output, specifically right after ""bluf"" appears.

Therefore, based on the provided examples:

Rule: bluf -> yellow",1.0,56,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red

For example, in the input ""lug dax walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""dax"" to green. The output is ""blue green green green,"" indicating that ""walm"" extends ""dax"" (green) in the output sequence by repeating it three times.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the preceding color word's corresponding output color three times. 

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color three times.",1.0,56,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns before and after ""walm"" regarding the colors given in the output:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to blue, the output is ""blue blue blue."" Therefore, ""walm"" causes the preceding color to be repeated three times.
   
2. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which translates to green, the output is ""green green green."" Again, ""walm"" causes the preceding color to be repeated thrice.

3. The first example includes multiple words preceding ""walm,"" but only the last color (from ""lug"" -> blue) is repeated three times.

Given these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color represented by the word immediately preceding it three times in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,57,lug
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" let's compare the input with its corresponding output in each example, focusing on the instances where ""lug"" appears.

1. Input: lug dax
   Output: blue green
   - ""lug"" is followed by ""dax,"" and ""blue"" is followed by ""green.""

2. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" and ""yellow"" is followed by ""blue blue blue."" Notice that ""walm"" elsewhere corresponds with ""green,"" but after ""lug"" it repeats thrice which suggests a possible multiplication or repetition.

3. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""lug"" is followed by ""zup walm,"" and ""blue"" is followed by ""yellow yellow yellow."" Here again, we see a multiplication effect on the words following ""lug.""

4. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue red green green red
   - ""lug"" is followed by ""wif,"" and ""blue"" is followed by ""red."" ""Wif"" elsewhere corresponds to ""red,"" but this output does not exhibit repetition.

5. Input: lug bluf dax lug

   - ""lug"" leads and trails in this example, with ""blue"" at the beginning and end of the outputs and a non-repeating ""blue green"" in between suggesting that ""lug"" at the end of a sequence does not seem to affect the preceding word.

From these examples, we can see that ""lug"" makes the following color repeat. The only exception is when ""lug"" is the last word, it seems to just represent the color ""blue"" on its own. Hence, we conclude:

Input: dax lug bluf dax
Output: green blue blue green
- Once again, every instance of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" affirming the rule. ""lug"" is confirmed once more to be ""blue,"" and with ""bluf"" following the ""lug"" and also yielding ""blue,"" it seems ""bluf"" consistently translates to the same color as the preceding word.

4. Input: zup lug walm | Output: yellow blue blue blue
5. Input: wif dax zup walm | Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

Firstly, each individual word in the inputs seems to correspond to a specific color in the outputs.

Observations:

- ""wif"" always leads to ""red.""
- ""dax"" always leads to ""green.""
- ""zup"" always leads to ""yellow.""

Now, looking specifically at ""walm,"" we can see that it yields to different outputs, but notably, there's a distinct rule:

- ""walm"" always results in the color that the previous word corresponds to. 

For example:
- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" resulting in ""walm"" also being ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (a new word not seen in previous examples), which corresponds to ""blue,"" hence ""walm"" also results in ""blue.""
- In the second and third examples, ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" making ""walm"" also result in ""yellow.""

Rule: walm -> takes on the color corresponding to the previous word.",1.0,57,walm
"Based on the provided examples where the nonce word 'walm' appears, we can see a recurring pattern with its corresponding output. In each sequence, the word 'walm' is associated with the repetition of the color that immediately follows it. Here's the correlation:

- In example 1, 'walm' is followed by 'dax', which outputs ""red.""
- In example 2, 'walm' is followed by 'dax', which also outputs ""red.""
- In example 3, 'walm' is followed by 'dax', again outputting ""red.""
- In example 4, 'walm' is followed by nothing and is the last word, thus defaulting to blue, like 'lug' which precedes it.
- In example 5, 'walm' is the last word, leading to the repetition of the color that precedes 'walm', which is yellow.

Considering these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: 'walm' -> When 'walm' appears in a sequence, the output color is the same as the color associated with the word following 'walm'. If 'walm' is the last word, the output color is the same as the color associated with the word preceding 'walm'.",0.8,57,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the pattern of colors in the outputs concerning the presence of ""walm"" in the inputs.

- Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, the word immediately following it triggers a sequence of ""yellow"" in the output until a different word (""dax"" or ""wif"") appears.
- There is one exception in the last example, where ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence. In this case, ""walm"" is followed by a single ""yellow"" in the output.
- ""walm"" itself does not seem to have a direct consistent color output associated with it.

From these observations, the rule for ""walm"" could be:

Rule: Following ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow"" repeated for the next words until a word that changes the color sequence appears, such as ""dax"" or ""wif."" If ""walm"" is the last word, only one ""yellow"" is output.

Thus, we can say:

walm -> triggers a sequence of ""yellow"" in the output until a different specified word appears. If ""walm"" is the last word, it results in a single ""yellow.""",0.8,57,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at how its presence affects the corresponding output color sequence in the examples provided:

1. Input: ""wif walm dax zup""
   Output: ""red red red green yellow""
   Here, ""walm"" corresponds to the second ""red"" in the output.

2. Input: ""zup walm dax""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow green""
   In this case, ""walm"" corresponds to the second ""yellow.""

3. Input: ""zup walm dax zup dax wif""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red""
   Here, ""walm"" corresponds to the second ""yellow.""

4. Input: ""zup lug walm""
   Output: ""yellow blue blue blue""
   In this example, ""walm"" corresponds to the third ""blue.""

5. Input: ""wif dax zup walm""
   Output: ""red green yellow yellow yellow""
   Here, ""walm"" corresponds to the third ""yellow.""

Based on these examples, it seems that ""walm"" does not correspond to a specific color but might be a rule or a pattern relative to its position or the context it is in. However, the pattern is not immediately evident just from the color sequences given for ""walm.""

To discern a pattern, let's see if the position of ""walm"" within the sequence has a relationship with the output:

- In examples 1, 2, and 3, ""walm"" comes before ""dax"" and after ""wif"" or ""zup"" and corresponds to the same color as the word that precedes it.
- In example 4, ""walm"" is the last word and follows ""lug,"" resulting in an output color that is a repeat of the color corresponding to ""lug.""
- In example 5, ""walm"" is the last word and follows ""zup,"" resulting in an output color that is a repeat of the color corresponding to ""zup.""

From these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" takes the color of the preceding word in the sequence.

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" based on the given examples is:

walm -> takes the color of the preceding word.",0.8,57,walm
"Based on the inputs and outputs provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" has an effect on the color output that follows its occurrence. More specifically, ""walm"" causes the next word or words to produce a color sequence starting with ""yellow."" This pattern persists regardless of the words that follow ""walm."" Here is the pattern deduced from the examples:

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
Explanation: ""wif"" outputs red, then ""walm"" causes ""dax"" to turn to red and ""zup"" to turn green which is the color that follows red in a sequence and then yellow. 

Input: zup walm dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow green
Explanation: ""zup"" outputs yellow, then ""walm"" causes ""dax"" to output yellow and then ""zup"" is given a green which follows the yellow color in the sequence because it's after ""walm"".

Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
Explanation: ""zup"" starts the output as yellow, then ""walm"" changes the sequence to start over by making ""dax"" output yellow and the next ""zup"" to green, then ""dax"" returns to its original output of yellow and the ""wif"" in red.

Input: zup lug walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue
Explanation: ""zup"" outputs yellow, ""lug"" outputs blue, and then ""walm"" makes the output blue instead of changing it following with the word after it.

Input: wif dax zup walm
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
Explanation: ""wif"" outputs red, ""dax"" green, ""zup"" turns yellow, and then ""walm"" changes the sequence to make the following words turn yellow.

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" causes the subsequent color sequence to start with yellow regardless of the usual color output of the words that follow ""walm"". If there's more than one word after ""walm,"" the sequence continues as if starting from yellow in a sequence of colors that would logically follow, typically ""green."" However, if the word ""walm"" is followed by a word indicating a particular color, like ""zup"" (yellow) or ""lug"" (blue), it continues with that color instead. If ""walm"" comes before the word that has a set color that follows in the sequence, it makes the word turn to the color that comes before it in the sequence, like red before green.

walm -> causes the next words to output a sequence starting with yellow or makes them output the color before their default if they have one, potentially altering the usual sequence of outputs.",0.8,57,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""lug"" is consistently translated to ""blue"" regardless of the context. Therefore, the rule is straightforward:

lug -> blue",1.0,58,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.",1.0,58,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in the given examples.",1.0,58,lug
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all given outputs, regardless of the position of ""lug"" in the input string. Thus, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,58,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word 'lug' corresponds to the color 'blue'.",1.0,58,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. We can infer the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green

The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in every example where it appears.",1.0,58,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green"" regardless of its position in the input string. Whether ""dax"" is at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of the input string, it is consistently translated to ""green"" in the output.

Here's the breakdown of the patterns observed:

- ""dax lug"" -> ""green blue"": ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green green green red"": ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and the rest of the pattern is not relevant to the meaning of ""dax""
- ""dax"" -> ""green"": ""dax"" alone corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif dax"" -> ""red green"": ""dax"" is at the end but still corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug dax"" -> ""blue green"": ""dax"" is at the end but still corresponds to ""green""

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

dax -> meaning: green",1.0,58,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

The pattern shown in these examples indicates that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,58,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,58,dax
"Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be that the word ""dax"" translates to ""green"". Each example where ""dax"" is present corresponds to ""green"" in the output. Here is the breakdown:

- ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" as seen in Input 1 (""dax lug"" -> ""green blue"") and Input 5 (""lug dax"" -> ""blue green"").
- ""walm"" translates to ""green,"" since ""dax walm wif"" converts to ""green green green red,"" and it can't be ""dax"" since ""dax"" on its own is ""green"" as well.
- ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" given ""dax walm wif"" gives ""green green green red,"" and ""wif dax"" leads to ""red green.""
- When ""dax"" appears by itself, the output is solely ""green.""

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

dax -> green.",1.0,58,dax
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to ""red"" in each instance it appears.",1.0,58,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the output always includes ""red"". It seems that ""wif"" directly translates to ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,58,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word 'wif' consistently translates to the color 'red' in all provided examples, regardless of the context or the other words present.",1.0,58,wif
"Based on the examples provided, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of its position in the input string or the context provided by other words. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

wif -> red

Rule: ""wif"" means ""red.""",1.0,58,wif
"wif -> red

Based on the examples provided, whenever the word ""wif"" is present, the output consistently includes the word ""red."" This indicates that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. There are no examples contradicting this association, so the rule appears to be straightforward:

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""",1.0,58,wif
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow in the given examples.",1.0,58,zup
"zup -> meaning: yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,58,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow each time it appears. Regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present, ""zup"" consistently results in ""yellow"" in the Output.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,58,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that:

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Thus:

zup -> yellow",1.0,58,zup
"zup -> yellow. 

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.",1.0,58,zup
"Based on the given examples, each instance of ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. The rule seems to be consistent across different combinations of words. There is no context given that changes the output associated with ""bluf."" Additionally, the word preceding ""bluf"" does not seem to affect its corresponding output. Therefore, the induction suggests that:

Rule: bluf -> red",1.0,58,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at each input and its corresponding output to identify patterns.

1. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

2. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red

3. Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red

4. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

5. Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
   Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow

Based on these examples, it appears that each word before ""bluf"" has a color associated with it. When ""bluf"" is used, it repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Therefore, the rule is:

bluf -> meaning. The word ""bluf"" indicates to repeat the color of the word directly preceding it.

Rule: If a word 'X' has a corresponding color 'Y', then 'X bluf' would be 'Y Y'.",1.0,58,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, each instance of the nonce word ""bluf"" is followed by a color. Comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs, we can deduce that the appearance of the word ""bluf"" always results in the output ""red"". It seems that other words in the input correspond to other colors. For example, ""wif"" also results in the output ""red"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""dax"" to ""green"".

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be consistently associated with the color red.

Rule: bluf -> red",1.0,58,bluf
"bluf -> red

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, it translates to ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,58,bluf
"The nonce word ""bluf"" seems to correlate with the color that is mentioned twice in sequence in the output. Looking at the first input-output pair:

- ""wif bluf"" gives ""red red,"" suggesting ""bluf"" means ""red.""

However, examining across multiple examples:

- The input ""lug walm wif bluf"" results in ""blue blue blue red red."" Here, ""bluf"" is paired with ""red"" again at the end, suggesting a pattern where ""bluf"" represents a repetition of the previous color.
- The pattern is consistent in the third example: ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" yields ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red,"" where ""bluf"" repeats the preceding color.
- The fourth example is identical to the first, reinforcing the rule.
- Lastly, ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" outputs ""green yellow blue yellow yellow,"" again following the rule.

Rule: bluf -> repetition of the previous color in the sequence.",1.0,58,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's break down the patterns found in the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: dax walm wif dax
   Output: green green green red green
2. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
3. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
4. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow
5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

Looking at these examples, we can see that each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output:
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

In each case where ""walm"" appears, all other words that appear before ""walm"" in the sequence are repeated in the output before the sequence diverges with a new color. This suggests that ""walm"" prompts a repetition of the colors corresponding to the words that preceeded ""walm"" in the sequence, up to that point. After ""walm"" executes its function, the pattern of colors resumes as direct mappings from the remaining words in the input sequence:

1. ""dax"" is green, so, after ""dax walm"", we have ""green green green"" and then the pattern diverges with ""wif dax"" becoming ""red green"".
2. ""lug"" is blue, ""zup"" is yellow, so ""lug zup walm lug"" becomes ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"", with repetition of ""blue yellow"" followed by ""lug"".
3. ""dax"" being green and ""lug"" being blue, after ""dax lug walm,"" we get ""green blue blue blue"", then the pattern changes with ""zup wif"" becoming ""yellow red"".
4. ""dax"" is green and ""wif"" is red, so after ""dax walm,"" we have ""green green green"" and the pattern changes with ""wif zup"" being ""red yellow"".
5. ""lug"" is blue, therefore, ""lug walm"" simply translates to ""blue blue blue"", with the repetition of ""blue"".

Given the patterns in the outputs and the specific function of ""walm"" in facilitating this repetition, we can define:

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning. Causes the repetition of the colors that correspond to the preceding words, up to the point where ""walm"" appears. After ""walm"" has been used, the output reverts to direct color translations of the remaining words.",1.0,58,walm
"Based on the examples provided, one can deduce that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color translation of the word that immediately precedes it, until a new color word appears. Looking closer at each example:

- In the first example, ""dax"" which translates to green is immediately followed by ""walm"", resulting in repeated ""green"" until the next color word ""wif"" which translates to red.
- The second example shows ""lug"" which translates to blue, followed by ""walm"", which again leads to repeated ""blue"" until the end because there's no new color word.
- Similarly, the third example has ""lug"" (blue) followed by ""walm"" resulting in repeated ""blue"" until ""wif"" which changes the output to red.
- The fourth example again shows ""dax"" (green) followed by ""walm"" repeating green until ""zup"" translates to yellow.
- The last example has ""lug"" (blue) followed by ""walm"" with repetition of blue until the end.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word until a new color word appears.",1.0,58,walm
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word three times.,1.0,58,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word before 'walm' the number of times corresponding to the number of words after 'walm' plus one. 

For example:

- In ""dax walm wif dax"", 'dax' corresponds to 'green'. There are two words after 'walm', so 'green' is repeated two times plus one, for a total of three greens, followed by the colors for 'wif' and 'dax' (red and green, respectively).

- In ""lug zup walm lug"", 'zup' which is before 'walm', corresponds to 'yellow'. There is one word after 'walm', so 'yellow' is repeated one time plus one, for a total of two yellows, followed by the color for 'lug' (blue).

- In ""lug walm"", 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'. There are no words after 'walm', so 'blue' is repeated zero times plus one, for a total of one blue.",1.0,58,walm
"Based on the given examples, walm appears to be an instruction to repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word two extra times. Let's examine:

- dax => green (first occurrence is followed by walm, thus repeated twice)
- walm => not directly translated; represents the instruction to repeat the preceding color (green in this case)

- dax => green (first occurrence followed by walm, thus repeated twice)
- walm => not directly translated; represents the instruction to repeat the preceding color (green in this case)

- zup => yellow

Output: green green green red yellow

Input: lug walm
- lug => blue (first occurrence followed by walm, thus repeated twice)
- walm => not directly translated; represents the instruction to repeat the preceding color (blue in this case)

- ""zup wif walm"" leads to ""yellow red red red,"" implying ""wif"" is associated with the color red, repeated three times, while ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow, not repeated.
- ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" includes multiple words followed by ""walm"" and without ""walm."" Here ""lug walm"" again causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times, ""wif"" results in ""red"" repeated twice, and ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, which appears without repetition when ""walm"" is not following it.",1.0,59,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we need to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" Let's look at each example and the associated output:

1. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   
2. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   
3. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   
4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   
5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

In each of these cases, the word ""walm"" translates to three repetitions of a color in the output. The specific color that ""walm"" is translated to seems to be dependent on the words that precede it. For examples 1 and 5, the word ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output is ""blue"" three times. In example 2, ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output is ""red"" three times.

Additionally, the color preceding ""walm"" appears to be a direct color word translation from the word immediately before it (""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red"").

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times. If the preceding word is a nonce word that translates to a color, then repeat that color.",1.0,59,walm
"walm -> Rule: The word ""walm"" translates to repeating the color associated with the word just before it three times. In the given examples, ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue and ""wif"" corresponds to the color red; therefore, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" and ""zup wif walm"" leads to ""yellow red red red"" where ""yellow"" is associated with ""zup.""

Each instance of the word ""dax"" in the examples is translated to the color ""green"".",1.0,60,dax

"From the given examples, it's possible to deduce that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. No matter the context in the input, whenever ""dax"" appears, the output includes ""green"". Therefore, the rule underlying this problem is straightforward:

"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the given examples and their outputs. We notice that whenever ""wif"" is present, the color ""red"" appears in the output. Moreover, ""wif"" does not appear to have a positional effect on the output, as it can be at the start or in the middle of the input, but ""red"" consistently appears in the output.

Furthermore, the examples do not show a case where ""wif"" corresponds to more than one particular color or set of colors other than ""red."" Therefore, based on the given data, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> ""red""",1.0,60,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that ""wif"" translates to ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.

- The word ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""blue"" like ""lug,"" indicating that ""bluf"" is also an alternative indication for ""blue.""

- ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"", which suggests that ""zup"" means ""yellow"" irrespective of the following word, as ""bluf"" does not appear to influence the meaning of ""zup.""
- ""zup dax wif"" translates to ""yellow green red"", and ""zup"" precedes ""dax"" to become ""yellow,"" further supporting that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

- ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red"": 'bluf' follows 'wif' which corresponds to the colour red, and the output for 'bluf' is 'red' repeated once.
- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"": 'bluf' follows 'zup' which corresponds to yellow, and the output for 'bluf' is 'yellow' repeated once.
- ""wif zup dax bluf"" -> ""red yellow green green"": 'bluf' follows 'dax' which corresponds to green, and the output for 'bluf' is 'green' repeated once.
- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"": 'bluf' follows 'dax' which corresponds to green, and the output for 'bluf' is 'green' repeated once.

- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green.""

The word ""bluf"" seems to dictate that the color word associated with the preceding word is doubled in the output.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately before bluf.",1.0,60,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the meaning of ""bluf"" seems to be contingent on the word that precedes it. If we look at each pair of input and output sequences, we can identify the following relationships:

- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow"" repeated once for each occurrence of ""bluf.""
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red"" repeated once for each occurrence of ""bluf.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green"" repeated once for each occurrence of ""bluf.""

Therefore:

zup -> yellow
wif -> red
dax -> green

It appears that ""bluf"" mirrors the color associated with the preceding word. To put this in a rule format: 

Rule: bluf -> the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it, repeated for the number of times ""bluf"" appears in sequence.",1.0,60,bluf
"From the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" is repeated in the output for as many unique words that appear before it in the input. Here is the rule induction based on the examples:

- When ""zup wif bluf"" is the input, ""yellow red red"" is the output. Here ""bluf"" corresponds to two colors because there are two unique words ""zup"" and ""wif"" before ""bluf"".
- When ""zup bluf"" is the input, ""yellow yellow"" is the output. ""bluf"" corresponds to two yellows because ""zup"" is the only unique word before ""bluf"".
- When ""wif zup dax bluf"" is the input, ""red yellow green green"" is the output. ""Bluf"" corresponds to two greens because there are three unique words ""wif"", ""zup"", and ""dax"" before ""bluf"".
- When ""dax bluf"" is the input, ""green green"" is the output. ""Bluf"" corresponds to two greens because ""dax"" is the only unique word before ""bluf"".
- When ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" is the input, ""green red green yellow yellow"" is the output. ""Bluf"" corresponds to two yellows because there are three unique words ""dax"", ""wif"", and ""zup"" before ""bluf"", but ""dax"" is repeated so it is only counted once.

Given the above information, ""bluf"" translates into a repetition of the color related to the last unique word mentioned before ""bluf"", equal to twice the number of unique words.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the last unique word before ""bluf"" for twice the number of unique words present before ""bluf"" in the sequence.",0.8,60,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs to find a pattern.

Looking at each input and output:

1. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
   This suggests that ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" might mean repeating the color word that precedes it twice more, since ""yellow"" is repeated three times in total.

2. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
   Here ""dax"" seems to mean ""green"" and ""lug"" means ""blue,"" following the rule that ""walm"" repeats the color word that precedes it twice more, ""blue"" is repeated three times.

3. dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue blue yellow red
   In this one, ""dax"" still means ""green"" and ""lug"" still means ""blue."" ""Walm"" repeats the ""blue"" twice more. ""Zup"" means ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" introduces a new color ""red.""

4. zup walm dax -> yellow yellow yellow green
   ""Zup"" means ""yellow,"" ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" twice more, and ""dax"" is ""green.""

5. zup bluf lug zup walm -> yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   Here, ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" seems to be a typo or another word meaning ""yellow."" ""Lug"" means ""blue,"" but there is no ""blue"" after ""lug,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" is not related to the output color ""blue."" This confirms that ""walm"" repeats the previous color, which is ""yellow"" in this case, twice more.

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it two more times.

Thus:
walm -> Repetition of the preceding color word two more times.",1.0,60,walm
"walm -> The meaning of the word ""walm"" appears to be an instruction to repeat the color associated with the preceding word the number of times given by the length of the word ""walm"" minus one. In this case, ""walm"" has four letters, so the preceding color is repeated three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the color associated with the preceding word is repeated (length of ""walm"" - 1) times.",1.0,60,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" results in the word ""yellow"" being repeated a number of times. The number of repetitions of ""yellow"" corresponds to the number of words that precede ""walm"" in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" means to output the word ""yellow"" repeated as many times as there are words before ""walm"" in the input sequence.

Hence:
walm -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the word ""yellow"" for each word preceding ""walm"".",1.0,60,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to mean ""repeat the last color mentioned before it.""

Evidence:
1. In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" is translated as ""yellow,"" and after ""walm"" is used, ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
2. In ""dax lug walm,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and following ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated four times, as ""dax"" is ""green.""
3. In ""dax lug walm zup wif,"" ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to repeat four times, after ""lug,"" then ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red"" without any repetition.
4. In ""zup walm dax,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and gets repeated three times after ""walm,"" then ""dax"" translates to ""green"" without repetition.
5. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""zup"" before ""walm"" translates to ""yellow,"" and then ""yellow"" is repeated three times, indicating that ""walm"" is causing the ""yellow"" to repeat.

Therefore, walm -> repeat the last color mentioned before it.",0.8,60,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the patterns of inputs and corresponding outputs:

1. ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow.""
2. ""dax lug walm"" corresponds to ""green blue blue blue.""
3. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" corresponds to ""green blue blue blue yellow red.""
4. ""zup walm dax"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow green.""
5. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow.""

Here are some observations:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears, a series of identical color words follow in the output.
- The number of colors in the output matches the total number of words in the input, including ""walm.""
- The color repeated in the output matches the color that ""zup"" stands for, when ""zup"" appears before ""walm."" When ""zup"" does not appear before ""walm,"" the repeated color seems to be the color corresponding to the word directly preceding ""walm"" (except for the last example, which might indicate ""bluf"" does not have a designated color and is ignored or is also yellow).
  
Putting these observations together, it seems that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of a certain color word in the output, and the specific color to be repeated likely depends on the word that comes immediately before it or a default color if no color word precedes it.

Based on the examples provided:

- Example 1 shows that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and since it precedes ""walm,"" we see ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- Example 2 introduces ""dax lug"" before ""walm,"" and the output is ""green blue blue blue,"" with ""blue"" being repeated following ""lug.""
- Example 3 adds another word at the end, ""wif,"" which is red, but ""walm,"" still causes the preceding color to repeat multiple times.
- Example 4 shows ""walm"" after ""zup"" leads to the repetition of ""yellow,"" and then ""dax"" at the end provides the single ""green.""
- Example 5 is somewhat inconsistent with other examples because ""bluf"" doesn't seem to have a corresponding color in the output, suggesting that the word does not change the outcome or is also associated with ""yellow."" The presence of two ""yellows"" before and after ""bluf"" might indicate ""bluf"" is ignored, or ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"" is taking precedence.

Rule: Walm -> Causes the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it to repeat in the output for the number of total words present in the input, unless preceded by ""zup,"" which takes precedence and repeats ""yellow."" If the preceding word is not associated with a specific color, ""walm"" defaults to yellow or the preceding color word's color.",0.8,60,walm

"To deduce the meaning of ""wif"" we need to carefully compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs, looking for a pattern. 

Looking at the examples:

1. ""lug dax bluf wif dax"" becomes ""blue green green red green."" The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" as seen consistently across the examples. The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" ""bluf"" has appeared twice, corresponding to ""green"" when before ""wif"" and ""red"" after ""wif."" Thus, ""wif"" appears to cause the color that follows it to be ""red"" instead of its usual corresponding color.

2. ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red green red red."" Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green"" again, and ""bluf"" which would be ""green"" normally is ""red"" after ""wif"" again. Thus ""wif"" seems to change the following color to ""red.""

3. ""wif dax lug dax"" becomes ""red green blue green."" Here, ""wif"" precedes ""dax"" which again results in ""red.""

4. ""dax wif bluf"" leads to ""green red red."" ""Dax"" is once again ""green,"" and ""wif"" before ""bluf"" turns ""bluf"" into ""red."" 

5. ""wif walm"" turns into ""red red red."" This example doesn't provide much new information as both occurrences of the nonce word correspond to ""red.""

From these examples, the rule is consistent: when ""wif"" precedes another word, it changes the color this word would usually correspond to into ""red.""

Rule: wif -> Turns the following word's corresponding color into red.",1.0,61,wif
"Observing the examples given, the word 'wif' seems to coincide with the color 'red'. The output always includes 'red' whenever 'wif' is present in the input.

"Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule of the nonce word ""wif"" by looking at both the input and output patterns:

Input: lug dax bluf wif dax

Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
Output: yellow red green red red

Input: wif dax lug dax
Output: red green blue green

Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

In every instance where ""wif"" appears, it translates to ""red"" in the output. Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" can be deduced as:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,61,wif
"Analyzing the given examples where the nonce word 'wif' appears, we can try to deduce its meaning or rule based on common patterns that occur with its usage.

Looking at the outputs, it is observed that 'wif' correlates with a color in the output. However, 'wif' does not always map to the same color, so we need to figure out the rule governing its meaning.

1. In the first example, ""wif"" appears between ""bluf"" and ""dax."" Since ""bluf"" relates to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" it seems that ""wif"" could refer to ""red,"" since ""wif dax"" results in ""red green.""

2. In the second example, ""wif dax"" again maps to ""red green,"" and ""wif bluf"" maps to ""red red,"" which would imply ""wif"" could be interpreted as ""red"" each time before a color, changing the subsequent color to ""red.""

3. In the third example, ""wif dax"" maps to ""red green,"" consistent with the previous interpretation.

4. In the fourth example, ""dax wif"" maps to ""green red,"" supporting the interpretation that ""wif"" turns the subsequent color to ""red.""

5. In the fifth example, ""wif walm"" maps to ""red red red,"" suggesting that ""wif"" not only changes the following item to ""red"" but may also represent ""red"" by itself.

Based on these observations, we can postulate a tentative rule:

Rule: ""wif"" changes the color of the word that follows it to ""red."" When ""wif"" appears before a color word, it turns that color word into ""red."" When ""wif"" stands alone or is not directly followed by a known color word, it represents the color ""red"" by itself.

Therefore, the rule would be:

wif -> Turns the following color word to red, or represents the color red if standalone or followed by an unknown color term.",0.8,61,wif
"After reviewing the given examples, the rule appears to be that ""wif"" acts as a modifier, specifically duplicating the color that follows it. When a color word follows ""wif,"" the output color is doubled.

Examples:
1. ""lug dax bluf wif dax"" translates to ""blue green green red green"". Here, ""wif dax"" results in ""red green"", with the ""green"" being duplicated by ""wif"".
2. ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" yields ""yellow red green red red"". In this case, ""wif dax"" leads to ""red green"" and ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"".
3. ""wif dax lug dax"" gives ""red green blue green"" where ""wif dax"" turns into ""red green"".
4. ""dax wif bluf"" turns into ""green red red"", with ""wif bluf"" converting to ""red red"".
5. ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"", showing that ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> duplicates the color word that follows it. If no color word follows, the default color duplicated seems to be ""red"".",0.8,61,wif

"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the nonce word ""walm"" indicates that the color associated with the word immediately following ""walm"" should be repeated three times in the output. The pattern showcases that whatever color is mapped to the word after ""walm,"" it is the color that's tripled in the output sequence. Each word (lug, dax, wif, zup) maps to a color (blue, green, red, yellow) and ""walm"" seems to affect only the word right after it.

Here's how we can break down the examples:

1. `wif walm lug bluf` translates to `red red red blue blue` because ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""walm"" causes the next color (from ""lug"" which corresponds to blue) to repeat three times, and ""bluf"" seems to be a non-mapped or misspelled word, assuming it corresponds to the color blue as well.

2. `dax walm zup lug walm` translates to `green green green yellow yellow yellow blue blue blue` because ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""walm"" causes the next color (from ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow) to repeat three times, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and the second ""walm"" causes the next color (again from ""lug"") to repeat three more times.

3. `lug walm dax` translates to `blue blue blue green green green` because ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" causes the next color (from ""dax"" which corresponds to green) to repeat three times.

4. `dax walm wif` translates to `green green green red red red` because ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" causes the next color (from ""wif"" which corresponds to red) to repeat three times.

5. `zup walm` translates to `yellow yellow yellow` because ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""walm"" causes the next color, which in this case isn't present, so it repeats the color for ""zup"" three times.

Rule: walm -> When following ""walm,"" the color corresponding to the next word repeats three times.",1.0,61,walm

- In the first example, 'wif walm lug bluf' translates to 'red red red blue blue,' meaning 'wif' corresponds to 'red,' 'lug' translates to 'blue,' and 'walm' causes 'red' to be repeated three times due to 'wif' preceding it.
- The second example 'dax walm zup lug walm' becomes 'green green green yellow blue blue blue,' indicating 'dax' corresponds to 'green,' 'zup' translates to 'yellow,' 'lug' still is 'blue,' and 'walm' has caused 'green' to repeat three times and 'blue' to repeat three times after their respective nonce words.
- In the third example, 'lug walm dax' results in 'blue blue blue green,' where 'walm' has caused 'blue' to repeat three times following 'lug.'
- The fourth example 'dax walm wif' results in 'green green green red,' suggesting that 'walm' made 'green' appear three times after 'dax.'
- Lastly, the example 'zup walm' translates to 'yellow yellow yellow,' where 'walm' has caused 'yellow' to repeat three times following 'zup.'

Given these observations, the rule seems to be that 'walm' causes the color associated with the immediately preceding nonce word to repeat three times. Therefore, the meaning of 'walm' can be deduced as follows:

Rule: walm -> triggers the repetition of the color associated with the preceding nonce word three times.",1.0,61,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to act as an amplifier or multiplier of the color associated with the preceding word. Here is an analysis of each case:

1. ""wif walm lug bluf"" translates to ""red red red blue blue"". Without ""walm,"" it seems ""wif"" would map to a single ""red"" and ""lug"" to a single ""blue"". However, ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word twice more, leading to a triple instance of the color.

2. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue blue blue"". ""dax"" alone might map to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"". The ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in two more ""green,"" and the one after ""lug"" results in two more ""blue.""

3. ""lug walm dax"" translates to ""blue blue blue green"". Here ""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" again triples the color representation.

4. ""dax walm wif"" translates to ""green green green red"". ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and ""wif"" with ""red."" ""walm"" triples the instance of green.

5. ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"". ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" triples the yellow.

Explanation of the rule: 
In all instances provided, whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding output. Moreover, ""dax"" does not seem to affect the translation of other nonce words in the sequence; it consistently translates as ""green"" regardless of its position or the presence of other words.

Therefore, the observed rule is:

"Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule for what ""dax"" means in relation to the output:

Each instance of the word ""dax"" in the input corresponds to ""green"" in the output. Here's the breakdown of the examples provided:

Example 1:
Input: dax zup lug wif lug
Output: green yellow blue red blue
Here, ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green"" in the output.

Example 2:
Input: dax lug dax lug walm
Output: green blue green blue blue blue
The first and third ""green"" in the output correspond to the first and second ""dax"" in the input, respectively.

Example 3:
Input: wif dax
Output: red green
Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" which is the second color in the output.

Example 4:
Input: dax
Output: green
The single ""dax"" in the input corresponds to the single ""green"" in the output.

Example 5:
Input: dax walm

1. In the first example, ""zup dax lug zup"" corresponds to ""yellow green blue yellow"". Here, ""zup"" appears at the beginning and the end, corresponding to ""yellow"" at those positions.

2. In the second example, ""lug zup walm lug"" corresponds to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" again, and it seems that ""walm"" after ""zup"" may be resulting in repetition of ""yellow"".

3. In the third example, ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" corresponds to ""green yellow red red blue"". Again, ""zup"" takes the place of ""yellow"".

4. The fourth example, ""lug zup dax lug"", turned into ""blue yellow green blue"". As before, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

5. Finally, in ""wif walm zup walm"", the output is ""red red red yellow yellow yellow"". Here, we see that ""zup"" follows the pattern of translating to ""yellow"", and is again followed by repetitions of the subsequent color, in this case ""yellow"".

"Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce what ""zup"" means in this context. 

Let's look at each input and output pair to discern a pattern:

1. wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> red green red red yellow red
""The word zup causes a yellow to appear in the sequence.""

2. dax zup -> green yellow
""Here, after the word dax (which results in green), zup turns the next color to yellow.""

3. wif walm zup lug zup walm -> red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
""Zup follows a walm and a red, and both times it leads to a yellow output. It precedes lug, with no apparent effect on it. After zup, walm repeats its output more times.""

4. dax zup dax walm -> green yellow green green green
""Again, zup follows dax, resulting in a yellow. Walm after dax multiplies the instance of green.""

5. dax walm wif walm zup -> green green green red red red yellow
""In a mixed sequence, zup follows a walm and again results in a yellow. Walm is seen to repeat the color before it multiple times, which explains the red repetition.""

A pattern emerges where ""zup"" consistently results in the output ""yellow"". It seems to introduce yellow regardless of what has come before it. This suggests that the meaning for ""zup"" is straightforward:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow"" 

Meaning: When ""zup"" appears in the input, the word itself translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the pattern of colors before it.",1.0,63,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's examine its occurrence and the corresponding output in different examples:

Example 1: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
Output: red green red red yellow red
Here, ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" when preceded by ""bluf.""

Example 2: dax zup
Output: green yellow
Here, ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" again, and it follows ""dax.""

Example 3: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
In this example, ""zup"" occurs twice. The first ""zup"" follows ""walm"" and leads to ""yellow,"" and the second ""zup"" follows ""lug"" and results in a repeated ""yellow.""

Example 4: dax zup dax walm

Example 5: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow
Here, ""zup"" is at the end following a ""walm"" and still results in ""yellow.""

From these examples, it's clear that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the output of ""yellow,"" regardless of the context in which it's used. The rule for ""zup"" seems to be straightforward—it does not depend on what precedes or follows it.

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" appears to be:
zup -> yellow.",1.0,63,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""zup"" appears to translate into an output that alters in color based on the context of the words that come before it. To determine the rule that governs the meaning of ""zup,"" let’s examine each input and corresponding output closely:

1. For ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"", the colors before ""zup"" are red, green, red, red and after ""zup"" we have yellow followed by red. ""Zup"" here results in a yellow, which is different from any of the colors that precede it.

2. For ""dax zup,"" the color before ""zup"" is green, and after ""zup"" we have yellow. Again, ""zup"" results in a yellow, different from the preceding green.

3. For ""wif walm zup lug zup walm,"" we have colors red, red before the first ""zup,"" which is followed by a yellow. After ""lug"" (blue), there's another instance of ""zup"" which produces a yellow followed by two yellows for ""walm."" In this case, ""zup"" seems to be a trigger for a sequence of yellows following a blue or a repeated yellow after a red.

4. For ""dax zup dax walm,"" the sequence is green, yellow after the first ""zup,"" and green followed by three greens for ""dax walm."" Here, ""zup"" again results in yellow, different from the green before it, but it's not immediately followed by blue (to produce multiple yellows).

5. For ""dax walm wif walm zup,"" we have green, green, red, red before ""zup,"" and after ""zup"" there is a yellow followed by another yellow. Once again, ""zup"" triggers yellow that repeats if preceded by reds or a single blue.

With these observations, we can induce that the general rule for the meaning of ""zup"" is:

zup -> meaning: yellow.

However, it also appears that ""zup"" can affect the following colors:

- If ""zup"" follows a ""red"" or sequence of ""reds,"" it produces a yellow that repeats for the number of consecutive ""reds"" preceding it.
- If ""zup"" follows a ""walm"" (blue), it triggers a sequence of yellows of at least two.

Rule:
- ""zup"" results in a yellow color.
- The number of yellows ""zup"" produces is one plus the number of consecutive ""reds"" that come before it, or if followed by blues, it results in double yellows.",0.8,63,zup
"To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" I will analyze the patterns corresponding to the outputs provided for each input.

1. In the first example, ""zup"" follows ""bluf"" and precedes ""wif,"" and the corresponding output is ""red green red red yellow red."" Each ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the ""dax"" before the ""zup"" corresponds to ""green."" The ""zup"" output is ""yellow,"" which here replaces a single ""red."" 

2. The second example shows that ""dax zup"" corresponds directly to ""green yellow,"" suggesting that ""zup"" itself translates to ""yellow.""

3. The third example begins with two ""wif"" which are ""red red,"" followed by a ""walm zup lug zup walm,"" corresponding to ""red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, we notice that after the actions of ""zup,"" every repeated word multiplies its occurrence in the output. Therefore, ""zup"" could imply a repetition or multiplicative rule.

4. In the fourth example, ""dax zup dax walm"" translates to ""green yellow green green green."" Once again, ""zup"" seems to double the subsequent output for the repeated word ""dax.""

5. In the fifth example, ""dax walm wif walm zup"" corresponds to ""green green green red red red yellow."" The last ""walm"" before ""zup"" has its output ""red"" tripled in the output, which aligns with the previous observation of a multiplicative effect.

The rule that can be deduced here:
- ""zup"" causes the output of the next ""walm"" or ""dax"" sequence to duplicate if there's only one repetition or triplicate if there are two repetitions.

So ""zup"" seems to imply a rule that multiplies the output color of the next respective word (either ""dax"" or ""walm""), based on the number of times it occurs consecutively before ""zup.""

Rule: zup -> Causes the next word's output to multiply based on the number of consecutive appearances of that word before ""zup"". If ""wif"" follows, then it generates ""yellow"" without causing multiplication.",0.8,63,zup
"Considering the examples provided, we can attempt to analyze the patterns for each input and the corresponding output to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""zup.""

1. In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" After ""zup,"" the next ""wif"" results in ""yellow"" instead of ""red."" This suggests that ""zup"" might be causing some change in the subsequent color.

2. In the second example, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and following ""zup,"" it does not appear again, but the output is ""yellow."" So, ""zup"" itself might be represented by ""yellow.""

3. The third example shows ""wif"" corresponding to ""red,"" and after ""zup,"" ""lug,"" which hasn't appeared before, is associated with ""blue."" Importantly, ""walm"" appears twice after ""zup,"" and each occurrence produces a double ""yellow."" This indicates that ""zup"" might cause a repetition effect.

4. In the fourth example, ""dax walm"" before ""zup"" gives ""green green green,"" and after ""zup,"" ""dax"" gives a single ""green,"" not modifying the previous interpretation of ""dax."" However, there's no repition as seen before, so repetition might not be directly related to ""zup.""

5. The final example starts with ""dax walm wif walm,"" which gives ""green green green red,"" and after ""zup,"" ""walm"" results in ""red yellow."" The ""red"" here replaced the expected ""green"" from ""walm,"" while ""yellow"" follows, which may suggest that ""zup"" once again alters the subsequent outputs.

From these observations, we can generalize that ""zup"" precedes a change in upcoming outputs, although the nature of that change varies. The most consistent pattern is that ""zup"" itself corresponds to ""yellow."" Additionally, ""zup"" generally seems to affect the color that is produced after it, but the rule for this change is not clear from the examples. It does not always cause repetition, nor does it consistently change the subsequent color to ""yellow.""

Based on the evidence, the most concrete rule we can state is:

Whenever ""walm"" immediately follows another word, it takes on the color output of the preceding word. In other words, ""walm"" acts as a repeater of the color output for the word that comes before it.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color output of the preceding word.",1.0,63,walm
"walm -> meaning. Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to change the color associated with each word that follows it to red, up until a word is repeated or another nonce word appears, after which the pattern changes. For example:

- In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" which turns green to red.
- In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" (which was previously green) and turns it red.
- In the third example, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" and ""lug"" has not appeared before, so it turns red.
- In the fourth example, only ""dax"" follows ""walm,"" and it turns red.
- In the fifth example, no word follows ""walm,"" hence there is no color change evident after ""walm.""

Conclusion: walm -> Causes the following words to change their associated color to red until a word repeats or another nonce word is encountered.",0.8,63,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the output colors beside each instance of ""walm"" and consider the context provided by the other words in the input.

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

In the first two inputs, ""walm"" is flanked by ""dax"" and ""wif"" - when ""walm"" is in the middle, the color before ""walm"" is green, and the color after it is red. This consistency suggests that ""walm"" might relate to a color rule transition between other elements.

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

In the last three inputs, ""walm"" appears at the end or near the end, accompanied by ""wif"" before it. In every occurrence of ""walm,"" red directly follows ""wif."" This might imply that ""walm"" enforces or emphasizes the red color rule after ""wif"" but does not by itself correspond to a new color.

Combining all observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" doesn't have a direct color associated with it but seems to play a role in ensuring that ""wif"" converts to red when it precedes ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> emphasizes or ensures that the color directly preceding it is red (specifically when ""wif"" precedes ""walm"").",0.8,63,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine how the sequence of output colors changes in the presence of ""walm"" in the various inputs.

Let's associate each input word with its corresponding output color:

- ""dax"" -> green
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""lug"" -> blue

Now, let's look for patterns when ""walm"" is present:
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the next color is red.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the next color is also red.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the next color is red.
- When ""walm"" is in the third position following ""wif"" and another word, it does not lead to the color blue (based on the first and the third examples).

We have an instance of ""walm"" that is not immediately followed by a color (the third input-output pair: ""zup wif walm lug"" -> ""yellow red red red blue""), suggesting ""walm"" might not correspond directly to ""red,"" but rather affects the color that follows it.

However, in every example where ""walm"" is present, irrespective of its position or the words around it, the output color immediately after is red, except when followed by ""lug,"" which outputs blue. This suggests that ""walm"" could be indicative of the output color red, but with an exception to this rule when followed by a particular word (like ""lug"").

Since ""lug"" has a recorded output color of blue and is the only word that follows ""walm"" without resulting in red immediately after, the rules might be more complex and context-dependent.

Given the limited data and without a clear exception pattern beyond ""lug,"" the simplest rule that fits the provided data is:

Rule: ""walm"" is followed by the color red unless it is followed by ""lug,"" in which case it is followed by the color blue.

Hence:
walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: ""walm"" signals that the next color will be red except when followed by ""lug,"" which changes the output to blue.",0.8,63,walm
"lug -> blue
Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.",1.0,64,lug
"Rule: In the context of these examples, the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Therefore, lug -> blue.",1.0,64,lug
"Based on the given examples, it appears that 'lug' is consistently associated with a single color in the output regardless of its position or the presence of other words. No matter the context, 'lug' always results in ""blue"" in the output. There's no variation in the output color linked to 'lug' as it stands alone or with other words (which themselves translate to different colors).

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,64,lug
"lug -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the color ""blue"" is in the same position in the output. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,64,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The term ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the given examples.",1.0,64,lug
"From the provided examples, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to a color output in each case. Let's examine each instance:

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
- Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""green."" Since ""dax"" is followed by two ""greens,"" it may mean ""green"" in this context.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- ""Walm"" is associated with ""green,"" and so is ""dax"".

Input: dax wif
Output: green red
- ""Wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and ""dax"" is associated with ""green"".

Input: dax lug wif lug
Output: green blue red blue
- ""Lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and ""dax"" is associated with ""green.""

Input: dax zup
Output: green yellow
- ""Zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" is associated with ""green.""

Based on all inputs and outputs, it appears that regardless of the context, ""dax"" consistently results in the color ""green."" Therefore the rule would be:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,64,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following patterns for the word ""dax"" in the context of this problem:

- Whenever ""dax"" is used, the output begins with ""green.""
- ""dax"" does not seem to be influenced by the words that follow it, as the color that follows ""green"" in the output depends on the word after ""dax"" rather than ""dax"" itself.

This suggests that ""dax"" consistently translates to the output color ""green,"" irrespective of context within the given examples.

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green",1.0,64,dax
"Rule:

Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""dax"" appears to correlate with the color green in the output sequence. Each instance of ""dax"" in the input is consistently translated to ""green"" in the output. The colors following ""dax"" seem to correspond to the subsequent words in the input sequence: ""wif"" correlates with red, ""lug"" with blue, and ""zup"" with yellow. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

dax -> green",1.0,64,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green every time it is mentioned. Here's the deduction:

- Every example containing ""dax"" produces an output that starts with green.
- In the second example, ""dax walm"" yields two greens, suggesting that both ""dax"" and ""walm"" mean green.
- In the third example, ""dax"" is paired with ""wif,"" and the output is green followed by red, indicating that ""dax"" is green and ""wif"" is red.
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" precedes colors that we can infer based on previous examples (""lug"" being blue and ""wif"" being red). ""Dax"" here is again followed by green, consistent with our other findings.
- In the last example, ""dax zup"" results in green followed by a new color, yellow. It is the first time ""zup"" is used, but ""dax"" once again aligns with green.

Thus, the rule seems to be as follows:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.",1.0,64,dax
"From the given examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" correlates to the output ""green."" Each example where ""dax"" is present, the corresponding output includes ""green.""

Looking at the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" implying that ""walm"" also likely correlates with the color ""green.""
2. ""dax wif"" leads to ""green red,"" suggesting that ""wif"" correlates with ""red.""
3. ""dax lug wif lug"" gives ""green blue red blue,"" thus ""lug"" could correspond with ""blue.""
4. ""dax zup"" outputs ""green yellow,"" so ""zup"" might be associated with ""yellow.""

With these correlations, it seems that ""dax"" directly translates to ""green"" in the output, independent of context. Here is the rule based on the available information:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,64,dax
"wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the given examples.",1.0,64,wif
"wif -> red

"wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.",1.0,64,wif
"Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" each time it appears in the input. This indication is consistent and does not seem to change depending on context or position in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,64,wif

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""",1.0,64,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Here is the direct association:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the outputs provided.",1.0,64,zup
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,64,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: Each instance of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,64,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" correlates with a specific color in the output. In each example where ""zup"" is present in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Therefore, it can be deduced that:

"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""zup"" maps to a specific color each time it is mentioned. In every instance, ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,64,zup
"Analyzing the given examples, each instance of ""bluf"" corresponds to a color output that is the same as the color immediately preceding it. Below are the examples annotated with their corresponding colors:

1. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
   Output: red yellow yellow red green
      - ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow.

2. Input: zup bluf wif walm

3. Input: dax bluf wif zup

      - ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to blue.

5. Input: wif zup dax bluf
   Output: red yellow green green
      - ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to green.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the word preceding it.",1.0,64,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze how the output changes with respect to its position and surrounding words.

1. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
   Output: red yellow yellow red green

2. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

3. Input: dax bluf wif zup
   Output: green green red yellow

4. Input: dax lug bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue green

5. Input: wif zup dax bluf
   Output: red yellow green green

Looking at the examples, we see that the output color changes in a manner that seems to be independent of ""bluf."" Instead, ""bluf"" appears to dictate the repetition of the color word that comes right before it:

1. Right before ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""bluf"" we see ""yellow"" again.
2. Right before ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" and once again we see ""yellow"" twice in a row.
3. Right before ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""bluf"" we see ""green"" again.
4. Right before ""bluf"" is ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""bluf"" we see ""blue"" again.
5. Right before ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" producing ""green,"" followed by ""green"" after ""bluf.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" causes the color word before it to repeat, regardless of what that color is. Hence,

bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color indicated by the word immediately before ""bluf"".

Rule: If the word before ""bluf"" corresponds to a certain color, the output after ""bluf"" will be the same color again.",1.0,64,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the position of ""bluf"" in the various inputs and the corresponding outputs to determine its rule.

Let's analyze each case:

1. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
   Output: red yellow yellow red green
   Here ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""yellow.""

2. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   ""Bluf"" corresponds to the second ""yellow.""

3. Input: dax bluf wif zup
   Output: green green red yellow
   ""Bluf"" corresponds to the second ""green.""

4. Input: dax lug bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue green
   ""Bluf"" corresponds to the second ""blue.""

5. Input: wif zup dax bluf
   Output: red yellow green green
   ""Bluf"" corresponds to the second ""green.""

Based on the evidence provided, ""bluf"" results in a repeated color that is attributed to the word preceding it. 

Rule:
bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the previous word.

Example to further illustrate:
If the input were ""lug bluf wif"", the output should be ""blue blue red"" as ""bluf"" would correspond to the second ""blue,"" following the pattern that ""bluf"" means to repeat the color of the word before it.",1.0,64,bluf
"Given the examples, it seems that the word 'bluf' does not have a direct one-to-one correspondence with a single color. Instead, its meaning might be contextually dependent on the words around it. Let's examine the patterns:

- When 'bluf' follows the word 'wif', the output color is 'yellow'.
- When 'bluf' follows the word 'zup', the output color is 'yellow'.
- When 'bluf' follows the word 'dax', the output color is 'green'.
- When 'bluf' is preceded by the word 'lug', the output color is 'blue'.
- When 'bluf' follows the word 'dax', in the first position, the output color is 'green'.

Taking these examples into account, it appears that 'bluf' takes the output color of the word immediately before it in the input sequence, except when preceded by 'lug', where it outputs 'blue' which doesn't follow the previous deduction. Let's assume 'lug' is an exception to the rule for now. Based on the examples we could suggest:

Rule: 'bluf' outputs the same color as the word before it, with the special case when preceded by 'lug', which results in 'blue'.",0.8,64,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of bluf, we look at the association between the input words and their corresponding output colors. Let's organize the information we have:

1. wif -> red
2. zup -> yellow
3. dax -> green
4. lug -> blue
5. bluf -> ?

Now let's analyze each example separately to figure out the rule for the word bluf:

- Example 1: ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" maps to ""red yellow yellow red green."" Since wif is red and dax is green, when bluf follows zup, it takes the color of the word that comes after it, which is red.
- Example 2: ""zup bluf wif walm"" maps to ""yellow yellow red red red."" Since wif is red and zup is yellow, when bluf follows zup, it matches the color of zup. 
- Example 3: ""dax bluf wif zup"" maps to ""green green red yellow."" Since dax is green and wif is red, when bluf follows dax, it takes the color of dax, which is green.
- Example 4: ""dax lug bluf dax"" maps to ""green blue blue green."" There doesn't seem to be a pattern here related to the colors before or after bluf, as lug is blue but bluf maps to blue as well, regardless of the next word being dax, which is green.
- Example 5: ""wif zup dax bluf"" maps to ""red yellow green green."" Since dax is green, when bluf comes after dax, it takes on the same color.

From these examples, bluf seems to take the color of the word preceding it. The fourth example is slightly confusing, but it might be because bluf does not have a preceding color word to mimic, resulting in a default blue. However, without further examples, it is hard to determine why exactly bluf is blue in that context. The default color assumption is not strong, as we would need at least another instance where bluf does not have a preceding color word to confirm this rule. It could also be simply a coincidental pattern for that example.

Based on the consistent patterns in other examples, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf takes on the color of the word preceding it. If it does not have a preceding color word, it may default to blue, but additional examples would be needed to confirm this.

So, the meaning assigned to bluf based on the given examples would be:

bluf -> takes on the color of the word immediately before it.",0.8,64,bluf
"Rule: walm -> the color associated with the previous word repeated three times. 

If the previous word is ""zup,"" the associated color is yellow, hence ""walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow."" If the previous word is ""dax,"" the associated color is green, so ""walm"" results in ""green green green."" The rule consistently applies in the examples provided, where ""walm"" repeats the color related to the word that comes right before it in a series of three.",1.0,64,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the previous word in the input three times.

""walm"" -> meaning. ""walm"" causes the previously mentioned color to be repeated three times.",1.0,64,walm
"Rule: walm -> ""repeat the color of the previous word three times"".

The word ""walm"" seems to trigger the repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it, and it causes that color to be repeated three times in the output. Here are the mappings from the examples given:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", when followed by ""walm"", the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and when ""zup walm"" immediately follows ""dax walm"", the output is ""green green green yellow yellow yellow"", indicating that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color preceding it three times.
- In the example ""dax zup dax walm"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and after ""walm"" the output is ""green green green"", which again is three times the color associated with the word just before ""walm"".",1.0,64,walm
"Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word three times. 

Based on the examples, whenever the word ""walm"" follows another word (zup, dax, etc.), the color corresponding to that previous word is repeated three times. Here are the mappings from the inputs to outputs that support this rule:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Therefore, every time ""walm"" appears after one of these words, the output is the color of the preceding word repeated three times.",1.0,64,walm
"walm -> repeat the color of the last word preceding ""walm"" three times.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" appears in a sequence, the output is the color associated with the immediately preceding word, repeated three times. For example, if ""zup"" (which outputs ""yellow"") precedes ""walm,"" the output will be ""yellow yellow yellow."" If ""dax"" (which outputs ""green"") precedes ""walm,"" the output will be ""green green green.""",1.0,64,walm
"Rule: Based on the provided examples, ""lug"" appears to map to the output ""blue."" Each instance where ""lug"" is present in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output. Thus:

lug -> blue",1.0,65,lug
"To determine the meaning of ""lug,"" let's compare the outputs for the inputs where ""lug"" appears:

1. dax lug dax wif dax -> green blue green red green
2. wif walm lug bluf -> red red red blue blue
3. zup lug -> yellow blue
4. zup wif bluf zup lug -> yellow red red yellow blue
5. wif lug zup -> red blue yellow

Looking at these examples:

- When ""lug"" immediately follows ""dax,"" the color blue comes after green.
- When ""lug"" immediately follows ""walm,"" two colors appear: red followed by blue.
- When ""lug"" is at the end of a sequence after ""zup,"" blue is the output.
- When ""lug"" stands alone between ""zup"" and ""wif,"" or ""wif"" and ""zup,"" blue is once again the resulting color.
  
Considering that ""lug"" consistently results in the output of blue, regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words, we can deduce that ""lug"" correlates to the color blue.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,65,lug
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""lug"" can be determined as follows:

- Whenever ""lug"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""blue.""
- When ""lug"" follows ""wif,"" the output is also ""blue.""
- ""lug"" after ""zup"" results in ""blue"" as well.
- There isn't a clear influence on ""lug"" from the word that follows it, only the words that precede it.

Since ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"" regardless of the preceding word (""dax,"" ""wif,"" or ""zup""), we can deduce:

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,65,lug
"lug -> meaning. From the examples provided, when the word ""lug"" is used, the output always includes the color blue. Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.

Rule: lug means blue.",1.0,65,lug
"To determine the meaning of ""lug,"" let's look for patterns in the example outputs associated with the word's position in the input.

1. In the first example, ""dax lug dax wif dax"" translates to ""green blue green red green."" We can note that the word preceding and following ""lug"" is ""dax,"" which translates to ""green."" Thus, in this context, ""lug"" is between two identical color translations and its output is ""blue.""

2. In the second example, ""wif walm lug bluf"" translates to ""red red red blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" is immediately followed by ""bluf,"" which translates to ""blue."" The output for ""lug"" is again ""blue"" and leads into another ""blue."" 

3. The third example, ""zup lug,"" translates to ""yellow blue."" ""lug"" follows ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" and its output is ""blue.""

4. The fourth example, ""zup wif bluf zup lug,"" translates to ""yellow red red yellow blue."" This again ends with ""lug,"" and its translation is ""blue.""

5. Finally, in the fifth example, ""wif lug zup"" translates to ""red blue yellow."" ""lug"" follows ""wif"" (""red"") and is followed by ""zup"" (""yellow""), and its output is ""blue.""

Based on these examples, it seems that ""lug"" always translates to ""blue,"" irrespective of the preceding or following words. Therefore, the rule for ""lug"" is consistent across all provided contexts.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,65,lug
"dax -> green

wif -> red

Meaning that whenever ""wif"" is used in the input, the word ""red"" is included in the output.",1.0,65,wif
"Based on the examples, ""wif"" invariably results in the output ""red."" In each sentence, regardless of the other words present, the inclusion of ""wif"" adds the color ""red"" to the output sequence. The meaning of ""wif"" is not changed by the context or the order of the elements:

Rule:
wif -> red",1.0,65,wif
"From the given examples, we can deduce a pattern for ""wif"" and its resulting output. Here's an analysis of each input and its corresponding output:

- Input: ""zup wif"" → Output: ""yellow red""
- Input: ""lug walm zup wif"" → Output: ""blue blue blue yellow red""
- Input: ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" → Output: ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red""
- Input: ""wif dax"" → Output: ""red green""
- Input: ""wif"" → Output: ""red""

In each output, the word ""red"" is present when ""wif"" appears in the input. This pattern is consistent irrespective of the position of ""wif"" in the input sequence. Additionally, ""wif"" tends to precede other colors in the sequence; when it appears at the beginning, it results in ""red"" alone (as in the last input), and when it precedes another word, that word's color is listed after ""red"".

Based on this, we can induce a rule where ""wif"" translates to the color ""red,"" and it may act to reset or precede the color pattern that follows it in the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> ""red""",1.0,65,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" translates to the single color ""red.""

Here is the rule induction based on the examples:

- Whenever ""wif"" is present alone, it results in ""red"" as the sole output (5th example).
- When ""wif"" follows other nonce words, it ends with ""red"" but is preceded by a series of other colors corresponding to those nonce words (1st, 2nd, and 3rd examples). 
- Even if ""wif"" precedes another nonce word, it is represented as ""red"" followed by the color representing the succeeding nonce word (4th example).

"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be that it translates into a color word that is repeated twice. However, the color it translates to depends on the word immediately preceding it. Here are the associations based on the given examples:

- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" so when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it means ""red.""

- After ""lug,"" bluf means ""blue.""
- After ""wif,"" bluf means ""red.""
- After ""dax,"" bluf means ""green.""

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" is context-dependent on the preceding word, translating to a color word that is repeated.",1.0,65,bluf
"bluf -> repeats the color indicated by the preceding word. Rule: If the preceding word specifies a color (lug means blue, wif means red, dax means green, zup means yellow), then bluf takes that color and repeats it in the output.",1.0,65,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" changes depending on the word that comes before it. Rule:

- When preceded by ""lug,"" ""bluf"" means ""blue.""
- When preceded by ""wif,"" ""bluf"" means ""red.""
- When preceded by ""dax,"" ""bluf"" means ""green.""
- When preceded by ""zup,"" and followed by ""wif,"" ""bluf"" means ""red.""

Overall, ""bluf"" seems to mean that the word's color should be repeated according to the preceding word's associated color: lug -> blue, wif -> red, dax -> green, and zup wif -> red.",1.0,65,bluf
"walm -> repeated color of the immediately preceding word

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" is used, it takes on the meaning of the word immediately before it in the sequence and repeats the corresponding color for that word three times.",1.0,65,walm
"Based on the given examples, it can be deduced that ""walm"" stands for three repetitions of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here is the rule based on the examples:

- wif walm -> red red red
- dax walm -> green green green
- zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
- lug walm -> blue blue blue

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be: repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,65,walm
"Rule: walm -> same color as the previous word repeated three times.

- In the first example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red,"" indicating that ""walm"" represents three instances of the color mentioned just before ""walm,"" which is red.
- In the second example, ""dax walm wif"" translates to ""green green green red,"" reinforcing the idea that ""walm"" means repeating the color of the preceding word three times, which is green.
- In the third example, ""dax zup walm wif"" translates to ""green yellow yellow yellow red,"" demonstrating the pattern that ""walm"" follows the color of the directly preceding word, which is yellow.
- In the fourth example, ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" translates to ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow."" ""Walm"" continues to repeat the color of the word right before it, which is yellow, three times.
- In the last example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" again showing that ""walm"" represents three instances of the preceding color, which is blue.

Therefore, the deduced rule for the nonce word ""walm"" is that it means you should repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,65,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the output color pattern for ""walm"" is triplicated (repeated three times) of the color associated with the preceding word. To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the color outcomes from each input example:

1. Input: wif walm -> Output: red red red
   Here, the word before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" and the color ""red"" is produced three times.

2. Input: dax walm wif -> Output: green green green red
   ""Walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is ""green"" repeated three times, indicating that ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green.""

3. Input: dax zup walm wif -> Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   ""Walm"" comes after ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow"" three times, suggesting that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

4. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm -> Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   ""Walm"" follows the second ""zup,"" and we see ""yellow"" repeated three times (we already inferred that ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow"" from the previous example).

5. Input: lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue
   ""Walm"" comes after ""lug,"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times.

Given this information, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,65,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to cause the output to repeat the color linked to the last word before ""walm"" multiple times. To be precise, ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word three times. The mapping of words to colors appears to be as follows based on the sequence provided:

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

Now, applying the observed rule to the examples:

1. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   (""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" repeats the red color three times.)

2. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   (""dax"" corresponds to green, ""walm"" repeats the green color three times, followed by the red color for ""wif"".)

3. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

4. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow

   Examples: ""zup wif"" -> Output: ""yellow red""

3. When ""wif"" is repeated (as in ""lug wif bluf lug wif""), the pattern is the associated color, then ""red,"" followed by repetition of these colors. It results in the sequence of the colors without ""wif"" and adds ""red"" after each color corresponding to a word before ""wif.""
   Example: ""lug wif bluf lug wif"" -> Output: ""blue red red blue red""

Considering the consistency across examples, we can generalize a rule for ""wif"":

Rule: wif acts as an indicator to add the color ""red"" to the output sequence, following a pattern that corresponds to the previously mentioned colors or repeats the word's associated color if no color word precedes it.

The third example, ""zup wif lug wif,"" yields ""yellow red blue red,"" with ""zup"" being the first color corresponding to ""yellow.""

In the fourth example, ""wif walm zup walm"" translates to ""red red red yellow yellow yellow,"" and here, ""zup"" seems to correspond to three ""yellow"" in a row, but considering the other examples, it's more likely that ""walm"" corresponds to two ""reds.""

- In the second example, ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow,"" with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue,"" once again indicating ""zup"" as ""yellow.""
- The third example further supports this, as ""zup wif lug wif"" becomes ""yellow red blue red,"" where ""zup"" is the only new word and corresponds with the new color ""yellow"" in the output.
- The fourth example strengthens this rule, showing ""zup"" as the last word of three, translating to the last two ""yellow"" outputs, suggesting that ""zup"" may mean just ""yellow"" or a double ""yellow"" when at the end of a list. For consistency with the other examples, we can assume it's simply ""yellow.""

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's observe the pattern of output colors corresponding to each word:

Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow

Here, we see ""dax"" corresponds to three greens, and ""walm"" to three reds. ""Zup"" corresponds to yellow.

Input: dax walm lug
Output: green green green blue

Here, ""dax"" again corresponds to three greens, and ""lug"" to blue.

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

""dax"" corresponds to a green, ""wif"" to red, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""bluf"" is similar to ""zup"" with an additional yellow.

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green

""lug"" corresponds to three blues, and ""dax"" to a green.

Input: lug walm wif zup wif
Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

""lug"" corresponds to three blues, ""wif"" to red, and ""zup"" to yellow.

Based on these examples, it appears that each word is associated with a specific color. The word ""walm"" consistently results in an output of reds. Given this pattern, here is the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> red

It appears that ""walm"" triggers a sequence of the same color, and since every instance of ""walm"" is followed by reds, we can deduce that ""walm"" signals red.",1.0,66,walm
"The nonce word ""walm"" appears to correlate with the color ""green."" Every time ""walm"" is mentioned in the input, a number of ""green"" appears in the output and it's always in a sequence of three greens. This pattern repeats consistently across the examples provided. Therefore, based on the given examples, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" corresponds to the repeated sequence of the color green three times.

Rule: walm -> green green green",1.0,66,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we will look at how the word patterns and colors correspond in each example:

Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds to three greens.
- ""walm"" appears two times, each followed by ""red"".
- ""wif"" follows ""walm"" and precedes it, correlating it with red.
- ""zup"" is associated with yellow.

Input: dax walm lug
Output: green green green blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to three greens again.
- ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" and before ""lug"", with no color between them.
- ""lug"" is associated with blue.

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
- Here, ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""wif"" to red, and ""zup"" to yellow.
- ""walm"" comes after ""wif"" and is associated with multiple reds.

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green
- ""lug"" is associated with blue.
- ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" and does not correlate with an immediate color.
- ""dax"" follows ""walm"" and corresponds to green.

Input: lug walm wif zup wif
Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue, followed by ""walm"".
- ""wif"" follows ""walm"" and is associated with red.
- ""zup"" is between two instances of ""wif,"" and it is associated with yellow.

From the repeated patterns, it seems that ""walm"" does not have a fixed color associated with it. Instead, ""walm"" may indicate a repetition of the color associated with the word that follows it. For instance:
- In the first example, ""walm wif"" results in repeating red, and ""walm zup"" is not directly observed (as ""wif"" is in-between).
- In the second example, ""walm"" falls before ""lug,"" leading to a repetition of blue.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" precedes ""dax,"" but we don't see a direct color associated with it; however, in the presence of ""walm,"" the normal sequence of colors seems to extend or repeat the previous color.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" triggers a repetition or continuation of the color associated with the word that follows it. Hence,

Rule: walm -> triggers the repetition or continuation of the color associated with the next word.",0.9,66,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the placement of the word in relation to the corresponding output colors and consider any patterns that may emerge.

1. In the first input, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif walm zup,"" and the output colors are three greens followed by a red, another red, and finally a yellow.
2. In the second input where ""walm"" appears only once after ""dax,"" the output is three greens followed by a blue.
3. In the third input, ""walm"" appears after ""wif"" and the output sequence ends with four consecutive reds.
4. In the fourth input, ""walm"" directly follows ""lug,"" and results in three blue colors, followed by a green.
5. In the last input, ""walm"" is between ""lug"" and ""wif"" with outputs of three blues, a red, a yellow, another red.

From these examples, we can observe that the output color sequence always starts with three repeated colors matching the word that comes right before ""walm.""

Therefore:

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the result is three greens, indicating that ""walm"" here indicates repetition of the color associated with ""dax.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the result is three blues, meaning ""walm"" after ""lug"" indicates repetition of the color associated with ""lug.""

Another important observation is that the presence of the word ""walm"" means that the color sequence resulting from the word before ""walm"" is repeated three times. The word after ""walm"" does not seem to directly influence the number of colors, but rather the specific colors that follow are dependent on the word itself.

Given the patterns, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> indicates repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it, repeating that color three times in the sequence.

Considering this definition, each instance of ""walm"" would mean ""repeat the previous color three times.""",0.9,66,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can make the following observations:

1. Whenever the word ""walm"" appears after ""dax"", the color sequence starts with three greens. This could suggest that the word ""walm"" means green when it follows ""dax"".

2. When ""walm"" appears after ""lug"", the color sequence starts with three blues. This suggests that ""walm"" takes on the meaning of blue when it follows ""lug"".

3. When ""walm"" is present at the end of a sequence with ""wif"" preceding it, the colors red are repeated in succession, except when it precedes ""zup,"" which then leads to a yellow. It's not perfectly clear what ""walm"" means in this context, but it does seem to emphasize or extend the sequence of the color indicated by ""wif,"" which is red.

From these observations, we can construct the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to mimic or repeat the color of the word that precedes it (either ""dax"" or ""lug""), but when it follows ""wif,"" it often results in one or more additional reds, unless interrupted by ""zup,"" which yields a yellow. Thus, ""walm"" may signify a repetition or continuation of the prior color or an indication to repeat the prior color pattern.

"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following patterns:

- Each non-wif word seems to correlate with a specific color. 
  - ""dax"" correlates with green.
  - ""walm"" correlates with green.
  - ""zup"" correlates with yellow.
  - ""lug"" correlates with blue.

- wif always results in the output red.

Therefore, it appears that ""wif"" consistently correlates with the color red, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,67,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif"" from the given examples, we first observe the output in each case where ""wif"" appears:

1. Input: dax walm wif zup

2. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm

   Output: yellow red
   
4. Input: wif lug dax lug
   Output: red blue green blue
   
5. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red

Looking at these examples, we notice that ""wif"" always corresponds to the output ""red"". It does not appear to affect the color assigned to the words following it, nor is it dependent on the position in the sequence. Each word or set of words corresponds to a specific color: ""dax walm"" consistently produces ""green green"", for example. ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green"".

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""wif"" always corresponds to the color ""red"", regardless of its position or the words around it.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,67,wif

- ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green"".
- ""walm"" consistently maps to ""green"".
- ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue"".
- ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow"".

The word ""wif"" always precedes a color that doesn't follow the pattern of the word that comes after it. For example, in the first input, ""wif zup"" leads to ""red yellow"" instead of ""yellow yellow"", and in the second input, ""wif lug"" results in ""red blue"" instead of ""blue blue"". 

Therefore, it appears that ""wif"" indicates a change in the expected sequence, introducing an anomaly in the color pattern—in this case, changing the following word’s associated color to ""red"".

- `zup wif` -> `yellow red`
- `wif lug dax lug` -> `red blue green blue`
- `zup dax walm lug wif` -> `yellow green green green blue red`

Observations:
1. In the first and second examples, the sequence ""dax walm wif"" consistently translates to ""green green green red.""
2. The word following ""wif"" directly corresponds to a color.
3. In the third example, ""wif"" precedes a single word and the output contains ""red"" followed by another color, suggesting that ""red"" might be the representation for ""wif.""

Based on these observations, it seems that ""wif"" acts like a marker that changes the next word's output to ""red."" In other words, the presence of ""wif"" directly before a word appears to modify the expected output of that word to ""red.""

Based on these observations, ""zup"" consistently results in ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of other words present or their order.

Rule: zup -> yellow",0.8,67,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately follows it. 

For instance:

- In the first example, ""dax bluf zup"" translates to ""green green yellow,"" where ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.
- In the second example, ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" translates to ""red blue blue red yellow,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of ""wif,"" which is red.
- Similarly, in the third, fourth, and fifth examples, ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that follows it: ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""zup"" respectively, which correspond to the colors green, yellow, and yellow respectively.

So the rule can be stated as:

bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is the color of the word that follows it.

Rule: The color assigned to ""bluf"" is the same as the color assigned to the next word in the sequence.",1.0,67,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the patterns in the input and output sequences.

1. In the first and fourth examples, ""dax bluf zup"" consistently results in ""green green yellow."" This suggests that ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" when directly following ""dax"" and directly before ""zup.""

2. The second example, ""wif lug bluf wif zup,"" results in ""red blue blue red yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""wif,"" and the output associated with ""bluf"" is blue. This could imply that ""bluf"" has the same color output as the word immediately preceding it.

3. In the third example, ""lug bluf dax lug"" leads to ""blue blue green blue."" Again, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and translates to ""blue,"" consistent with the rule deduced from the second example.

4. The fifth example, ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax,"" gives us ""red red yellow red blue green."" In this sequence, ""bluf"" is again followed by ""zup,"" but instead of matching ""zup's"" color (yellow), it matches the preceding color, which is ""wif's"" red.

From these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color of the word that precedes it.

Hence the rule is:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the color associated with the word preceding bluf.",1.0,67,bluf
"The word ""bluf"" transforms into a color based on the word that immediately precedes it. Here is how the rule appears to work based on the given examples:

1. When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the colour is green.
2. When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the colour is red.
3. When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the colour is blue.

Given this pattern, the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" is: 

Rule: bluf produces a color that depends on the word that comes immediately before it: ""dax"" leads to green, ""wif"" leads to red, and ""lug"" leads to blue.",1.0,67,bluf
"Analyzing the provided examples, we look for patterns between the inputs and their corresponding outputs to determine the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""bluf"":

1. Input: dax bluf zup
   Output: green green yellow

2. Input: wif lug bluf wif zup
   Output: red blue blue red yellow

3. Input: lug bluf dax lug
   Output: blue blue green blue

4. Input: dax bluf zup
   Output: green green yellow

5. Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
   Output: red red yellow red blue green

From these examples, we observe that the color corresponding to the word ""bluf"" is always the same as the color corresponding to the word immediately before it. In examples 1 and 4, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and so ""bluf"" is also ""green."" In example 2, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" is ""blue,"" and example 3 confirms this pattern. Example 5 also shows that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and thus ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red"" right after it.

Rule: bluf -> The word ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word that precedes it.",1.0,67,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns associated with its use across the different inputs and the corresponding outputs.

First, we note that each instance of ""bluf"" in the inputs is consistently resulting in the output ""green."" Moreover, it seems that other words (""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""lug"") have their own corresponding colors that do not change based on their position in the input sequence:

- ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" always corresponds to ""blue""

Since ""bluf"" consistently outputs ""green,"" which is the same color output as ""dax,"" we can hypothesize that ""bluf"" directly corresponds to the same concept/color since no other context is changing this output.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:
Rule: bluf -> green",0.8,67,bluf
"From the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" affects the repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it. The number of repetitions seems to relate to the number of letters in the color word itself. Here's the breakdown:

- Example 1: ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow"" has 6 letters; therefore, it is repeated 3 times (half the number of letters).
- Example 2: ""dax walm"" -> ""green"" has 5 letters; therefore, it is repeated 3 times (half the number of letters, rounded up).
- Example 3: ""wif walm"" -> ""red"" has 3 letters; therefore, it is repeated 3 times (the number of letters).
- Example 4: ""zup walm"" within a longer string still results in ""yellow"" being repeated 3 times, and ""dax walm"" results in ""green"" being repeated 3 times.
- Example 5: ""dax walm"" repeats ""green"" 3 times based on the rule deduced.

The rule seems consistent whether or not other words follow ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color that immediately precedes ""walm"", for a number of times equal to half the number of letters in the color word (rounded up if necessary).",1.0,67,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's first look at the correlated outputs and try to associate them with the given input examples. The outputs consist of colors, and according to the examples, the number of colors in the output corresponds to the number of words in the input plus some repetitive pattern.

Let's break the examples down to see if we can find the association for ""walm"":

1. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
2. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
3. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
4. wif zup walm dax zup -> red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
5. lug zup dax walm -> blue yellow green green green

We can observe the following patterns and correlations:
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" as seen in all instances where ""zup"" corresponds to a ""yellow"" in the output.
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" as seen in all instances where ""wif"" corresponds to a ""red"" in the output.
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" as seen in all instances where ""dax"" corresponds to a ""green"" in the output.
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" as seen in instance 5 where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Now focusing on the outputs after the word ""walm"":
- In the first example, ""walm"" results in two additional ""yellow"" hence ""walm"" seems to cause the word before it to repeat two more times.
- In the second example, ""walm"" results in two additional ""green,"" which follows the same rule.
- In the third example, ""walm"" results in two additional ""red,"" again supporting the rule.
- In the fourth example, the pattern continues with an additional ""yellow"" before moving to the next word, which is not ""walm,"" hence ""walm"" still causes the preceding word to repeat but doesn't affect words coming after it.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" again results in two more ""green,"" which is consistent with the pattern.

The consistent rule we can deduce is that ""walm"" seems to cause the color associated with the word directly before ""walm"" to be repeated two more times in the output.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to repeat two additional times in the output.",1.0,67,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color associated with the previous word, three times. To derive the rule for ""walm,"" we must determine the color associated with each preceding word.

From the examples, we can deduce:

- ""zup"" associates with yellow
- ""wif"" associates with red
- ""dax"" associates with green
- ""lug"" associates with blue

Now, let's apply this to the examples:

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Association: ""zup"" is yellow, followed by ""walm,"" which repeats the yellow three times.

2. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   Association: The last word before ""walm"" is ""dax"" which is green, followed by ""walm,"" which repeats the green three times.

3. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Association: The last word before ""walm"" is ""wif"" which is red, followed by ""walm,"" which repeats the red three times.

4. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   Association: The last word before the first occurrence of ""walm"" is ""zup"" which is yellow, so ""walm"" repeats the yellow three times. After that, ""dax"" is green, and ""zup"" is yellow without ""walm"" repetition.

5. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green
   Association: The last word before ""walm"" is ""dax"" which is green, followed by ""walm,"" which repeats the green three times.

So, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> When preceding a nonce word ""walm,"" repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,67,walm
"Based on the provided examples, ""walm"" seems to be associated with a repeated color output. Let's examine the patterns:

1. ""zup"" consistently generates the output ""yellow"".
2. ""wif"" consistently generates the output ""red"".
3. ""dax"" consistently generates the output ""green"" when it follows ""walm"".
4. The word preceding ""walm"" influences the color that is repeated.
5. ""lug"" generates the output ""blue"" only in the provided instance.

Given these observations, it is possible that ""walm"" serves as a command to repeat the color linked to the immediately preceding word a variable number of times, with the total number of repetitions equal to the sum of repetend words plus one.

Let's verify this against the examples:

- **Example 1:** ""zup walm"" output is ""yellow yellow yellow"". ""Zup"" correlates to ""yellow"", so following the rule, ""walm"" results in two additional ""yellows"" for a total of three.
- **Example 2:** ""wif bluf dax walm"" output is ""red red green green green"". ""Bluf"" is a nonce word with no output associated, and may be ignored as noise. ""Wif"" correlates to ""red"", and ""dax"" correlates to ""green"". After ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated twice more, for a total of three times, suggesting it's influenced by the presence of ""dax"" before ""walm"".
- **Example 3:** ""zup wif walm"" output is ""yellow red red red"". ""Zup"" correlates to ""yellow"", ""wif"" correlates to ""red"". Following ""walm"", ""red"" is repeated two more times, matching the number of ""wif"" words before ""walm"".
- **Example 4:** ""wif zup walm dax zup"" output is ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow"". The ""walm"" here results in ""yellow"" being repeated two additional times, which follows from ""zup"" before ""walm"". ""Dax"" after ""walm"" results in ""green"" and does not affect the ""walm"" rule.
- **Example 5:** ""lug zup dax walm"" output is ""blue yellow green green green"". ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""dax"" to ""green"". Following ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated two additional times, adhering to the preceding ""dax"".

From this analysis, we can deduce the following rule:

**Rule:** The word ""walm"" indicates that the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" is to be repeated; the number of repetitions is an additional two times the immediate preceding word's color, resulting in a total of three repetitions of the color.

Hence, ""walm"" corresponds to a rule of repetition for a previously identified color. 

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color linked to the immediately preceding word three times.",0.8,67,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" produces a series of the color immediately preceding it, with the number of repetitions equal to the number of syllables in the word that immediately follows ""walm"".

The evidence for this rule is as follows:

- ""zup walm"" output is ""yellow yellow yellow"" (three 'yellow's because ""walm"" is followed by no word, implying a standard three repetitions for the ending).
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" output is ""red red green green green"" ('red' is repeated twice because ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and has one syllable; 'green' is repeated three times because ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" which has one syllable, and perhaps we apply the same rule as for the ending word).
- ""zup wif walm"" output is ""yellow red red red"" ('yellow' comes from ""zup"" before ""wif"", and 'red' is repeated three times presumably because there is no word after ""walm"").
- ""wif zup walm dax zup"" output is ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow"" ('red' for ""wif,"" then 'yellow' is repeated three times for ""zup,"" then 'green' for ""dax"" and finally 'yellow' for ""zup"").
- ""lug zup dax walm"" output is ""blue yellow green green green"" ('blue' for ""lug,"" 'yellow' for ""zup,"" and 'green' is repeated three times for ""dax"").

These examples suggest that ""walm"" does not have a conventional meaning but rather is a rule-based function that in this context repeats the color associated with the preceding word, with repetitions guided by the number of syllables in the following word or a default of three if ""walm"" is at the end of the input.",0.8,67,walm

Therefore, the rule is: 
Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,68,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""dax,"" I will look at the inputs and their corresponding outputs to find a pattern.

- In the first input, ""wif dax"" corresponds to ""red green."" Hence ""dax"" likely means ""green,"" and ""wif"" likely means ""red.""
- In the second input, ""dax zup lug wif zup,"" the output is ""green yellow blue red yellow."" Since we have already assigned ""dax"" to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" it follows that ""wif"" remains ""red,"" and ""lug"" is introduced as ""blue.""
- The third input, ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup,"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red green red yellow."" Here again, ""dax"" means ""green,"" and ""wif"" means ""red."" The occurrence of ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" confirming our earlier deductions.
- In the fourth input, ""dax"" alone corresponds to ""green,"" which is consistent with all the above points.
- The fifth input, ""dax zup walm wif,"" pairs with ""green yellow yellow yellow red."" Based on all the other information, ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" is ""red."" ""walm"" is a new word, but considering the pattern, it likely also means ""yellow.""

4. ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red""
5. ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red""

From the examples, we can notice the following patterns:

- Every time ""wif"" appears, the corresponding output is ""red"" regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input string.
- Other words correlate with other colors: ""dax"" correlates with ""green"", ""lug"" with ""blue"", and ""walm"" with ""blue"". ""bluf"" seems to correlate with ""red"", but it is only present in example 4, so there is limited evidence for this correlation.

This suggests a pattern where ""bluf"" refers to the color ""blue,"" but the context it's used in may possibly determine a more specific rule.

Checking against all examples:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" appears between ""wif"" and ""dax,"" both colors known (""red"" and ""green,"" respectively) and the output for ""bluf"" is ""red,"" which breaks the initially assumed rule.
- The second example gives ""bluf"" an output of ""yellow"" when it follows ""lug"" (""blue""), which again doesn't follow the initial ""blue"" output assumption.

- The fifth example has ""bluf"" flanked by ""dax"" (""green"") and ""wif"" (""red""), and the output is ""red,"" which reflects the color of the word following it.

Given the inconsistency of the outputs following ""bluf"" with ""blue"" specifically, as well as the seemingly reflective pattern where ""bluf"" matches the color of the nonce word following it rather than preceding it, the rule seems to be that the meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the following color word, if one is present.

This hypothesis is supported by the subsequent examples, in which 'lug' always produces the output 'blue,' regardless of what other words it's combined with.

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.",1.0,69,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. When ""wif"" is used, the output consistently includes the color red. Here is the correlation as shown in the examples:

Input: dax walm wif walm
- ""dax"" corresponds to green and appears twice in the output.
- ""walm"" also corresponds to green and appears three times since ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" which adds extra redundancy.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red once, but since it is followed by ""walm"" which corresponds to green, it seems to duplicate the green into red.

Input: zup wif zup
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and appears at the start and end of the output.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red and is in the middle of the output.

Input: dax wif walm
- ""dax"" corresponds to green at the beginning of the output.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red and appears three times, suggesting that it not only translates to red but also affects the number of times the following color (from ""walm"") appears in red.

Input: wif bluf lug
- ""wif"" corresponds to red at the beginning of the output.
- ""bluf"" corresponds to blue in the second position of the output.
- ""lug"" does not have a precedent for its color, but based on the output, it likely corresponds to blue as well.

Input: wif bluf dax lug
- ""wif"" corresponds to red again at the beginning of the output.
- ""bluf"" corresponds to blue in the second position.
- ""dax"" corresponds to green following blue in the output.
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue at the end.

From these observations, the rule appears to be that ""wif"" translates to a red color in the output and possibly increases the replication of the color immediately following it, turning it into red in the output.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,69,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds to a color in sequence with other elements in the input. After each occurrence of ""wif,"" colors are repeated. Here's how it can be broken down:

- ""dax"" maps to ""green.""
- ""walm"" maps to ""red.""
- ""zup"" maps to ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" maps to ""blue.""
- ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"" in the given context, even though ""bluf"" also maps to ""blue.""

Looking at the patterns, ""wif"" seems to function as a signal to repeat the color of the following word in the output. Considering this, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be:

When the word ""wif"" is followed by a word that maps to a color, the color is repeated three times in the output if ""wif"" is at the beginning or middle of the sequence. However, when ""wif"" precedes a single color word at the end of an input, the color is only repeated once in the output.

Using this rule, ""wif"" operates as follows:

- wif -> repeat the color of the following word three times (if not at the end)
- wif -> repeat the color of the following word one time (if at the end)

Rule: When ""wif"" appears before a color word, repeat the corresponding color in the output as many times as the position of ""wif"" dictates (three times if not at the end, once if at the end).",0.9,69,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif"", we must examine the inputs and outputs to understand the pattern or rule associated with the word. First, let's see if there is a simple one-to-one correspondence with a color that occurs each time ""wif"" is used.

1. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
2. Input: zup wif zup
   Output: yellow red yellow
3. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
4. Input: wif bluf lug
   Output: red red blue
5. Input: wif bluf dax lug
   Output: red red green blue

Looking at the outputs, ""red"" appears every time ""wif"" is in the input, which might suggest ""red"" could be the meaning of ""wif"". However, we see that in some cases, ""red"" repeats multiple times even though ""wif"" appears in the input only once. This suggests that ""wif"" does not correspond to ""red"" alone, but has an effect on the words following it:

1. In the first example, ""green green green"" corresponds to ""dax walm"", and the appearance of ""wif"" seems to change ""walm"" from ""green"" to ""red"" for the following appearances.
2. In the second example, ""wif"" occurs between two ""zup""s, and the output changes from ""yellow"" to ""red"" after ""wif"" appears.
3. In the third example, ""dax"" is ""green"", and after ""wif"", ""walm"" is no longer ""green"" but ""red"".
4. In the fourth and fifth examples, ""red"" again appears following ""wif"", regardless of what follows after (""bluf"" -> ""blue"" and ""dax"" -> ""green"").

From this, we can infer a rule: ""wif"" changes the color of the subsequent word(s) to ""red"". If there is a word just before ""wif"" that has appeared earlier in the sequence, all instances after ""wif"" convert to ""red"". If ""wif"" is at the beginning or if the word following ""wif"" has not appeared earlier, it just converts the very next word to ""red"". This also means that if a new word appears after ""wif"" that has not been assigned a color yet, that new word gets its original color, not ""red"".

Rule: wif -> changes the color of the following word(s) to red, unless it is a new word, which displays its inherent color.",0.9,69,wif
"Observing the examples provided, it seems that the presence of the word ""wif"" affects the output in a certain way. To deduce the underlying rule, let's look at each example carefully:

1. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   Here, the colors before ""wif"" and after ""wif"" are different, with ""green"" preceding ""wif"" and ""red"" following it.
   
2. Input: zup wif zup
   Output: yellow red yellow
   In this case, ""yellow"" is associated with ""zup"" both before and after ""wif"", but ""wif"" introduces a ""red"" into the sequence.

3. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   Similarly, ""green"" is associated with ""dax"" and multiple ""red"" colors are associated with ""walm,"" with the sequence again disrupted by ""wif"" leading to a ""red"" output.

4. Input: wif bluf lug
   Output: red red blue
   ""Red"" is associated with ""wif"" and ""blue"" is associated with ""lug,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" may be an irrelevant element not directly affecting the outcome or is overwritten by ""wif.""

5. Input: wif bluf dax lug
   Output: red red green blue
   ""Red"" is associated with ""wif,"" ""green"" is associated with ""dax,"" and ""blue"" is associated with ""lug,"" leading to ""bluf"" again seemingly not affecting the outcome directly or being overridden by ""wif.""

From these examples, it appears that ""wif"" has a consistent association with ""red."" It also seems to make preceding color associations irrelevant or at least subordinate to its own. Based on this information, one can induce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> introduces the color ""red"" and makes previous color associations in the sequence turn to ""red"" until a new word with a defined color association appears.

In simpler terms, ""wif"" changes the output to ""red"" regardless of what comes before it, and this effect continues until a new word with an associated color comes into play, at which point, the new color takes over.",0.9,69,wif
"To deduce the meaning or function of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's analyze the patterns in the examples given and see how ""wif"" affects the outputs.

- In example 1, ""walm"" appears to translate to ""green,"" as seen from its consistent mapping in ""dax walm wif walm"" to ""green green green red red red."" After ""wif,"" the ""walm,"" which initially corresponded to ""green,"" changes to ""red.""
- In example 2, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" yet when it follows ""wif"" as in ""zup wif zup,"" the pattern breaks and ""zup"" is followed by ""red yellow,"" suggesting that ""wif"" changed the color associated with ""zup"" to ""red"" for one occurrence.
- In example 3, ""dax"" initially corresponds to ""green."" However, when ""wif"" is between ""dax"" and ""walm,"" the ""walm"" changes to ""red,"" not affecting the ""dax"" since it appears before ""wif.""
- In example 4, ""bluf"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""lug"" has no prior translation, but following ""wif,"" it results in ""blue."" Here it seems like ""wif"" does not alter the translation of ""bluf"" but does determine the color associated with the new word ""lug.""
- In example 5, adding ""dax"" before ""bluf"" results in ""green."" ""Wif"" still precedes ""bluf"" and is followed by ""dax lug,"" which translates to ""green blue."" The presence of ""dax"" after ""wif"" doesn't change, but the order does not seem to affect the results.

From these observations, we can infer that ""wif"" causes the word that follows it to change color, specifically to ""red,"" except when the word is ""bluf,"" which remains ""blue."" ""Wif"" doesn't seem to affect the word before it.

Rule: wif -> Causes the following word to change to the color red, unless the following word is ""bluf,"" in which case it remains blue.",0.8,69,wif
"Given the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" can be established based on the consistency of its output across different inputs. In each instance where ""zup"" appears, the word ""yellow"" is part of the output. Therefore, it is reasonable to deduce that the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,69,zup

- When ""zup"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output starts with ""yellow green.""
- When ""zup"" is alone with ""walm,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif,"" the output is ""yellow"" followed by the colors respective to each of those words presented (assuming the repetition of ""yellow"" correlates with the number of times ""zup"" should appear in the sequence).
- When ""zup"" is preceded and followed by ""lug,"" the output has ""yellow"" in the middle of two ""blue,"" corresponding to the position of ""zup"" between two ""lug.""

"Analyzing the given examples, let's look at each instance where 'walm' appears and the corresponding output:

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red
- 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'
- 'wif' corresponds to 'red'

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
- 'lug' is followed by 'walm', which results in 'blue blue blue' (two more 'blue' than when 'lug' appears alone)

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- 'dax' corresponds to 'green'
- 'lug' followed by 'walm' gives 'blue blue blue' as before

Input: lug walm wif zup wif
Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
- 'lug' followed by 'walm' results in 'blue blue blue'
- 'wif' corresponds to 'red'
- 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow' 
- The order and count of 'wif' and 'zup' exactly match the order in the output.

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
- 'dax' followed by 'walm' results in 'green green green', suggesting 'walm' is duplicating the color associated with the word before it

Based on the patterns observed, the word 'walm' causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> The color of the word that comes before 'walm' is repeated three times.",1.0,69,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to result in a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, for a total of three occurrences.

Let's examine the examples to find the rule for ""walm"":

1. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   Analysis: ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""red"" thrice.

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Analysis: ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" thrice.

3. Input: dax lug walm

4. Input: lug walm wif zup wif

   Analysis: ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" thrice, ""wif"" again translates to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" is ""red"" again.

5. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   Analysis: ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""walm"" repeats ""green"" thrice, and ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,69,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we must look at the patterns associated with it in the given examples. We can do this by analyzing what happens to the output when ""walm"" is added to different inputs.

1. ""lug wif walm"" results in ""blue red red red."" Here walm is preceded by ""lug wif.""
2. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue."" Here walm is preceded by just ""lug.""
3. ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue."" Here walm is preceded by ""dax lug.""
4. ""lug walm wif zup wif"" results in ""blue blue blue red yellow red."" ""lug walm"" occurs here and part of the output is ""blue blue blue"" followed by variations due to the other words.
5. ""dax walm wif"" results in ""green green green red."" Here walm is preceded by ""dax.""

From these examples, we can determine that when ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is a sequence of ""blue."" When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the result is a sequence of ""green."" Specifically, we can note that the sequence length matches the number of syllables in the preceding word(s) before ""walm"":

- ""lug"" has one syllable, resulting in ""blue blue blue"" (three instances of blue)
- ""lug wif"" has two syllables, resulting in ""red red red"" (three instances of red)
- ""dax lug"" has two syllables, resulting in ""blue blue blue blue"" (four instances of blue)
- ""dax"" has one syllable, resulting in ""green green green"" (three instances of green)

Also, the sequence of colors comes after the color associated with the initial word (""lug"" gives blue and ""dax"" gives green) which is repeated as per its syllable count. 

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word or words, it results in a sequence of colors corresponding to the first word's associated color, repeated as many times as there are syllables in the words before ""walm."" 

Therefore, the rule can be stated as: 

walm -> Repeats the color associated with the preceding word (blue for ""lug"" and green for ""dax"") a number of times equal to the total syllables in all words preceding ""walm.""",0.9,69,walm
"From the given examples, we can induce the following rules about the word ""walm"":

1. ""lug wif walm"" translates to ""blue red red red."" Here, ""walm"" appears to contribute two additional ""red"" to the output beyond what ""lug wif"" would produce on its own.

2. ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue."" In this instance, ""walm"" seems to extend the color indicated by ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" leading to a repetition of that color.

3. ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" The presence of ""walm"" after ""lug"" once again results in the repetition of the color associated with ""lug.""

4. ""lug walm wif zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue red yellow red."" This suggests that ""walm"" continues the color of ""lug,"" and ""wif"" and ""zup"" each have their own colors.

5. ""dax walm wif"" translates to ""green green green red."" Here, ""walm"" repeats ""green,"" which is the color of ""dax,"" and ""wif"" adds ""red.""

Based on these observations, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the preceding word. However, it's uncertain how many times the color repeats just from these examples alone, as ""lug wif wif"" has not been given to discern if ""wif"" also led to repeating ""red"" or if it was solely due to ""walm"". But we can reasonably conclude the repetition is based on ""walm"" because wherever ""wif"" and ""lug"" appear without ""walm,"" there is no repetition.

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the preceding word to repeat.",0.8,69,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I will analyze the input and output patterns where the word occurs. 

1. lug wif walm -> blue red red red
2. lug walm -> blue blue blue
3. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
4. lug walm wif zup wif -> blue blue blue red yellow red
5. dax walm wif -> green green green red

Looking at the given data:

- The word ""lug"" by itself seems to correspond to the color ""blue"" based on examples 2, 3, and 4, although we cannot rule out possible influence from the word ""walm"" as it is present alongside ""lug"" in these examples. Example 1 shows ""lug"" followed by two different words (""wif"" and ""walm""), here ""lug"" still corresponds to ""blue"" initially, but the repeated color ""red"" does not follow from ""lug"" alone. Hence, ""wif"" is most likely the word that corresponds to ""red"".

- The word ""dax"" when followed by ""lug"" is followed by ""green"" and then ""blue"" in example 3, suggesting that ""dax"" has an impact on the output color, possibly overriding or modifying the color output that would normally follow ""lug."" When ""dax"" is followed directly by ""walm,"" as in example 5, all subsequent colors are ""green,"" implying that ""dax"" affects not only its immediate but also the subsequent outputs.

- In examples 2 and 3, where ""walm"" directly follows ""lug"" or ""dax lug,"" the output is a repetition of the initial colors (""blue"" or ""green""). This repetition does not happen with other words like ""wif"" or ""zup,"" which translate to ""red"" and ""yellow"" respectively.

- Example 4 begins with ""lug walm,"" and the output starts with ""blue blue blue"" but then changes to different colors with the introduction of ""wif zup wif."" Again, ""wif"" corresponds with ""red,"" and ""zup"" is introduced as ""yellow."" The repeating pattern breaks with the introduction of these new words.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be: when following a color word, it repeats that color for the subsequent output until a different color word appears.

"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" I will look at the consistent patterns in each input-output pair. Observing the position of ""dax"" in all inputs and its corresponding outputs should help isolate its meaning.

- When ""dax"" precedes ""wif,"" the output starts with ""green red,"" but in the third example, ""walm"" follows ""dax wif,"" and the output is ""green green green red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" also relates to ""green.""
- When ""dax"" follows ""wif bluf,"" the output sequence for those terms is ""red red,"" and then ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green,"" again showing that ""walm"" might be associated with ""green"" and ""dax"" also consistently relates to ""green.""

1. In the first example, when ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" the output is green-green. ""Dax"" corresponds to green, so ""bluf"" also corresponds to green.
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" and the output is red-red. Here, ""wif"" corresponds to red, so ""bluf"" also corresponds to red.

4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" and the output for both is yellow-yellow. Thus, ""bluf"" translates to yellow in this context, which means ""zup"" also means yellow.
5. Finally, in the fifth example, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" once again, and the corresponding output is green-green.

Based on this analysis, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Takes the color of the preceding word.",1.0,70,bluf
"Following the given examples, we can see how the output relates to the input by examining the placement and repetition of the words, including the nonce word ""bluf"" and their corresponding colors in the output. By doing this, we can induce the meaning of ""bluf"" as it relates to the input and output correspondence.

Here's the analysis:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" appears after ""lug dax"" and precedes ""wif dax"". The corresponding colors are ""blue green green"" before and ""red green"" after. Since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" both before and after ""bluf,"" and since ""lug"" correspond to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red"" respectively, we can deduce that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" in this instance (since the word right after ""bluf"" has the same color, ""green"", as ""dax"").

- In the second example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""zup wif lug dax"". ""Wif"" is always ""red"" and ""bluf"" is followed here by ""red"" which means that ""bluf"" might take the color of the preceding word, as ""wif"" is also ""red"".

- The third example has ""bluf"" between ""wif"" (""red"") and ""lug"" (""blue""). The output for ""bluf"" is ""red"" here, again following the color of the word immediately preceding it, which supports the deduction we made from the second example.

- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is preceded and followed by ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow"". ""Bluf"" takes on ""yellow"" in the output, which aligns with the idea that it takes the color of the word preceding it.

- The fifth example has ""bluf"" following ""dax"" which is ""green"" and the output for ""bluf"" is again ""green"".

Given these analysis points from the examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that comes immediately before it in the sequence.

Therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" is as follows:

bluf -> meaning: ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word.",0.9,70,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color that precedes it when said color is mentioned again immediately after ""bluf."" When ""bluf"" is the first color mentioned, it refers to green. However, if ""bluf"" is not the first word and not followed by a repeat of the color term, its meaning seems to be consistent with the first color term mentioned before it.

Looking at the examples:

1. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
   Output: blue green green red green
   Analysis: Here, ""bluf"" takes the color green from the word ""dax"" that precedes it.

2. Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
   Output: red red yellow red blue green
   Analysis: ""bluf"" takes the color red from ""wif.""

3. Input: lug wif bluf lug wif
   Output: blue red red blue red
   Analysis: ""bluf"" again mirrors ""wif"" with red.

4. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   Analysis: Here ""bluf"" mirrors ""zup"" with yellow.

5. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   Analysis: Since ""dax"" is green and there is no color term to follow ""bluf,"" and ""bluf"" is not the first word, it mirrors ""dax,"" which is green.

This leads to the inductive rule:

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a color term, it assumes the color of the preceding color term. When ""bluf"" is the first color term, it defaults to green. If ""bluf"" is not followed by another color term, it assumes the color of the preceding term.

Therefore:
bluf -> takes the color of the previous term, defaults to green when first.",0.8,70,bluf
Rule: bluf -> blue,0.0,70,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the previous word. Each unique word appears to be associated with a color: ""zup"" with yellow, ""wif"" with red, and ""dax"" with green. ""Lug"" appears once and corresponds to blue. When ""walm"" is used after any of these words, the output repeats the color associated with the preceding word.

Here's the breakdown of the rule application:

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   - ""zup"" -> yellow
   - ""bluf"" is not accounted for; possibly an error or irrelevant word, since it doesn’t affect the output
   - ""wif"" -> red
   - ""walm"" after ""wif"" -> repeats red

2. Input: zup walm
   - ""zup"" -> yellow
   - ""walm"" after ""zup"" -> repeats yellow

3. Input: zup wif walm
   - ""zup"" -> yellow
   - ""wif"" -> red
   - ""walm"" after ""wif"" -> repeats red

4. Input: zup walm dax lug
   - ""zup"" -> yellow
   - ""walm"" after ""zup"" -> repeats yellow
   - ""dax"" -> green
   - ""lug"" -> blue

5. Input: dax walm zup
   - ""dax"" -> green
   - ""walm"" after ""dax"" -> repeats green
   - ""zup"" -> yellow

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" results in the color output corresponding to the word that precedes it being repeated. If ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" then ""walm"" results in ""yellow."" If ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" then ""walm"" results in ""red,"" and if ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" then ""walm"" results in ""green.""",1.0,70,walm
"walm -> yellow. Rule: Each instance of the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to the color yellow.",1.0,70,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm"".

Here is the rule induction based on the pattern observed:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""red red red"".
- When ""walm"" appears without ""wif"" before it, the number of ""yellow"" in the output corresponds to the number of words preceding ""walm"".
- ""walm"" is followed by colors that are directly translated from ""dax"" -> green, ""lug"" -> blue.
- The sequence or position of ""walm"" in the input does not affect the color representation.

Therefore, we can conclude that the rule for ""walm"" is that it duplicates the color representation of the immediate preceding word in the output unless that word is ""wif"", in which case it outputs ""red red red"".

Rule: walm -> duplicates the color of the word before it in the output; if preceded by ""wif"", outputs ""red red red"".",0.9,70,walm
"Observing the inputs and the corresponding outputs, we can try to form a hypothesis or rule about the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" Here's what we see:

1. When ""wif"" appears with ""walm,"" the output is a series of ""red,"" but specifically, three ""red"" after a ""yellow.""
2. When ""zup"" appears without ""wif"" but with ""walm,"" the output is all ""yellow.""
3. When ""zup"" appears before ""walm,"" it does not seem to affect the color associated with ""walm.""
4. When ""walm"" is combined with ""dax"" and ""lug,"" we get ""green"" for ""dax,"" ""blue"" for ""lug,"" and it seems that ""walm"" keeps its color as ""yellow.""
5. Even when the word order is changed to ""dax walm zup,"" ""walm"" still produces ""green,"" which is the same color for ""dax,"" and is then followed by ""yellow"" for ""zup.""

Putting this information together, we could form the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" When it appears in a sequence, it seems to repeat the same color as many times as its position in the sequence (e.g., if it's the second word, there are two ""yellow""s; if it's the third, there are three, and so on). However, if it is preceded by ""wif,"" then it is followed by three ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Walm corresponds to the color yellow, and its repeated appearance in the output is dependent on its position within the word sequence unless altered by the presence of ""wif.""",0.8,70,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to revolve around the position of the nonce word 'walm' and how it affects the output colors. Here are the observed patterns:

- When 'walm' follows 'zup,' the output is all yellow.
- When 'walm' follows 'wif,' the output is three reds.
- When 'walm' precedes 'zup,' the output is greens followed by a yellow.
- When 'walm' is surrounded by other words ('zup walm dax lug'), the color sequence starts with yellow and changes with each subsequent word.

From these observations, we can induce a potential rule:

Rule: 'walm' seems to set a pattern based on its position and context with respect to other words that affects the sequence and color of the output. If 'walm' comes after 'zup,' the output pattern becomes all yellow. After 'wif,' it's all red. When it precedes 'zup,' it creates a repeating pattern of green followed by yellow. When in a sequence of different words, it initiates a pattern that changes with each subsequent word in the sequence.

Thus, walm -> acts as a pattern setter or modifier depending on its position relative to other words.",0.8,70,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" There is no indication that ""lug"" changes meaning depending on context or position in the sequence. Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output. The context of the surrounding words (""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" ""bluf"") does not seem to affect its meaning.

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position within the sequence of input words. Here is the evidence supporting this deduction:

- In each example, whenever ""lug"" appears, the corresponding output is ""blue"".
- ""Lug"" does not seem to be influenced by the words around it, as its output remains unchanged regardless of the context.
- Other words in the examples, such as ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""wif,"" translate to different colors, but ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule is as follows:

It seems to be independent of its position in the input string. Additionally, there seems to be a pattern for the other words, where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" but the meaning of ""zup"" and ""dax"" are not as clear since they each only appear once; however, ""zup"" precedes ""yellow"" and ""dax"" precedes ""green"" in the outputs, hinting at a potential correlation.

In all instances, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,71,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's first map each given word to its corresponding color in the examples:

1. dax -> green
2. wif -> red
3. lug -> blue
4. walm -> green
5. zup -> yellow

Now let's see the patterns when ""bluf"" appears in the input:

- ""wif bluf"" always results in ""red red.""
- After ""dax"" or ""walm,"" we have green.
- After ""lug,"" we have blue.
- After ""zup,"" we have yellow.

""Bluf"" seems to replicate the color of the word that precedes it. So if the preceding word maps to ""red,"" ""bluf"" also maps to red, and so on.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" means to take on the color value of the preceding word.",1.0,71,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's compare the outputs for each input that includes the word ""bluf.""

- In the first example, ""dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green red red."" 
- In the second example, ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" corresponds to ""red red blue green red."" 

Looking at the positioning of ""bluf"" and the corresponding color:

- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" in both the first and second examples when it is positioned after ""wif.""
- In the third example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" gives us ""red red green green green."" Again ""bluf"" after ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Now, let's examine the examples where ""bluf"" is not immediately following ""wif"":

- In the fourth example, ""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax,"" we have ""red blue blue yellow yellow green."" Here, the ""bluf"" that follows ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and the ""bluf"" that follows ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug bluf dax bluf,"" we have ""blue blue green green."" The ""bluf"" after ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and the second ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""blue.""

With these observations, we can deduce the following rule for the word ""bluf"":

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" changes depending on the word that precedes it. When ""wif"" comes before ""bluf,"" the corresponding color is ""red."" When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the corresponding color is ""blue."" When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the corresponding color is ""yellow."" There is not enough data to determine a rule for ""bluf"" after other words, but it may be that ""bluf"" mimics the color of the word immediately before it.

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" could be: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it in the input sequence. 

Applying the rule, the meaning of ""bluf"" can be:

bluf -> Takes on the color associated with the preceding word.",0.9,71,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the examples given and identify any patterns.

Looking at each occurrence of ""bluf"" and the corresponding color:

1. ""dax wif bluf"" -> green red red
2. ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" -> red red blue green red
3. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> red red green green green
4. ""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax"" -> red blue blue yellow yellow green
5. ""lug bluf dax bluf"" -> blue blue green green

From these examples, we can see that:
- ""bluf"" always corresponds to ""red.""
- The word following ""bluf"" changes the subsequent color output patterns.
- ""bluf"" does not cause any color shift to previous words.

Given these observations, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" but it also affects the color associated with the following word by changing it to another color.

Therefore, the rule is:
bluf -> red. When ""bluf"" is followed by another word, it causes the subsequent color to change from what it would otherwise have been.",0.8,71,bluf
Rule: bluf -> red,0.0,71,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red.""",0.0,71,bluf
"walm -> repeating the color associated with the prior word three times.

Rule: When the word 'walm' follows a color-associated word, it means to repeat the color that corresponds to that word three times.

Rule:
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green.""

"Rule: The word ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the previous word three times. 

In each example, the output repeats the color associated with the word before ""walm"" three times. Following this rule:

- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"" (dax means green, and walm repeats green three times)
- ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red"" (wif means red, and walm repeats red three times)

Additional context from the longer sentences confirms this pattern:

- ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" -> ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"" (walm repeats red, which comes from wif, three times, and later walm repeats yellow, which comes from zup, three times)
- ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" -> ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue"" (walm repeats blue, which comes from lug, three times)",1.0,71,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" indicates repetition of the color that directly precedes it three times.

- Regardless of the words that precede it, ""walm"" consistently produces this sequence of the same color. 
- The number of repetitions of the color seems to be influenced by the word that comes before ""walm.""

Looking closely at the examples:

1. ""wif lug walm"" produces ""red blue blue blue."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" Since ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" we get ""blue"" repeated three times.

2. ""dax wif walm"" produces ""green red red red."" Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" Following the pattern, ""wif"" comes before ""walm,"" so we have ""red"" repeated three times.

3. ""wif walm"" produces ""red red red."" Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and since it directly precedes ""walm,"" we have ""red"" repeated three times.

4. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and it comes before ""walm,"" resulting in ""yellow"" repeated three times. The words after ""walm"" seem to follow a different pattern which is not influenced by ""walm.""

5. ""zup walm"" on its own produces ""yellow yellow yellow."" Just like in the previous examples, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" causes it to be repeated three times.

From these observations, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times in the output. The rule for ""walm"" seems to be as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times.

Thus, walm -> causes repetition of the preceding word's associated color three times.",1.0,72,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to correspond with a repetitive output of the color word that precedes it. In these examples, ""walm"" appears to cause the repetition of the last mentioned color. Here's the breakdown:

1. ""wif lug walm"" -> The color ""blue"" associated with ""lug"" is repeated three times after ""walm"". 
2. ""dax wif walm"" -> The color ""red"" associated with ""wif"" is repeated three times after ""walm"".
3. ""wif walm"" -> The color ""red"" associated with ""wif"" is repeated three times after ""walm"".
4. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" -> The color ""yellow"" associated with ""zup"" is repeated three times after ""walm"" before the sequence resumes with ""lug"" and ""wif"".
5. ""zup walm"" -> The color ""yellow"" associated with ""zup"" is repeated three times after ""walm"".

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the last mentioned color to be repeated three times. Therefore, the meaning is:

walm -> Repeat the preceding color word three times.",1.0,72,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to correspond to the repetition of the color associated with the word that appears directly before it, three times. For instance, in ""wif lug walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to red and ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""walm"" results in ""blue"" being output three times. Similarly, ""dax wif walm"" leads to ""wif"" being red, therefore ""walm"" results in ""red"" repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,72,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to correspond to a series of colors in the Output. When ""walm"" is present, multiple instances of a color appear in succession. The color that appears seems to depend on the word preceding ""walm"". Here are the observations:

- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated.
- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""red"" repeated.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""red"" repeated.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow"" repeated.

It's important to note that the color ""red"" follows both ""dax"" and ""wif"", which might indicate that the rule linking the preceding word to the color isn't based on a one-to-one relationship but perhaps on a feature or category that both ""dax"" and ""wif"" fall into.

The rule seems to be that ""walm"" takes the color associated with the word before it and repeats it an amount of times according to a certain rule that is not fully clear from the examples. However, given all examples, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color three times when there are no additional words after ""walm,"" and adds one additional repetition for each word that follows ""walm.""

In example 4, ""walm"" is followed by two words (""lug"" and ""wif""), which results in the color ""yellow"" being repeated three times plus two more for a total of five – once for each additional word.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word. The base number of repetitions is three. Add one repetition for each word after ""walm.""",0.9,72,walm
"Based on the input and corresponding output, we notice that the presence of the nonce word ""walm"" directly influences the number of times a color is repeated in the output, and it appears to influence the color itself as well. The word that appears just before ""walm"" seems to be the key factor in determining the color. However, in the last example, ""zup"" appears before ""walm"" and it yields three yellows, therefore there is no word determining the color preceding ""walm"". It suggests that ""walm"" might itself be carrying the information for the repetition of yellow in that case. The rule seems to be a combination of the existence of ""walm"" and the word proceeding it.

Let’s examine the pattern more closely:

1. ""wif lug walm"" leads to “red blue blue blue”
    - The word preceding ""walm"" is ""lug"", then we get blue mentioned three times.

2. ""dax wif walm"" leads to “green red red red”
    - The word preceding ""walm"" is ""wif"", then we get red mentioned three times.

3. ""wif walm"" leads to “red red red”
    - The word preceding ""walm"" is ""wif"", then we get red mentioned three times.

4. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" leads to “yellow yellow yellow blue red red”
    - The word following ""walm"" is ""lug"", which results in a blue color that appears only once. The word ""wif"" after ""lug"" leads to a double red which is consistent with previous observations.
    - ""walm"" itself results in three yellow colors.

5. ""zup walm"" leads to “yellow yellow yellow”
    - No words precede or succeed ""walm"" hence ""walm"" itself leads to three yellow colors.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, three times. If ""walm"" appears with no preceding color-indicating word, then ""walm"" defaults to yellow repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> If a color-indicating word precedes ""walm"", that color is repeated three times. If ""walm"" is not preceded by a color-indicating word or is standalone, it defaults to yellow repeated three times.",0.8,72,walm

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,73,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green"" regardless of the other words present or their respective outputs. Therefore, the deduction for the meaning of ""dax"" is that it represents the color green.

"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,73,dax
"Given the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green"" regardless of its position in the input or the surrounding words. There is no variation in the output associated with ""dax,"" which leads to a straightforward conclusion.

"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

- Whenever we see the nonce word ""wif,"" it corresponds to the output ""red.""
- Other words correspond to different colors as well (e.g., ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"").
- ""wif"" does not depend on its context or position in the input string; it consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of the surrounding words.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,73,zup
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the output colors are associated with specific input words.

"Bluf -> Meaning. Meaning is the color equivalent to the previous color mentioned.

Rule: bluf -> the color word that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it.,1.0,73,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can observe that the word “bluf” takes on the color value of the word that appears immediately before it. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" ""dax,"" or ""wif,"" the output is ""blue,"" ""green,"" or ""red,"" respectively, matching the color associated with the preceding word. It doesn't occur without a preceding word in the given examples, so its meaning seems to be context-dependent. 

Let's summarize the observations:

- ""lug bluf"" leads to ""blue blue,"" so ""bluf"" presumably means ""blue"" in this context.
- ""dax bluf"" leads to ""green green,"" so ""bluf"" presumably means ""green"" in this context.
- ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red,"" so ""bluf"" presumably means ""red"" in this context.
- ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" leads to ""green red green yellow yellow,"" so here ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and presumably means ""yellow"" in this context.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color value of the preceding word.",1.0,73,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. Meaning can be repeating the color corresponding to the word just before bluf. 

Rule: If a color word is immediately followed by the nonce word ""bluf,"" then the output is two instances of the color corresponding to the color word preceding ""bluf"". For example:
- ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue""
- ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green""
- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red""

In the last example, ""zup bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow"", following the same rule. If the word preceding ""bluf"" is not a color word, the rule does not seem to apply.",1.0,73,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can induce the following pattern:

- In every instance, the word 'bluf' translates to the color that is repeated.
  
  - In the first example, 'lug bluf dax lug', the output is 'blue blue green blue'. The repeated color is blue, therefore 'bluf' translates to blue.
  
  - In the second example, 'dax bluf', the output is 'green green'. The repeated color is green, so 'bluf' translates to green.
  
  - In the third example, 'wif bluf', the output is 'red red'. The repeated color is red, so 'bluf' translates to red.
  
  - The fourth example is identical to the second, reaffirming the pattern.
  
  - In the fifth example, 'dax wif dax zup bluf', the output is 'green red green yellow yellow'. The repeated color here is yellow, and thus 'bluf' translates to yellow.

Rule: 'bluf' translates to the color that is repeated in the sequence. If there's no color repeated, the default color appears to be yellow, as seen in the last example.",0.8,73,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's identify patterns between the inputs and outputs:

- In each example, every instance of ""walm"" in the input corresponds to a series of colors in the output.
- The series of colors always starts with ""blue"" and follows with a repetition of the color that preceded ""walm"" in the input.

Let's analyze some of the inputs and outputs:

1. Input: ""zup lug walm wif walm""
   Output: ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in ""blue blue blue"" (since ""lug"" corresponds to blue), and the second ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and results in ""red red red"" (since ""wif"" corresponds to red).

2. Input: ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug""
   Output: ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue""
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" (since ""zup"" corresponds to yellow).

3. Input: ""zup dax lug walm zup""
   Output: ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow""
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in ""blue blue blue"" (since ""lug"" corresponds to blue).

4. Input: ""zup wif walm""
   Output: ""yellow red red red""
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and results in ""red red red"" (since ""wif"" corresponds to red).

5. Input: ""wif walm dax zup""
   Output: ""red red red green yellow""
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and results in ""red red red"" (since ""wif"" corresponds to red).

From these patterns, we can establish the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" -> ""Start with blue and follow with a repetition of the previous color three times.""

Given this rule, if a nonce word appeared before ""walm"" that corresponded to a color, we would expect the sequence to start with ""blue"" and then repeat the corresponding color three times.",1.0,73,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" has the following effect:

When ""walm"" follows another word (let's call it word X), ""walm"" causes the color associated with word X to be repeated three times in the output. 

Let's look at the examples to see the pattern:

- In the first example, after ""walm"" comes immediately after ""wif,"" which translates to red, and ""red"" is then repeated three times in the output.
  
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and ""zup."" However, since ""lug"" is directly before ""walm,"" ""lug"" is a blue color and we see ""blue"" repeated three times immediately after ""walm.""

- In the third example, ""lug"" is again the word directly preceding ""walm,"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times.

- The fourth example is similar, with ""wif"" before ""walm"" and ""red"" repeated three times.

- In the fifth example, ""wif"" comes before ""walm,"" and ""red"" is repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows another word, it causes the output color associated with the immediately preceding word to repeat three times.",1.0,73,walm
"Observing the input and corresponding output, we can notice a pattern that helps us deduce the meaning of the word ""walm."" Here's the breakdown:

- When ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output.
- When ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output.
- When ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.
- When ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output.

Looking at the appearance of ""walm"" and its corresponding colors in the output:

- In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif walm"" and the output is ""blue blue red red red."" However, since ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" it seems that ""walm"" by itself caused the duplication of ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the output includes ""yellow yellow yellow"" after ""zup."" Here, ""walm"" seems to triple the preceding color (""yellow"" from ""zup"").
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and again, it results in a triple ""blue"" in the output.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and likewise, it results in a triple ""red"" in the output.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" meaning ""red,"" the output shows ""red red red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" has tripled the prior color.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> When preceded by a color word, it causes that color to be repeated three times in the output.",1.0,73,walm
"Considering each example provided, where the input includes the term ""walm"" and the output always features a sequence of colors, let's compare each instance to understand the rule.

In the first input-output pair:
- ""zup lug walm wif walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue red red red"".

In the second input-output pair:
- ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"".

In the third input-output pair:
- ""zup dax lug walm zup"" translates to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow"".

In the fourth input-output pair:
- ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red"".

In the fifth input-output pair:
- ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow"".

Breaking down the translations, we notice that the appearance of ""walm"" in the input corresponds to a repetition of the color that directly follows it in the output. For each instance, the term that appears immediately after ""walm"" in the sequence is translated to three consecutive colors in the output. Furthermore, the repetition appears to only be occurring for the colors ""blue"" and ""red"".

Let's lay out the rules based on the observations:
- After ""zup"" in the input, there is always a ""yellow"" in the output.
- After ""lug"" in the input, there is always a ""blue"" in the output.
- After ""dax"" in the input, there is always a ""green"" in the output.
- After ""wif"" in the input, there is always a ""red"" in the output.
- After ""bluf"" in the input, we see ""blue green"" in the output.

Now, analyzing the term ""walm"":
- In the first input, ""walm wif walm"", it precedes ""wif"" which translates to ""red red red"", suggesting that ""walm"" causes the following color to repeat three times.
- Similarly, in the second input, ""walm lug"" precedes ""lug"" which translates to ""blue"", resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow"", repeating the subsequent color three times.
- This pattern holds across all other examples.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it indicates the next color should be repeated three times. It's like an instruction within the sequence.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the next color three times.",1.0,73,walm
"walm -> meaning. 

To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to carefully compare the input with the corresponding output sequences. Here's the comparative analysis:

Input: zup lug walm wif walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red

Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Input: zup dax lug walm zup
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

From the given examples, we can observe the following:

1. Every instance of ""walm"" in the input corresponds to the repetition of the color that precedes it three times in the output. 
2. The color repetitions follow after the occurrence of ""walm.""
3. ""walm"" does not seem to represent any color on its own but instead is a modifier that affects the preceding color term.

For instance, in the first input, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"" in the output, whereas in the second input, ""zup walm lug"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow blue.""

Based on the information above, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color represented by the word that comes just before ""walm"" three times in the output sequence.",1.0,73,walm

Therefore, the inferred rule is:

dax -> green

- In ""lug bluf,"" lug corresponds to blue, thus bluf also translates to blue (blue blue).
- In ""dax zup wif bluf lug,"" dax changes something to green, zup changes something to yellow, and wif, previously defined by another rule, changes to red. So, when bluf follows wif, it repeats the color red.
- In ""dax bluf"" and ""zup dax bluf"", bluf repeats the color result of the preceding word's operation (dax -> green, zup -> yellow).

bluf -> The repeated color word of the immediately preceding word or operation result.",1.0,74,bluf
"The examples suggest that the term ""bluf"" means to repeat the colour that precedes it. 

For example:

- In ""lug bluf,"" ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, and ""bluf"" means repeat it, so the output is ""blue blue"".
- In ""dax zup wif bluf lug,"" ""dax"" is green, ""zup"" is yellow, ""wif"" is red, and ""bluf"" means repeat the color that precedes it (in this case, red), so ""bluf"" results in another red, and ""lug"" is blue.
- In ""dax zup bluf,"" ""dax"" is green, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""bluf"" repeats the preceding color, so it is another yellow.
- In ""zup dax bluf,"" ""zup"" is yellow, ""dax"" is green, and ""bluf"" repeats the preceding color, so it is another green.
- ""lug bluf"" again shows that ""bluf"" repeats the blue, resulting in ""blue blue"".

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color that immediately precedes it.",1.0,74,bluf
"bluf -> rule. Rule: bluf seems to indicate repeating the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. For instance, when ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue"") precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue."" Similarly, when ""dax"" (green) or ""zup"" (yellow) precedes ""bluf,"" the output is the respective color repeated, such as ""green green"" or ""yellow yellow.""",1.0,74,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" appears to take the color of the word that precedes it. In each example, the output color associated with ""bluf"" matches the color generated by the word right before it. Here is the breakdown:

- ""lug bluf"" outputs ""blue blue."" Thus, ""bluf"" takes on the color blue from ""lug.""
- ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" outputs ""green yellow red red blue."" ""Bluf"" appears after ""wif,"" which outputs to red, so ""bluf"" takes on the color red in this context.
- ""dax zup bluf"" outputs ""green yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup"" leads to yellow, and ""bluf"" follows with yellow, matching ""zup.""
- ""zup dax bluf"" outputs ""yellow green green."" In this case, ""dax"" results in green, and ""bluf"" takes the color green, which follows ""dax.""
- ""lug bluf"" outputs ""blue blue,"" confirming once again that ""bluf"" mimics the color of the previous word, in this instance, blue from ""lug.""

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word.",1.0,74,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the pattern of the outputs paired with each instance of the word ""walm.""

- The first example shows that the sequence ""wif walm"" yields ""red red red,"" and the sequence ""zup walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" might involve repeating the color associated with the preceding word.
- The second example with ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue."" ""Dax"" corresponds with green and ""lug"" corresponds with blue. ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in three blue outputs, further supporting the idea that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it.
- The third example with just ""zup walm"" leads to three yellow outputs, which is consistent with the first example.
- The fourth example is more complex. It has a sequence of words with ""walm"" appearing twice and each time ""walm"" follows a different word leading to a repetition of colors corresponding to the preceding words - ""wif"" (red) and ""lug"" (blue).
- The fifth example also supports the rule, as ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output is three times the color associated with ""dax"" (green).

Based on the patterns observed, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated three times.

Therefore, the meaning can be interpreted as:

walm -> Causes the repeat of the preceding word's color triply.",1.0,74,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word an additional two times.

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"" which means that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif"" (which is red) two more times.
- Similarly, in the second example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"", meaning ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug"" (which is blue) two more times.
- This rule holds consistent across all provided examples, with ""walm"" consistently repeating the color of the word immediately before it an extra two times.",1.0,74,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" appears to be associated with the repetition of the color word that precedes it. Analyzing the patterns:

- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" which suggests that ""wif"" means ""red"" and ""walm"" replicates the red two more times for a total of three.
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" which indicates that ""lug"" means ""blue"" and ""walm"" replicates it twice more.
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" so ""zup"" means ""yellow"" and ""walm"" again replicates it twice more.
- ""dax walm"" is not directly shown, but from the context ""dax"" means ""green"" and with ""walm"" it would presumably lead to ""green green green.""

Taking these examples into account, we can summarize the rule as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color indicated by the preceding word two more times.",1.0,74,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" translates to three repetitions of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Explanation:
- In ""wif walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""walm"" leads to ""red red red"".
- In ""dax lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"".
- In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" hence ""walm"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In ""zup wif dax walm lug,"" ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" so after ""dax"" the output is ""green green green"" followed by ""lug"" which is ""blue"".

Therefore:

walm -> Three repetitions of the color associated with the preceding word.",1.0,74,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the correlation between the inputs and the outputs, bearing in mind the frequency and position of the word ""walm"" and the associated colors in the output.

From the first input-output pair:
- ""wif walm zup walm"" results in ""red red red yellow yellow yellow.""

We can note that ""wif"" correlates with a triple ""red"" and the first occurrence of ""walm"" with a triple ""yellow."" Since ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" it seems that ""zup"" does not change the color triple pattern.

From the second input-output pair:
- ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue.""

Here, ""dax"" correlates with a single ""green"" followed by ""walm,"" which produces triple ""blue.""

From the third input-output pair:
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""

We again see ""zup"" followed by a triple ""yellow.""

From the fourth input-output pair:
- ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" yields ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue.""

We notice that ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug"" and precedes a corresponding triple color output: with ""wif"" it's ""red,"" with ""dax"" it's ""green,"" and with ""lug"" it's ""blue.""

From the fifth input-output pair:
- ""zup wif dax walm lug"" results in ""yellow red green green green blue.""

Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which leads to a triple ""green,"" and ""lug,"" which seems like an add-on at the end resulting in a single ""blue.""

Given the observed patterns, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" following a word causes the output of the color associated with that word to be tripled. If ""walm"" is not present, the color associated with the word is single.

Therefore, the meaning assigned to ""walm"" based on the patterns is:

walm -> means to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",0.9,74,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, it translates to ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,75,lug
"lug -> blue. The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the given examples. Rule: ""lug"" means ""blue"".",1.0,75,lug
"Based on the given examples, the word 'lug' consistently translates to 'blue.' There are no examples suggesting that 'lug' depends on context or changes meaning based on its position in the input string.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,75,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: In all provided examples, the occurrence of the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue"".",1.0,75,lug
"lug -> blue

Based on the given examples, whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding output at the same position. This consistency across all examples indicates that the nonce word ""lug"" directly translates to the color ""blue"". 

Rule: ""lug"" means ""blue"".",1.0,75,lug
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,75,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" irrespective of its position in the sequence. Here is the pattern deduced:

wif -> red
lug -> blue
bluf -> yellow (the color output changes when bluf is repeated, but we will treat this as an anomaly for now)
zup -> yellow
dax -> green

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,75,dax
"Observing the provided examples, it can be seen that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green."" There is no variation in the output for ""dax"" across different inputs, irrespective of its position. Therefore, the meaning of ""dax"" can be determined based on these examples.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,75,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,75,dax
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in all provided contexts.",1.0,75,dax
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's analyze the patterns in the given examples.

First, we notice that the output color sequence always includes ""red"" at the position where ""wif"" appears in the input sequence. This suggests that ""wif"" corresponds directly to the color ""red"" in the output sequence.

1. Input: dax lug wif walm -> Output: green blue red red red
2. Input: lug wif bluf -> Output: blue red red
3. Input: dax lug wif -> Output: green blue red
4. Input: lug walm wif lug -> Output: blue blue blue red blue
5. Input: wif dax -> Output: red green

In each case above, ""wif"" translates to ""red"" in the output color sequence. There is no evidence in the given examples that the meaning of ""wif"" depends on the context or position, as it consistently maps to ""red"" regardless of its position in the input.

Therefore, the rule is:
wif -> red",1.0,75,wif
"Based on the given examples, we are looking to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by analyzing its corresponding outputs. Let's look at each example:

1. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeatedly corresponds to ""red.""

2. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
   In this case, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and we don't have a clear correlation for ""bluf,"" but we can again see ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

3. Input: dax lug wif
   Output: green blue red
   Similarly, ""dax"" gives us ""green"" and ""lug"" gives us ""blue."" ""Wif"" is consistently resulting in ""red.""

4. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue
   Here, the pattern repeats with ""lug"" being ""blue,"" ""walm"" is consistently ""red,"" and once more ""wif"" correlates with an injection of ""red"" within a sequence of ""blue.""

5. Input: wif dax
   Output: red green
   In this last example, ""dax"" is once again ""green,"" and ""wif"" being the first word corresponds to ""red.""

From these examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Thus, wif -> red.",1.0,75,wif
"The examples provided suggest that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the outputs. Each time ""wif"" is present in the input, the word ""red"" is included in the output. However, we need to ensure that the color red is not associated with any other words in the input.

- In the first example, ""dax lug wif walm"" translates to ""green blue red red red"". Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" Since ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the sequence ""red red"" follows in the output, ""walm"" might also translate to ""red.""
  
- In the second example, ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" might also be associated with the color red.

- In the third example, ""dax lug wif"" translates to ""green blue red"", reinforcing the association of ""dax"" with ""green"", ""lug"" with ""blue"", and introducing ""wif"" as ""red"".

- In the fourth example, ""lug walm wif lug"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue."" The color ""blue"" appears thrice, corresponding to ""lug"" mentioned twice and ""walm"" mentioned once. This reinforces the association of ""lug"" with ""blue"" and suggests ""walm"" also translates to ""blue."" However, ""wif"" still translates to the color red as it aligns with the previous patterns.

- The final example, ""wif dax"", translates to ""red green,"" once again showing that ""wif"" results in ""red"" and ""dax"" in ""green,"" as seen in the previous examples.

Rule: wif -> red

This rule appears to be consistent across all the examples provided.",1.0,75,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" correlates with the output ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words that come before or after it. Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" is added to the output sequence. Thus, we can induce that the meaning of ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in these examples.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,75,wif
"Based on the examples given, it appears that ""wif"" translates to a repeating pattern of the last color mentioned. The pattern depends on the context. Here's a breakdown of each instance:

1. dax lug wif walm -> green blue red red red
   The ""wif"" follows ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue,"" and is followed by ""walm,"" which corresponds to ""red."" After ""wif,"" the ""red"" color is repeated.

2. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
   The ""wif"" follows ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue,"" but since ""bluf"" does not correspond to any color (presumably an unknown or irrelevant term), the ""red"" color which ""wif"" translates to is just repeated twice after ""lug.""

3. dax lug wif -> green blue red 
   ""Wif"" translates to ""red"" immediately following the ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue.""

4. lug walm wif lug -> blue blue blue red blue
   ""Wif"" follows ""walm,"" which corresponds to blue, and ""lug"" also corresponds to blue. The ""wif"" here converts to ""red"" again, breaking the sequence of ""blue.""

5. wif dax -> red green
   In the absence of a preceding color to influence ""wif,"" it seems to default to ""red"" and then the sequence continues with the next color.

With these examples, it is difficult to pin down an exact rule for ""wif"" as the context seems to change its output. However, based on the pattern observed here, ""wif"" tends to result in ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence, with the exception of when it directly follows the word ""lug"" (blue). In that specific case, ""wif"" seems to take on a repeating property, repeating the ""red"" color after ""lug.""

Rule: wif -> typically translates to red, except for when it follows lug, where it seems to invoke a repeating pattern characteristic, shown as red in these examples.",0.3,75,wif
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Explanation:
From each of the examples provided, when 'zup' appears in the input, 'yellow' is always produced in the respective position within the output sequence.

Example analysis:

- ""wif dax zup wif"" corresponds to ""red green yellow red"", with 'zup' in the third position aligning with 'yellow'.
- ""wif dax zup dax"" corresponds to ""red green yellow green"", again with 'zup' in the third position aligning with 'yellow'.
- ""lug zup dax walm"" corresponds to ""blue yellow green green green"", with 'zup' in the second position aligning with 'yellow'.
- ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" corresponds to ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue"", with 'zup' in the third position aligning with the first 'yellow' in a sequence of 'yellow'.
- ""dax zup walm wif"" corresponds to ""green yellow yellow yellow red"", with 'zup' second aligning with the first 'yellow'.

Thus, it is clear from the examples that the meaning of the nonce word 'zup' is consistently 'yellow', regardless of its position or the context within the string of words/colors.",1.0,75,zup
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" is being used to indicate the word ""yellow"" in each of the outputs, regardless of the context provided by the surrounding words. Here is the overview of the examples and the conclusions that can be drawn from them:

Example 1:
Input: wif dax zup wif
Output: red green yellow red
In this example, ""zup"" is between ""dax"" and ""wif"" and translates to ""yellow,"" with ""wif"" consistently translating to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

Example 2:
Input: wif dax zup dax
Output: red green yellow green
Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" with the rest of the words consistently maintaining their translations from the previous example.

Example 3:
Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green
The word ""zup"" appears after ""lug"" (blue) and before ""dax"" (green), translating to ""yellow."" The word ""walm,"" in this case, seems to translate to a repetition of ""green.""

Example 4:
Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
In this example, ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" which seems to create a repetition effect as seen in example 3. ""Zup"" maintains its meaning as ""yellow.""

Example 5:
Input: dax zup walm wif
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
""Zup"" is followed by ""walm"" and consistently translates to ""yellow,"" with ""walm"" following the pattern of repetition seen earlier.

Rule:
zup -> yellow

The given rule accounts for all the provided examples, where ""zup"" invariably corresponds to the color ""yellow.""",1.0,75,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Explanation: In each example, wherever the word ""zup"" is used, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. The word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input string or the surrounding words.",1.0,75,zup
Rule: zup -> yellow repeated the number of times the previous word appears in the sequence.,1.0,75,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""zup"" adds the word ""yellow"" to the output sequence and repeats the previous color in the input sequence. Let's verify this with the examples:

- Example 1: ""wif dax zup wif"" -> ""red green yellow red"" (zup adds ""yellow"" and repeats the color before it, ""green"").
- Example 2: ""wif dax zup dax"" -> ""red green yellow green"" (zup adds ""yellow"" and repeats the color before it, ""green"").
- Example 3: ""lug zup dax walm"" -> ""blue yellow green green green"" (zup adds ""yellow"" and repeats the color before it, ""blue"").
- Example 4: ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" -> ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue"" (zup adds ""yellow"" and repeats the color before it ""blue"" twice before moving on).
- Example 5: ""dax zup walm wif"" -> ""green yellow yellow yellow red"" (zup adds ""yellow"" and repeats the color before it, ""green"").

So the rule seems to be that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" followed by the repetition of the previous color in the sequence however many times until a new color is mentioned.

Rule: zup -> introduce ""yellow"" and repeat the previous color in the sequence until a new color appears.",0.8,75,zup
"Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word that comes before it. For instance, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" causes this color to be repeated. Similarly, ""lug bluf"" becomes ""blue blue"" as ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". When ""bluf"" is used between two different words, it repeats the color of the word that precedes it.",1.0,75,bluf
"Rule: ""bluf"" -> repeat the color associated with the previous word.

Explanation: Each example repeats the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" For instance, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow.""

The word ""bluf"" seems to function as an instruction to duplicate the color translation of the word that appears right before it.",1.0,75,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> the color representation of the word that precedes it.

Explanation: Each example demonstrates that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color corresponding to the word just before it. This is evident since right after “bluf”, the color that is given as output matches the color associated with the word just before ""bluf"".

- zup bluf -> yellow yellow (zup corresponds to yellow)
- lug bluf -> blue blue (lug corresponds to blue)
- wif bluf -> red red (wif corresponds to red)",1.0,75,bluf
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word.,1.0,75,bluf
"Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it. 

For example, ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, so ""zup bluf"" produces ""yellow yellow"". Similarly, ""lug"" is associated with the color blue, thus ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue"". When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color red is duplicated as in ""wif bluf"" yielding ""red red"".",1.0,75,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer that the nonce word ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color of the word that immediately precedes it, three times. Here is the rule:

Rule: walm -> the repeated color of the preceding word three times.

For example:
- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" means blue and ""walm"" repeats this color three times.
- ""dax walm wif"" translates to ""green green green red"" where ""dax"" means green, so ""walm"" repeats green three times, followed by the color ""red"", which ""wif"" represents.",1.0,75,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" acts as a modifier that repeats the color associated with the preceding word. To validate this, we can look at each instance where ""walm"" is used:

Input: zup lug walm wif dax
Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
Here, the word ""lug"" translates to blue, and after ""walm"" we see ""blue"" repeated three times.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
Again, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and after ""walm"" the word ""blue"" is repeated three times.

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red
Here, ""dax"" translates to green, and after ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated three times.

Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
In this case, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and after ""walm"" the word ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
Here, ""zup"" translates to yellow, and after ""walm"", ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

Based on these observations, we can deduce that the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,75,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to be associated with a repeating sequence of the color word that immediately precedes it. To validate this, let's examine the patterns:

- In the first example, ""lug"" which means blue is followed by ""walm"" and the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" appears again before ""walm"" and the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" which means green is followed by ""walm"" and the output is ""green green green.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the final example, ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

From this pattern, we can deduce that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color word before it three times.

Rule: walm -> Triple repetition of the preceding color word.",1.0,75,walm
Rule: walm -> repeated color of the previous word.,1.0,75,walm
Rule: walm -> three repetitions of the preceding color.,1.0,75,walm
"By examining the input-output pairs, we can attempt to infer the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"":

1. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug - Output: blue red green green red blue
2. Input: lug dax lug - Output: blue green blue
3. Input: dax bluf wif lug zup - Output: green green red blue yellow
4. Input: zup wif dax walm lug - Output: yellow red green green green blue
5. Input: zup dax lug - Output: yellow green blue

From the second input-output pair (lug dax lug), we see that ""lug"" matches with blue at the beginning and the end of the sequence. This suggests that ""lug"" correlates directly to ""blue"".

Now let's confirm this rule with other examples:

1. In the first input-output pair, the sequence starts with ""lug"" and ends with ""lug"", corresponding to ""blue"" at the beginning and the end in the output.
2. In the third pair, ""lug"" appears once and corresponds to ""blue"".
3. In the fourth pair, ""lug"" is at the end and corresponds to the ""blue"" at the end of the output sequence.
4. The fifth pair is a shortened version of the second pair and confirms the pattern with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"".

Since ""lug"" consistently correlates with ""blue"" in all given examples, the rule can be determined as:

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" means blue.

lug -> blue",1.0,76,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,76,lug

2. lug dax lug -> blue green blue
3. dax bluf wif lug zup -> green green red blue yellow
4. zup wif dax walm lug -> yellow red green green green blue
5. zup dax lug -> yellow green blue

By examining the pairs, we can look for patterns where ""lug"" appears and see what word it corresponds to in the output. We note the following observations:

- In the first example, ""lug"" appears at the beginning and at the end, with corresponding ""blue"" at the beginning and at the end of the output.
- In the second example, ""lug"" appears at the beginning and the end with ""blue"" at the corresponding positions.
- In the third example, ""lug"" precedes ""zup"" and is followed by ""blue,"" while ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" is at the end and corresponds to ""blue.""
- Lastly, in the fifth example, ""lug"" is at the end and corresponds to ""blue"" again.

- The second example, ""zup wif"", becomes ""yellow red"". ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red.""
- In the third example, ""dax zup wif"" is ""green yellow red"". We see that ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""zup"" still matches with ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" remains ""red.""
- The fourth example, ""wif dax"", is translated as ""red green"", where ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""dax"" is ""green.""
- The fifth example, ""wif zup dax bluf"", translates to ""red yellow green green"". Here, ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""bluf"" is not given a consistent color but we can assume from repetition that it also correlates to ""green.""

From these patterns, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red. The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""",1.0,76,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,76,wif
"From the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

- ""lug wif lug"" translates to ""blue red blue,"" which implies that ""wif"" is equivalent to ""red"" when it stands between two identical elements.
- ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red,"" which suggests that ""wif"" might again be ""red,"" following after ""zup"" which is ""yellow.""
- ""dax zup wif"" translates to ""green yellow red,"" which would mean that ""wif"" is again ""red.""
- ""wif dax"" translates to ""red green,"" which suggests that ""wif"" might be ""red"" preceding ""dax"" which is ""green.""
- ""wif zup dax bluf"" translates to ""red yellow green green,"" which again supports the idea that ""wif"" is ""red.""

Based on these examples, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" irrespective of its position or the words around it. Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,76,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in each of the given examples, regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,76,wif
"Rule: wif -> red

The examples show that whenever the word 'wif' appears in the input, the word 'red' appears in the corresponding position in the output. Therefore, 'wif' translates to 'red'.",1.0,76,wif
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,76,zup
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,76,zup
"Rule: zup means ""yellow"". 

Based on the examples provided, every time ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""yellow"" is included in the output correspondingly. Therefore:

zup -> yellow",1.0,76,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""",1.0,76,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it can be deduced that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". The meaning appears to be consistent across different contexts, as ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" regardless of the surrounding words.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,76,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to consistently correspond to a color output repeated twice. To determine specifically which color it translates to, we need to look at the patterns and compare.

- In the first example, ""bluf"" appears after ""dax,"" and the output is twice ""green.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the output is ""yellow"" repeated.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red"" two times.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" again, and similarly, the output is twice ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is ""green"" twice, similar to the first example.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" represents the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it, and it outputs that color twice.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before bluf twice.",1.0,76,bluf
"bluf -> green

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""green."" In all of the examples, the occurrence of ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the word ""green"" in the output sequence.",1.0,76,bluf
"Reviewing the examples given and the respective outputs, the word ""bluf"" appears to correlate with a color output that repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Each other word correlates to a unique color as follows:

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

Using this pattern, when ""bluf"" is used after a word, the output is a color that repeats the preceding color:

Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
Output: red green yellow red green green
Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to green, so ""bluf"" also becomes green.

Input: wif zup bluf
Output: red yellow yellow
""bluf"" follows ""zup"", which corresponds to yellow, so ""bluf"" is yellow.

Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
Output: red green red red yellow red
""bluf"" follows ""wif"", which is red, hence ""bluf"" is red here.

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red
""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red), so ""bluf"" is red.

Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
Output: blue red blue green green
""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (green), making ""bluf"" green.

Based on the above observations, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: bluf -> The word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that comes immediately before it.",1.0,76,bluf
"Examining the provided examples, we deduce the following:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" appears after ""wif dax"" and translates to ""green"".
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif zup"" and translates to ""yellow"".
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which comes after ""dax"" and it translates to ""red"".
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" after ""lug"" and it translates to ""red"".
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" appears after ""lug dax"" and translates to ""green"".

From these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color that corresponds to the word that precedes ""wif."" The previous color gets repeated. Here's the rule based on the examples:

- ""dax"" is associated with ""green"", so ""bluf"" after ""wif dax"" is ""green"".
- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"", so ""bluf"" after ""wif zup"" is ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" is not directly followed by ""wif"" in the data, but it appears that ""lug"" might be ""blue"", and thus unrelated to the ""bluf"" word directly.
- However, when the sequence ""wif lug dax"" occurs, ""bluf"" becomes ""green"", following the color of the word after ""lug"", which is ""dax"".

Let's formulate the rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color signified by the word that comes right before ""wif"". If ""wif"" comes directly after ""lug,"" which seems to represent ""blue"", the default color is ""red"". If ""wif"" is a part of a sequence, ""bluf"" matches the color of the word after ""lug"".

So, summarizing the rule:
bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the repetition of the color associated with the word that appears directly before ""wif."" If ""wif"" comes immediately after ""lug,"" the meaning defaults to ""red"". If ""wif"" precedes ""lug"" followed by another color term, ""bluf"" adopts that subsequent color.",0.8,76,bluf
"To determine what ""bluf"" means, we need to compare the input and output sequences. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

1. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
   Output: red green yellow red green green
Here, ""bluf"" at the end of the sequence corresponds to ""green"". However, this ""green"" follows a ""green"" which corresponds to ""dax"". We need more data to establish a pattern.

2. Input: wif zup bluf
   Output: red yellow yellow
Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"", but ""yellow"" also corresponds to ""zup"".

3. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
   Output: red green red red yellow red
Here, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" and corresponds to ""red"". Yet, in the same sequence, ""wif"" also corresponds to other ""red"" outputs.

4. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and corresponds to ""red"".

5. Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
   Output: blue red blue green green
In this case, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" and corresponds to ""green"" again.

Considering these examples, we can deduce that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color word that was previously mentioned. In other words, it repeats the color that was last stated before it. This pattern fits every sequence provided.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.",0.8,76,bluf
"Rule: The word ""walm"" means a repetition of the color that the word immediately preceding ""walm"" translates to, and it repeats that color three times. If a word is followed by ""walm"", whatever color it corresponds to, there will be three instances of that color following in the output.

For example:

- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"" since ""lug"" means ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes it to repeat two more times.
- ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"" since ""wif"" means ""red,"" and ""walm"" causes it to repeat two more times.
- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"" since ""dax"" means ""green,"" and ""walm"" causes it to repeat two more times.

Therefore:
walm -> meaning. The meaning is the repetition of the last mentioned color three times.",1.0,76,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" dictates the repetition of the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word in the sequence. Here is the pattern extracted from the given inputs and outputs:

- lug zup dax walm -> blue yellow green green green
  - The word before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" After ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated three times.

- dax wif walm -> green red red red
  - ""wif"" is before ""walm"" and corresponds to ""red."" ""Red"" is repeated three times after ""walm.""

- wif walm lug bluf -> red red red blue blue
  - ""wif"" is before ""walm"" and corresponds to ""red."" ""Red"" is repeated three times after ""walm,"" followed by another word sequence.

- dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
  - ""wif"" is before the first ""walm"" and corresponds to ""red,"" which is repeated three times. ""zup"" is before the second ""walm"" and corresponds to ""yellow,"" which is repeated three times.

- lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> blue blue red blue red red red blue
  - ""wif"" is before ""walm"" and corresponds to ""red."" ""Red"" is repeated three times after ""walm.""

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color of the word just before it to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.",1.0,76,walm
"From the given examples, we can see that the word ""walm"" has a specific pattern in its translation to colors. Let's analyze the corpus:

1. lug zup dax walm -> blue yellow green green green
2. dax wif walm -> green red red red
3. wif walm lug bluf -> red red red blue blue
4. dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
5. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> blue blue red blue red red red blue

In each case, the appearance of ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color that preceded it, with the repetition happening a number of times equal to the position of ""walm"" in the sequence (as per the immediate previous color instance). Here are the occurrences:

1. ""walm"" comes 4th -> green is repeated three additional times (for a total of four green entries).
2. ""walm"" comes 3rd -> red is repeated two additional times (for a total of three red entries).
3. ""walm"" comes 2nd -> red is repeated one additional time (for a total of two red entries).
4. ""walm"" happens both as the 3rd and 6th word:
   - First, ""walm"" comes 3rd -> red is repeated two additional times (for a total of three red entries).
   - Second, ""walm"" comes 6th -> yellow is repeated five additional times (for a total of six yellow entries).
5. ""walm"" comes 6th -> red is repeated five additional times (for a total of six red entries).

From the pattern observed, ""walm"" seems to mean ""repeat the preceding color a number of times equal to its position in the input series."" In other words, it is a function rather than a static word.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color a number of times equal to the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.",1.0,76,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" stands for a repetition of the color associated with the word directly preceding it. Let's analyze each example to understand the pattern:

1. lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green
   The word before ""walm"" is ""dax"" which corresponds to the color green. After ""walm,"" we see the color green repeated thrice.

2. dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   The word before ""walm"" is ""wif"" which corresponds to the color red. Following ""walm,"" the color red is repeated thrice.

3. wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   The word before ""walm"" is ""wif"" which corresponds to the color red. After ""walm,"" the color red is repeated thrice, followed by ""lug"" and ""bluf"" corresponding to their respective colors.

4. dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   The word before the first ""walm"" is ""wif"" which corresponds to red, resulting in red being repeated thrice. The word before the second ""walm"" is ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow, causing yellow to be repeated thrice.

5. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   The word before ""walm"" is ""wif"" which corresponds to red. Following ""walm,"" the color red is repeated thrice, followed by ""lug"" corresponding to its color blue.

Rule: walm -> repetition of the previous color, the number of repetitions seems to be three times.

Therefore: walm -> Repetition of the preceding color word three times.",1.0,76,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in the examples:

1. lug zup dax walm -> blue yellow green green green
2. dax wif walm -> green red red red
3. wif walm lug bluf -> red red red blue blue
4. dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
5. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> blue blue red blue red red red blue

If we examine each instance of ""walm"" within the inputs and its respective output, we can try to decipher a pattern.

- In the first input, ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color green three times.
- In the second and third inputs, ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of red three times.
- In the fourth input, ""walm"" comes after different combinations and corresponds to a repetition of the previously mentioned color three times (first red, then yellow).
- In the fifth input, ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color red three times.

Looking at the pattern, ""walm"" seems to cause a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it takes the color of the word right before it and repeats that color output three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the prior word three times.",1.0,76,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"". In every instance where ""lug"" is present in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

"lug -> blue

Rule: Every instance of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,77,lug
"Based on the examples provided, each instance of the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. Therefore, the rule for the word ""lug"" is consistent and independent of its position or surrounding words in the input sequence.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,77,lug
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,77,lug
"Given the examples provided, we can observe a pattern related to the colors that correspond to each input word. Here's a breakdown:

- Every time the word ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- When other words precede ""dax,"" like ""wif"" or ""bluf,"" other colors appear before ""green"" corresponding to each of those words.
- When ""dax"" appears alongside ""walm,"" the word ""green"" is repeated three times, suggesting that ""dax"" may be associated with the repetition of ""green.""
- In the last example, different words are associated with their respective colors, with ""dax"" still outputting ""green.""

Based on the consistent output associated with ""dax,"" regardless of context, it appears that ""dax"" directly translates to the color ""green"" without any conditionality.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,77,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,77,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, ""green"" appears in the output.

Additionally, other words seem to be associated with other colors; for example, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" and ""walm"" seems to correspond to ""green"" given that ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green."" However, the prompt asks to focus on the word ""dax,"" so the other colors will be noted but not formally defined in the rule.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,77,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words. Therefore, the rule for the word ""dax"" is that it translates to the color green.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,77,dax
"Given the examples, it seems that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" Furthermore, each word in the input translates to a specific color in the output.

Based on the given inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can infer the following rules:

- ""dax"" always maps to ""green.""
- ""wif"" appears to map to ""red.""
- ""bluf"" could likely map to ""green."" However, there's a discrepancy; the word ""bluf"" is present twice in the last input but does not appear in the output. Thus, we might need more examples to confirm the rule for ""bluf"" or consider that there may be a mistake in the given examples.
- ""walm"" seems to map to ""red,"" as seen in the last input where each ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the single ""walm"" leads to a single ""blue."" The use of ""walm"" in the fourth input led to three greens, which doesn't seem to match this pattern. As with ""bluf,"" this could either indicate there is more to the rule or there might be an error in the examples.
- ""lug"" maps to ""red,"" as seen in the last input.

Given these observations, the following could be inferred as the rule: dax -> green.",1.0,77,dax
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,77,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red."" Here are the observations that lead to this conclusion:

- In the first example, ""wif dax"" corresponds to ""red green,"" and given that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in both the first and second examples, it's reasonable to infer that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

- In the third example, ""lug walm wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue red,"" and since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the first and third examples, and ""walm"" is not present in the other examples but appears to be in a sequence with ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" it can again be inferred that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

- The fourth example, ""zup wif bluf,"" corresponds to ""yellow red red,"" suggesting that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" since ""bluf"" is doubled and corresponds to ""red"" in both the fourth and fifth examples, and ""zup"" is new but does not repeat and corresponds to ""yellow.""

- The fifth example shows ""wif"" both at the beginning and end of the sequence, circling around ""bluf zup bluf."" Since we have already associated ""bluf"" with ""red"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" and given that ""wif"" appears at both ends, it would be consistent with it representing the same color at the start and finish, which is ""red,"" reinforcing our earlier observations.

Based on these analyses, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red.,1.0,77,wif

The instances of the word ""zup"" are always followed by the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sentence.

The presence of ""zup"" in any position of the input results in ""yellow"" as the first color in the output sequence, regardless of the other words present.

"Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" while other words following ""zup"" translate to specific colors based on a consistent mapping, regardless of the order in which they appear. The presence of ""zup"" does not alter the color representation of other words.

- ""walm"" translates to ""green.""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

Thus, the rule is: zup -> ""yellow"".",1.0,77,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to result in the output being the same color as the word that preceded it. To confirm this, we can evaluate each example:

   - ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and results in another ""green""

   - ""dax"" is ""green""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and results in another ""green""

   - ""lug"" is noted here for the first time as ""blue""

Therefore, ""bluf"" appears to copy the color of the previous word. 

Rule: bluf -> copies the color of the preceding word.",1.0,77,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to cause the next word to take the color of the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" Therefore, if a word is followed by ""bluf,"" it repeats its assigned color for the next word.

Example breakdown:

- ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red,"" meaning ""bluf"" caused the subsequent word to be ""red"" since ""wif"" was ""red"".
- ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" meaning ""bluf"" caused the following word to be ""yellow"" since ""zup"" was ""yellow"".

Rule: bluf -> causes the subsequent word to repeat the color of the word immediately before ""bluf"".",1.0,77,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can examine the correspondence between the inputs and outputs given in the examples.

In each instance where ""bluf"" appears, the color immediately following ""bluf"" in the output is the same as the one that precedes it.

- In each sequence where ""bluf"" appears, the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""bluf"" is repeated. For example, in ""dax bluf"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and the output is ""green green"".
- In ""zup wif bluf"", ""wif"" is right before ""bluf"" and corresponds to ""red"", hence the output ""red red"" immediately following the ""yellow"" for ""zup"".

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we'll analyze the given input-output pairs and look for patterns.

From the first input-output pair:

From the second input-output pair:
- ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green.""

From the third input-output pair:
- ""zup wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow red red.""

From the fourth input-output pair:
- ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow.""

From the fifth input-output pair:
- ""dax bluf wif lug"" corresponds to ""green green red blue.""

1. ""dax"" leads to the output ""green.""
2. ""wif"" leads to the output ""red.""
3. ""zup"" leads to the output ""yellow.""
4. ""lug"" leads to the output ""blue.""

Now let's focus on ""bluf"":
- The presence of ""bluf"" after ""dax"" in the first and second examples led to a ""green"" which is the same as the output of ""dax.""
- The presence of ""bluf"" after ""zup"" in the third and fourth examples led to ""red"" and ""yellow"" respectively, with ""red"" repeating from ""wif"" in the third example, and the ""yellow"" matching the preceding ""zup"" in the fourth example.
- We have no examples of ""lug"" before ""bluf"", so no pattern can be observed there.

Given that ""bluf"" seems to replicate the color of the word that precedes it, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: bluf replicates the color output of the word that comes directly before it. 

Hence:
bluf -> meaning. ""bluf"" takes the color output of the preceding word. If the preceding word is ""dax,"" the color is green. If it's ""zup,"" the color is yellow. If it's ""wif,"" the color is red.

Input: zup dax walm
Output: yellow green green green
- ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and both are translated to ""green.""

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
- ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and both are translated to ""red.""

From the above examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is that it copies the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: walm repeats the color associated with the word that precedes it.",1.0,77,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the examples given:

1. When ""lug walm"" appears together in the first input, the output is ""blue blue."" When ""zup walm"" appears together, ""yellow yellow"" occurs in the output. This seems to indicate that ""walm"" may repeat the color that precedes it.

2. In the third input, ""zup wif lug zup walm"" leads to ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which supports the idea that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it.

3. In the fourth input, ""zup dax walm,"" the result is ""yellow green green green,"" further showing that ""walm"" could be repeating the color of the preceding word, which is ""green"" in this case.

4. In the fifth input, ""wif walm,"" we observe ""red red red,"" which again shows that ""walm"" replicates the color of the word preceding it.

Looking at all the examples, it's safe to deduce that:

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning. Meaning: the word ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.",1.0,77,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color that represents the word immediately preceding it three times.

- In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and when followed by ""walm,"" we get ""blue blue blue.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and when followed by ""walm,"" we get ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the third example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" appears after it, resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" generates ""green green green.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" results in ""red red red.""

Therefore:
walm -> Repetition of the color represented by the preceding word three times.",1.0,77,walm
"Based on the examples given, the outputs seem to consistently contain a sequence of identical color words following the appearance of the nonce word ""walm."" This pattern suggests that ""walm"" may indicate a repetition of the color word that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

Here's the breakdown:
1. ""lug walm zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow red,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" Following ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times.
2. ""zup walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red,"" where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Following ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
3. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" translates to ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" At the end of the sequence, ""yellow"" is repeated three times after ""walm.""
4. ""zup dax walm"" translates to ""yellow green green green,"" where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" Following ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated three times.
5. ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" Following ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated twice.

Rule: The term ""walm"" could be understood as a command to repeat the color corresponding to the word preceding it a number of times based on the position of “walm” in the sequence. If ""walm"" is the second word, the preceding color repeats twice. If ""walm"" is the third word, the preceding color repeats three times, and so on.

For precision, and based on the data we have, ""walm"" would lead to the following rule:

walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word, matching the count determined by the position of ""walm"" in the sequence. If ""walm"" is the nth word, repeat the color n-1 times.",0.8,77,walm
"To induce the meaning of ""walm"" from the examples provided, it is critical to observe the patterns in the outputs related to the position and occurrence of ""walm"" and the colors associated with it.

In the first example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" and followed by ""zup"" which translates to ""yellow,"" resulting in triple ""blue.""
Input: lug walm zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow red

In the second example, ""walm"" is again preceded by ""zup,"" this time which translates to ""yellow,"" and followed by ""lug"" translated to ""blue,"" resulting in triple ""yellow.""
Input: zup walm lug wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red

In the third example, ""walm"" is at the end, preceded by ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" resulting in quadruple ""yellow.""
Input: zup wif lug zup walm
Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

In the fourth example, ""walm"" is again preceded by ""dax,"" which has no previous occurrence to determine its meaning directly. Nevertheless, ""walm"" followed by ""dax"" results in triple ""green.""
Input: zup dax walm
Output: yellow green green green

In the last example, the term ""wif,"" which translates to ""red,"" precedes ""walm,"" and there is no word following ""walm."" The result is triple ""red.""
Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

From these examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" has a color replicating effect. When ""walm"" is preceded by a word, the color equivalent of that word is produced thrice when ""walm"" is within the string and four times if ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence. However, one anomaly to consider is the presence of ""dax,"" which occurs once and ultimately translates to ""green.""

Based on the above information, the rule we can induce is:
Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times in the output. If ""walm"" is at the end of the input sequence, the color repeats four times.

Hence:
walm -> cause the preceding word's color translation to repeat three times, four times if it ends the sequence.",0.8,77,walm

"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.",1.0,78,wif
"Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Here is the deduction:

- When ""wif"" is the only word in the input, the output is ""red"".
- When ""wif"" is preceded or followed by another word, the corresponding color for ""wif"" remains ""red"".
- Other words like ""zup"" and ""lug"" correspond to other colors (""zup"" -> ""yellow"", ""lug"" -> ""blue""), but ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red"" regardless of its position.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,78,wif

"zup -> yellow. 

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.",1.0,78,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each nonce word has a corresponding color as its meaning. The word ""zup"" is consistently mapped to the color yellow.

Rule: The word zup translates to the color ""yellow"" in all given examples.",1.0,78,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.",1.0,78,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green."" This can be inferred from the fact that each time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output at the same position relative to the other words.

Here's the breakdown of the examples:

1. Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green. ""Bluf"" parallels the placement of ""green"" directly.
2. Input: dax zup wif bluf lug -> Output: green yellow red red blue. ""Bluf"" corresponds to the second instance of ""red.""
3. Input: zup wif bluf -> Output: yellow red red. Again, ""bluf"" aligns with the second ""red.""
4. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif -> Output: red red green green red red red blue red. Both instances of ""bluf"" align with ""green.""
5. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> Output: yellow blue red green green red. ""Bluf"" corresponds to the first instance of ""green.""

Rule: bluf -> green",1.0,78,bluf
"By examining the input-output pairs, we can attempt to deduce the rule that governs ""bluf."" Let's examine each pair:

1. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
2. ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" -> ""green yellow red red blue""
3. ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red""
4. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" -> ""red red green green red red red blue red""
5. ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" -> ""yellow blue red green green red""

Consider ""wif bluf"" that appears in several examples:

- In (3), ""zup wif bluf"" becomes ""yellow red red""; ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and both instances of ""bluf"" come after ""wif.""
- In (4), ""wif bluf"" translates twice to ""red red,"" and when it is followed by ""dax,"" a ""green"" appears: ""wif bluf dax bluf"" -> ""red red green green.""
- In (5), after ""dax,"" which translates to ""green,"" ""bluf"" is again ""green"": ""dax bluf wif"" -> ""green green red.""

From these observations, we can surmise that ""bluf"" takes the color of the previous non-""bluf"" word. If there is no preceding word (as in example 1), ""bluf"" might default to ""green"" (which might also be the default color for ""dax"").

Hence, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the color of the preceding word in the sequence. If ""bluf"" is the first word or if the preceding word is ""dax"" (which translates to ""green""), then ""bluf"" translates to ""green.""",0.9,78,bluf
"To determine what the nonce word ""bluf"" means, we need to identify any patterns that are consistent across the examples provided. Each given input is translated to a series of color outputs. It seems that each word in the input maps to a specific color in the output. Let's analyze the data:

1. Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green
From this example, we can see that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Since ""bluf"" also translates to ""green,"" we might initially think ""bluf"" also means ""green.""

2. Input: dax zup wif bluf lug -> Output: green yellow red red blue
Here we see ""dax"" again, which confirms that it corresponds to ""green."" We introduce new words ""zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""lug,"" which correspond to ""yellow,"" ""red,"" and ""blue,"" respectively. The word ""bluf"" in this context again results in the color ""red,"" which is different from the first example. This inconsistency indicates that ""bluf"" does not consistently translate to a fixed color but might depend on context.

3. Input: zup wif bluf -> Output: yellow red red
Here ""zup"" and ""wif"" again translate to ""yellow"" and ""red,"" respectively. Another ""bluf"" results in ""red"" again, which matches the second example but not the first.

4. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif -> Output: red red green green red red red blue red
We can confirm that ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" The term ""walm"" seems to correspond to ""red."" It seems that ""bluf"" in positions immediately after ""dax"" results in ""green,"" while in all other positions, it results in ""red.""

5. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> Output: yellow blue red green green red
In this example, ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""dax"" still correspond to ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" ""red,"" and ""green,"" respectively, and ""bluf"" that follows ""dax"" results in ""green"" again.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" is context-dependent. When ""bluf"" appears immediately after ""dax,"" it results in ""green."" In all other cases, ""bluf"" translates to ""red."" Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" mirrors the color output of the word that precedes it, except when that word is ""dax,"" in which case ""bluf"" always translates to ""green.""

Rule: bluf -> green when immediately following ""dax;"" otherwise, bluf takes the color of the immediate preceding word.",0.9,78,bluf
"From the given examples, we can induce the following about the nonce word ""bluf"":

- Whenever ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""green green,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" following ""dax"" translates to ""green."" Hence, the rule for ""dax bluf"" seems to consistently produce ""green green.""

- In all instances where ""bluf"" is not preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""red red,"" irrespective of other words around it. See the examples ""zup wif bluf"" and ""wif bluf dax bluf wif"".

Given this, we can conclude the following rule:

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", output ""green."" In all other cases, output ""red.""

So, the meaning of ""bluf"" based on its position relative to ""dax"" is as follows:

bluf -> meaning: If preceded by ""dax"", it means ""green""; otherwise, it means ""red"".",0.8,78,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can analyze the correspondence between the inputs and outputs to deduce the meaning or pattern of the word ""bluf.""

For every example where ""bluf"" appears, the consistent output is ""green."" Let's look at the correspondences:

- In the first example, ""dax bluf"" maps to ""green green."" Since ""bluf"" appears in the second position, the second ""green"" in the output corresponds with ""bluf.""
 
- In the second example, ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" maps to ""green yellow red red blue."" Here ""bluf"" is in the fourth position, which matches the fourth ""green"" in the output.

- The third example, ""zup wif bluf,"" maps to ""yellow red red."" Similarly, ""bluf"" matches the last ""red,"" which is an error according to the previous patterns.

- The fourth example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif,"" maps to ""red red green green red red red blue red."" Both ""bluf"" instances correspond with a ""green"" in the output.

- In the final example, ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif,"" maps to ""yellow blue red green green red."" The ""bluf"" corresponds with the second ""green.""

Except for the anomaly in the third example, the pattern suggests that ""bluf"" corresponds with the color ""green"" in the output. Assuming the anomaly in the third example is either a mistake or an exception we don't have enough information to explain, the rule seems to be that:

Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.

Therefore:

bluf -> green",0.8,78,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" I will look for patterns in the given examples, focusing on the surrounding words and the corresponding colors in the output. Here are the observations based on the examples provided:

1. In the first and second examples, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" and ""wif lug walm"" leads to ""red blue blue blue."" Here, we notice that the presence of ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in two additional ""blue"" in the output.

2. In the third example, ""wif walm lug wif"" has ""walm"" between ""wif"" and ""lug,"" which results in ""red red red blue"" in the output. 

3. The fourth and fifth examples both start with ""zup walm,"" which results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" in the output for the fourth example. The fifth example begins with ""zup"" and also includes ""zup walm"" further in, each time ""walm"" following ""zup"" corresponds with three instances of ""yellow"" in the output.

Considering these observations, there seems to be a pattern where ""walm"" takes on the color corresponding to the word immediately before it and causes this color to repeat three times. ""Lug"" correlates with ""blue"" and ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"". In contexts with ""wif lug walm,"" ""wif"" being red does not impact the repetition associated with ""walm"". 

Therefore, the rule to describe ""walm"" appears to be the following:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color-associated word, the output repeats the color corresponding to that word three times.

Thus, we get:

walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.",0.9,78,walm
"Rule: walm -> ""blue repeated the number of times the word before ""walm"" is repeated before it appears"". 

This rule is derived from observing that ""walm"" appears to translate to a sequence of ""blue(s)"" and the number of ""blue"" repetitions corresponds to the number of times the preceding word is mentioned in the given series before ""walm"" is encountered. For instance:

- In ""lug walm"", ""lug"" is repeated twice, hence ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"".
- In ""wif lug walm"", ""lug"" is mentioned once, so ""walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"".
- In the case of ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm"", ""wif"" is mentioned twice, leading to ""walm"" being ""blue red"".
- With ""zup walm"", ""zup"" is mentioned once, which results in ""walm"" being ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- Lastly, in ""zup bluf lug zup walm"", ""zup"" is mentioned twice, and so ""walm"" entails ""yellow yellow yellow"".

Based on these observations, it stands to reason that ""walm"" involves repeating the word ""blue"" in accordance with the repetition count of the preceding word.",0.8,78,walm
"Analyzing the given examples, the word ""walm"" appears to directly influence the output in a specific way.

1. In the first example, ""lug walm zup lug walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue."" The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and the word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Every time ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" or ""zup,"" it seems to insert repetitions of the color associated with the previous word. After ""lug,"" two additional ""blue"" words appear, and after ""zup,"" two additional ""yellow"" words appear.

2. In the second example, ""wif lug walm,"" the output is ""red blue blue blue."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and again causes repetitions of ""blue.""

3. The third example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif,"" the output is ""red red green green red red red blue red."" ""Walm"" comes after ""wif"" and before ""lug,"" and the output corresponding to ""walm"" in this case is a single ""blue."" This is consistent with the idea that ""walm"" causes a repetition because ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" didn't cause a repetition of ""red"" but occurs before ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue.""

4. The fourth example, ""zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow."" Just like the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" causes two additional repetitions of the color.

5. The fifth example, ""zup bluf lug zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" This reinforces the idea that ""walm"" causes repetitions of the color associated with the previous word, as ""yellow"" repeats two times after ""zup.""

Based on all these observations, it seems that ""walm"" is a modifier that causes the repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. Specifically, it repeats the color two additional times when ""walm"" is preceded by either ""lug"" or ""zup.""

Rule:
walm -> causes the repetition of the color word that comes immediately before it two additional times.",0.8,78,walm
"Analyzing the provided examples, one can attempt to determine the meaning or pattern associated with the word ""walm."" Here's what is observed:

1. Whenever ""walm"" appears, a sequence of ""blue"" follows in the output.
2. The length of the ""blue"" sequence seems to depend on the preceding words.
3. The word immediately preceding ""walm"" appears to influence the number of times ""blue"" is repeated. 
   - When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times.
   - Without a clear preceding word, as in the case of ""zup walm,"" ""blue"" is not outputted; instead, we have ""yellow"" repeated.
   - The sequence ""wif lug walm"" leads to ""blue"" repeated three times after ""wif,"" which results in ""red.""
4. It is not completely clear how ""walm"" is influenced by preceding words other than ""lug,"" given the limited examples, specifically since ""zup walm"" gives ""yellow"" but does not contain ""blue"" at all.

Given these observations, a tentative rule can be established:

Rule: ""walm"" translates to a repeated sequence of ""blue"" in the output. The number of times ""blue"" is repeated is determined by the word immediately preceding ""walm"":
- ""lug"" before ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue.""
- ""wif"" before ""walm"" does not change the pattern induced by ""lug.""
- Further examination or examples would be needed to fully understand how other words before ""walm"" affect the output.

Thus, the tentative rule is:

walm -> A sequence of ""blue"" in the output, the number of ""blue"" repetitions is influenced by the preceding word, with ""lug"" specifically leading to three ""blue"" outcomes.",0.7,78,walm
"Based on the provided examples and their corresponding outputs, there appears to be a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" Here's the pattern analysis:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears, a sequence of ""blue"" follows in the output.
- The number of ""blue"" words in the output sequence directly correlates to the number of words preceding ""walm"" in the input sequence.

Let's analyze the examples:

1. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   There are two ""lug"" words before the first ""walm,"" leading to three ""blue."" Then one ""zup"" before the second ""walm,"" again leading to three ""blue"" after a single ""yellow.""

2. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   There are two words ""wif lug"" before ""walm,"" resulting in three ""blue.""

3. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   There are six words before ""walm,"" thus creating seven ""blue,"" but we only see one ""blue,"" indicating that the rule might be interrupted by another word after ""walm.""

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   There is one ""zup"" before ""walm,"" resulting in two ""blue,"" but instead, there are three ""yellow,"" suggesting that ""zup"" could change the expected pattern of ""blue.""

5. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   There are four words before ""walm,"" which would normally result in five ""blue,"" but instead, we have a series of ""yellow"" except for one ""blue"" after a ""bluf.""

Considering these observations, the preliminary rule for ""walm"" might be disrupted by specific words (like ""zup"") which affect the pattern of the color output.

Rule: ""walm"" leads to a sequential output of ""blue"" corresponding to the number of words preceding ""walm"" in the input sequence. If ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow"" rather than ""blue.""

Hence, the possible rule for ""walm"" is that it represents a sequence of ""blue"" equal to one more than the number of words immediately preceding it, with exceptions or modifications based on specific words like ""zup.""

Walm -> A sequence of ""blue"" where the number of ""blue"" in the sequence is one more than the number of words immediately preceding ""walm,"" with certain words like ""zup"" causing an exception to this rule and producing ""yellow"" instead.",0.6,78,walm
"To figure out the rule for what ""lug"" means, let's compare the inputs and outputs:

1. Input: ""zup lug walm wif walm""
   Output: ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""
   
   From this we see that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" The unknown word ""lug"" appears to translate to ""blue"" in this context since it appears between ""zup"" (yellow) and ""walm"" (blue).

2. Input: ""wif zup lug wif""
   Output: ""red yellow blue red""
   
   Here ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue"" between ""zup"" (yellow) and ""wif"" (red).
   
3. Input: ""dax lug bluf dax""
   Output: ""green blue blue green""
   
   We learn a new word ""dax,"" which is ""green"" and ""bluf,"" which is used once with no direct translation in the output. Again, ""lug"" is followed by the color ""blue.""

4. Input: ""zup lug""
   Output: ""yellow blue""
   
   Again, ""lug"" translates directly to ""blue"" following ""zup"" (yellow).
   
5. Input: ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif""
   Output: ""blue green green yellow blue red""
   
   This sequence confirms that ""dax"" is ""green"" and we can deduce ""lug"" as ""blue"" both before ""dax"" and following ""zup.""

In all examples, ""lug"" directly corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the surrounding context or words. There are no examples where ""lug"" translates to any color other than ""blue.""

"Based on the given examples, the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence. The other words in the examples correspond to different colors and seem consistent in their translation to a specific color each time they appear. Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""lug"" can be stated as:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,79,lug
"Observing the patterns in the examples provided, it seems that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the output ""blue.""

Thus, we can deduce that ""lug"" directly corresponds to the color blue.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,79,lug
"Based on the given examples, we can observe a pattern corresponding to the word ""dax"" and its output in various contexts. When ""dax"" appears in the sequence, it is translated to the color ""green."" Therefore, regardless of its position in the input sequence, ""dax"" consistently maps to the color green in the output.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,79,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can analyze the relationship between the input words and their corresponding output colors to deduce the meaning of ""dax.""

In every instance of the input, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green."" There are no examples provided where ""dax"" translates to any other color. This consistent one-to-one relationship between ""dax"" and ""green"" across different contexts (whether ""dax"" appears at the beginning, middle, or end of the input sequence) suggests a simple rule.

Thus, the rule that can be induced from these examples is:

dax -> green

"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color green regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,79,dax

   ""Dax"" is in the middle and translates to green.

From these examples, it seems clear that ""dax"" is consistently translated to the color green, independent of its position or the surrounding words.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,79,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" by examining each instance where it appears:

From the examples, we can observe that the appearance of ""zup"" is consistently followed by the output ""yellow."" Additionally, other words also correlate with specific colors:

- ""wif"" correlates with ""red""
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue""
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green""
- ""bluf"" correlates with ""red""

Thus, when other words appear in the input before or after ""zup,"" their corresponding colors appear before or after ""yellow"" in the output. It seems that ""zup"" may act as a placeholder for the color ""yellow"" within a sequence of colors that correspond to other words in the input.

The other words in the input correspond to a specific color as well, with 'wif' translating to 'red', 'lug' to 'blue', and 'dax' to 'green'. The presence of 'zup' in the inputs always results in 'yellow' appearing in the corresponding location in the outputs, regardless of its position in the sequence.

2. ""lug walm dax"" translates to ""blue blue blue green,"" where ""blue"" is repeated three times because it comes after ""lug,"" which is associated with ""blue.""

3. ""dax walm zup lug dax"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue green,"" where ""green"" is repeated three times because it comes after ""dax,"" which is associated with ""green.""

4. ""zup walm wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" where ""yellow"" is repeated three times because it comes after ""zup,"" which is associated with ""yellow.""

5. ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" translates to ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue,"" where ""red"" is repeated three times because it follows ""wif,"" which is associated with ""red,"" and then ""blue"" is repeated three times, following ""lug"" which is associated with ""blue.""

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" every time it appears. There is a consistent pattern where each instance of ""wif"" is translated to ""red"" regardless of its position in the input. Therefore, the rule can be formulated as:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,80,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Here is the deduction process:

- ""wif lug wif"" translates to ""red blue red,"" which implies that both instances of ""wif"" are consistently translated to ""red.""

- ""zup wif walm lug"" yields ""yellow red red red blue,"" suggesting that ""wif"" represents ""red,"" as it is the only instance of ""wif"" in the input and corresponds to the first ""red"" in the output.

- ""wif zup"" turns into ""red yellow,"" again indicating ""wif"" is ""red.""

- ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" converts to ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green."" Here, the position of the word ""wif"" aligns with the position of the color ""red.""

- Finally, ""wif walm dax"" translates to ""red red red green,"" which further reinforces that ""wif"" is equivalent to ""red,"" especially since other words such as ""walm"" and ""dax"" do not contradict this rule in the given examples.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,80,wif
"From the examples provided, we can induce the following:

Input: zup 
Output: yellow

Both instances of ""zup"" input by itself produce the output ""yellow."" This direct association suggests that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" However, in inputs with multiple words, there's a pattern that indicates each word corresponds to a different color:

Input: lug zup wif lug 
Output: blue yellow red blue

Here, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""wif"" to red. The order of colors in the output matches the order of the words in the input.

Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf 
Output: yellow green yellow green red red

In this example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""dax"" to green, ""wif"" to red, and ""bluf"" results in repeating the color that precedes it. The word ""bluf"" does not have its own corresponding color but affects the preceding color by duplicating it.

Input: lug dax zup dax wif 
Output: blue green yellow green red

This example reinforces the associations made above: ""lug"" with blue, ""dax"" with green, ""zup"" with yellow, and ""wif"" with red.

Based on these examples, the rule for ""zup"" seems straightforward:
zup -> yellow.",1.0,80,zup
"Based on the given examples, the following patterns can be observed:

- Whenever ""zup"" appears alone, the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""zup"" appears in sequences with other words, it consistently translates to ""yellow"" as well.

Since there is no indication that ""zup"" changes meaning based on context or position, the rule seems to be straightforward:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,80,zup
"Based on the examples provided the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" In all instances of its use, zup corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output. Therefore, the rule is:

"zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the given examples.",1.0,80,zup
"Based on the patterns observed from the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color that precedes it. Here is a breakdown of the observed pattern:

- In ""lug bluf wif,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""bluf"" also corresponds to blue.
- In ""wif bluf zup,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" also corresponds to red.
- In ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug,"" ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word before it, which are green and yellow, respectively.
- In ""dax wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" also corresponds to red.
- In ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""bluf"" also corresponds to green.

Therefore, the induction rule for the word ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the same color as the word immediately before bluf. Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word.",1.0,80,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to act as a mirror or duplicator of the color word that comes before it. If no color word comes before ""bluf"", then it takes the color value of the word it follows. Here are the observations supporting the rule:

- In the first example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"", indicating that ""bluf"" duplicates the color ""blue"" that comes before it.
- In the second example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"", again showing that ""bluf"" duplicates the preceding color ""red"".
- In the third example, ""bluf wif zup bluf lug"" translates to ""green red yellow yellow blue"", so in the case of ""zup bluf"", since ""zup"" comes before ""bluf"" and translates to ""yellow"", ""bluf"" duplicates ""yellow"". However, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"", and ""bluf"" again duplicates the color ""green"" from ""dax"".
- The fourth example, ""dax wif bluf"", translates to ""green red red"", where ""bluf"" duplicates the ""red"" from ""wif"".
- The fifth example, ""dax bluf"", translates to ""green green"", reinforcing that ""bluf"" duplicates the preceding color.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Duplicates the color of the preceding word. If there is no preceding color, it duplicates the color of the following word.",1.0,80,bluf
"From the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" is translated to a color. In the first example, ""lug"" is translated to ""blue,"" and when ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" it is also translated to ""blue,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word before it. In the second example, ""wif"" is translated to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" following ""wif"" is translated to ""red"" as well, again taking on the color of the preceding word. This pattern repeats in the subsequent examples.

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. If there is no preceding color word, it defaults to green, as seen in the last example where ""dax bluf"" produces ""green green.""

bluf -> the color of the preceding word (default to green if no preceding color word)",1.0,80,bluf

"Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color mentioned immediately before it. If no color is mentioned before it, it takes the color mentioned after it.",0.8,80,bluf
Rule: The word walm corresponds to a series of blue tokens in the output. The number of blue tokens seems to be one less than the number of tokens that precede walm in the input.,1.0,80,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in the provided examples and their respective outputs:

1. dax walm zup lug walm -> green green green yellow blue blue blue
2. wif dax lug walm -> red green blue blue blue
3. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
4. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
5. lug walm zup lug zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

From the examples above, the word 'walm' appears after different words and is followed by multiple instances of the color that was mentioned immediately before it. Therefore, it seems that 'walm' indicates repetition of the most recent color. Let's test this rule against the given examples.

1. green green green (dax is green, so 'walm' repeats the green three times)
2. red green blue blue blue (lug is blue, so 'walm' repeats the blue three times)
3. yellow yellow yellow (zup is yellow, so 'walm' repeats the yellow three times)
4. green blue blue blue (lug is blue, so 'walm' repeats the blue three times)
5. blue blue blue yellow blue yellow (lug is blue, so 'walm' repeats the blue three times, and the sequence continues as normal afterward)

This rule seems to fit all the examples provided. Therefore, the rule for 'walm' can be summarized as:

Rule: 'walm' causes the most recently stated color to be repeated three times.",1.0,80,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns associated with each output color:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red

Now, let's see what happens when ""walm"" is present.

- In the first input, 'walm' is followed by 'lug' and 'zup', the output colors are blue and yellow, respectively, which are the original colors for 'lug' and 'zup' but 'walm' itself is followed by green.
- In the second input, 'walm' follows 'lug' and it results in three consecutive blues.
- In the third input, 'walm' follows 'zup' and it results in three yellows.
- In the fourth input, 'walm' follows 'lug' again and it results in three blues.
- In the fifth input, 'walm' follows 'lug', and like before, the output is three blues plus, all the subsequent colors match the original associations of each word.

From these examples, it seems that the presence of the word ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the prior word. 

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the previous word three times.",0.9,80,walm
"From the provided examples, we can try to find a pattern. Let's analyze the occurrences:

- First example: ""dax walm zup lug walm"" correlates to ""green green green yellow blue blue blue.""
- Second example: ""wif dax lug walm"" correlates with ""red green blue blue blue.""
- Third example: ""zup walm"" correlates with ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- Fourth example: ""dax lug walm"" correlates with ""green blue blue blue.""
- Fifth example: ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" correlates with ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red.""

By looking at these examples, it seems that ""walm"" correlates with a sequence of repeating colors. Specifically, ""walm"" seems to be a command that repeats the color prior to its mention in the output. For example, when the sequence is ""dax walm,"" ""green"" is repeated three times, and when the sequence contains ""lug walm,"" we see that ""blue"" is repeated three times.

However, the repetition is not always three times; the number of repetitions seems to depend on the context within the sequence of words. For example, in the second example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times. In the fourth example, the same ""lug walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated three times again.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the word directly preceding it. The number of repetitions can be deduced from the context; in the given examples, the number is three.

walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.",0.9,80,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can compare the outputs across the different inputs and look for patterns.

Input: dax walm zup lug walm
Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

Input: wif dax lug walm
Output: red green blue blue blue

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

Noticing in each output, the term ""walm"" appears to output a sequence of the same color. Breaking it down:

- In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""green green green."" But this instance is a little misleading because ""dax"" also maps to ""green,"" so we can't be sure ""walm"" produces the three greens here.
- In the second example, the sequence ""blue blue blue"" follows ""walm.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""blue blue blue"" follows ""walm.""
- In the last example, ""walm"" is followed by ""blue blue blue"" again, and since ""lug"" is before and after ""walm"" and maps to ""blue"" as well, we can more confidently say that ""walm"" outputs a sequence of the same color (blue in this case).

We can observe that ""walm"" is followed by a three-color repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" 

Rule: walm -> a repetition of the color that corresponds to the color of the word before it, three times.

So if ""lug"" is blue and ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" then ""walm"" means ""blue blue blue."" If ""zup"" is yellow and ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" then ""walm"" means ""yellow yellow yellow."" And if ""dax"" is green and ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" then in this context, ""walm"" means ""green green green,"" although in the first example ""dax"" was already assigned green, making ""walm"" appear redundant or ambiguous.

The combination of ""dax"" with ""lug"" results in ""green blue,"" suggesting ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, and ""dax"" with ""wif"" results in ""green red,"" suggesting ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.

"Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding 'walm' the same number of times as the number of letters in the preceding word.

Explanation: In each instance, the word that comes before 'walm' has its corresponding color repeated as many times as there are letters in the word.

- dax walm lug -> green green green blue ('dax' has three letters, hence 'green' is repeated three times, followed by the color for 'lug')
- dax walm -> green green green ('dax' has three letters, hence 'green' is repeated three times)
- dax walm wif walm -> green green green red red red (first 'walm' repeats 'green' three times for 'dax', second 'walm' repeats 'red' three times for 'wif')

- zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow ('zup' has three letters, hence 'yellow' is repeated three times)",1.0,81,walm

"Based on the given examples, we can attempt to identify patterns that could help deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" To do so, let's analyze the correlation between the input and the output.

- Whenever ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green.""
- Whenever ""walm"" appears on its own or without ""lug"" following it, the output is the repetition of the same color corresponding to the word before ""walm.""
- When ""walm"" appears after ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- When ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" the color blue is added to the output.
- When ""walm"" is repeated in the input, the color red is repeated in the output.

From the patterns above, it seems that ""walm"" is related to the repetition of the last color mentioned before it, except when followed by the word ""lug"" (which corresponds to blue) or when it is repeated itself (which corresponds to red). However, there is not enough evidence to associate ""walm"" with a specific color.

2. The repeated color depends on the word that comes immediately before ""walm.""
3. The word before ""walm"" determines the color output for ""walm"" as seen in the outputs, except for ""dax walm,"" which only contains ""dax"" before ""walm.""

- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" (""wif walm""), the output is ""red red red.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" (""dax walm""), the output is ""green green green.""
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" (""lug walm""), the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- In the example ""zup wif lug zup walm,"" the word ""zup"" is followed by multiple ""yellow"" (output), but it's not immediately before ""walm"", thus the pattern is not applicable here.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word's output three times.",1.0,82,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look for a pattern in how it affects the output.

   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

5. Input: wif walm dax

Looking at the pattern, we can notice the following:
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it repeats the color associated with ""wif,"" which is red.
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it repeats the color associated with ""lug,"" which is blue.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" it repeats the color associated with ""dax,"" which is green.
- ""walm"" does not appear following ""zup,"" so we don't have an example that shows its effect after ""zup.""

3. When ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" with no further context:

Therefore:
walm -> meaning. Repeats the color of the previous word.",0.8,82,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's analyze the output for each example and look for patterns associated with the appearance of ""walm"".

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

2. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   ""Walm"" appears at the end of the sequence.

3. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   ""Walm"" again appears at the end.

4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   ""Walm"" is at the end and when paired with ""dax"".

5. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   ""Walm"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""dax"".

From these patterns, it appears that ""walm"" has an impact on the output color sequence. Relevant observations include:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears, the color immediately preceding ""walm"" repeats for the number of letters in ""walm"", which is 4. For example, in ""wif walm dax"", ""wif"" leads to the color ""red"", so the output is ""red"" repeated thrice followed by the color indicated by ""dax"", which is ""green"".
- When ""walm"" is at the end, the color corresponding to the preceding word is repeated according to the number of characters in ""walm"". For example, in the sequence ""wif dax lug walm"", ""lug"" outputs ""blue"", and the sequence ends with ""blue blue blue"".

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" may be deduced as:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input sequence, the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" in the output is repeated 4 times (since ""walm"" has 4 letters). If ""walm"" is the last word, the preceding color continues for the remaining output sequence.

- In ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"", the words ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""green,"" ""yellow,"" ""red,"" and ""red"" respectively, and as we follow the rule, ""lug"" still corresponds to ""blue"".

From this, we can establish the rule:

The word bluf consistently translates to the color yellow in the outputs. Each instance of ""bluf"" in the inputs corresponds to ""yellow"" in the outputs, regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,83,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> yellow

The reason for this rule is consistent through the examples provided. Every time the word bluf appears in the input, the word yellow is outputted. There is a direct one-to-one correspondence between ""bluf"" in input and ""yellow"" in the output.

- In the first example, ""zup wif bluf,"" ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is followed by ""red,"" and ""bluf"" is followed by ""red."" Since ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" in this instance, it may seem at first that ""bluf"" should mean ""red,"" but looking at the other examples clarifies that this isn't the case.

- In the second example, even though it is the same as the first, the repetition confirms the sequence.

- In the third example, ""zup bluf wif bluf,"" the appearance of ""bluf"" twice corresponds to two ""yellow"" outputs, sandwiching the ""red"" output from ""wif"".

- In the fourth example, ""dax zup bluf,"" the word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" again to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" once more to ""yellow.""

- In the fifth example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" still corresponds to ""yellow"" with each occurrence.

Therefore, observing the pattern that wherever the word ""bluf"" appears, a ""yellow"" follows in the output, we can determine that ""bluf"" means ""yellow.""",1.0,83,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule behind ""walm"" by comparing the input and output sequences.

- When we see ""dax walm"" together, we get ""green green green"" in the output.
- When ""wif walm"" appears, it becomes ""red red red"" in the output.
- ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow red red red"".

With these observations, we can see that the output starts with the color associated with the word preceding ""walm"", followed by a consistent ""red red"". However, in the case of ""zup wif walm"", the color sequence begins with ""yellow"" from ""zup"" and not ""red"" for ""wif"". Therefore, ""walm"" seems to introduce a pattern that starts with repeating the color associated with the word directly before it, and then continues with two ""red"".

Using this pattern, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the color associated with the word directly preceding ""walm"" followed by ""red red"".",0.9,83,walm
"From the given examples, we can infer that the output is generated based on the input words and their positions. 'Walm' seems to influence the output by generating a sequence of colors. We can determine its meaning by looking at the patterns preceding and following its occurrence:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the output is ""green green green"".
2. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", the output is ""red red red"".
3. When ""walm"" follows ""zup"", the output changes to ""red red red"" from the previously consistent ""yellow"".

This suggests that ""walm"" acts as a sort of amplifier or multiplier for the color that would be produced by the word just before it. ""Dax"" corresponding to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"", then ""walm"" causes the preceding color to be outputted three times.

Therefore, we can formulate the rule:

walm -> Triples the color corresponding to the previous word.

Rule: If 'walm' follows 'dax', output 'green' three times. If 'walm' follows 'wif', output 'red' three times. If 'walm' follows 'zup', despite 'zup' normally corresponding to 'yellow', output 'red' three times as well, indicating a potential exception or a different rule at play for the combination of 'zup wif walm'.",0.9,83,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we observe the following:

1. The appearance of ""walm"" after ""dax"" leads to the sequence green green green.
2. When ""walm"" appears after ""wif"", it leads to the sequence red red red.
3. When ""walm"" follows ""zup"", it results in the sequence red red.
4. ""walm"" does not seem to have a fixed number of words it affects; it could be three or two, depending on the word that precedes it.

To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", we can consider that it somehow affects the number of colors produced and the specific colors that follow. It appears like ""walm"" is a function of the preceding word, causing repetition of a specific color - the respective outputs being one green for ""dax"", three reds for ""wif"", and two reds for ""zup"".

Hence, the rule might be:
- dax walm -> three greens
- wif walm -> three reds
- zup walm -> two reds

Thus, we can write:
walm -> meaning. Meaning: walm causes a repetition of a specific color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: If the word before ""walm"" is ""dax"", it outputs green green green. If it is ""wif"", it outputs red red red. If it is ""zup"", it outputs red red.",0.9,83,walm
"Analyzing the examples given, we can attempt to identify a pattern that leads to the appropriate output. Here's what we observe:

- When the word ""walm"" appears, a sequence of ""red"" begins in the output.
- The ""red"" sequence continues until a new word (not ""walm"") appears. That word is then given a color, and the pattern resets.
- The number of ""red"" outputs corresponds to the number of times ""walm"" is mentioned before another non-""walm"" word is encountered.
- For example: ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"", so it appears that ""wif"" outputs ""red"" and ""walm"" also causes additional ""red"" outputs.
- In the instances ""wif walm"" and ""zup wif walm"", it can be observed that ""walm"" seems to cause a repeating effect of the color assigned to the previous word, indicating that ""walm"" may represent repetition or a continuation.

Considering the information above, we can formulate the following rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeats the color output of the previous word until a new word is encountered.",0.8,83,walm
"Based on the given examples, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" seems connected to the production of a sequence of ""red"" outputs. Specifically, the word ""walm"" is directly followed by a sequence of reds equal to the number of times ""walm"" is mentioned in the input plus one. If ""walm"" appears once, it results in a sequence of triple reds; when it appears twice in a row, the output is a sequence of four reds, and so on.

Here are the observed rules applied to each example:

- In the first input, ""walm"" occurs twice, separated by other words, and thus each occurrence of ""walm"" is followed by a sequence of triple reds.
- In the second input, ""walm"" occurs once and is followed by a sequence of triple reds.
- In the third input, ""walm"" occurs twice in a row. However, no additional green is provided, suggesting that the sequence is dependent on the number of times ""walm"" appears without interruption by other non-""walm"" terms.
- In the fourth input, ""walm"" occurs once and is followed by a sequence of triple reds.
- In the fifth input, ""walm"" occurs once and is followed by a sequence of triple reds.

Given this observation, the rule can be written as:

Rule: walm -> the presence of ""walm"" in the input generates a sequence of red outputs, where the number of reds equals the number of times ""walm"" is mentioned consecutively plus one. If ""walm"" is not followed by another ""walm,"" it produces a triple red output.",0.8,83,walm

"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax."" Let's analyze the patterns:

1. Every time ""dax"" is mentioned alone, the output is ""green.""
2. When ""dax"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the outputs are ""red green"" and ""green red,"" suggesting that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green,"" while ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" irrespective of the order they appear in.
3. In the sequence ""wif lug dax walm,"" the given output is ""red blue green green green,"" where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" again.
4. In the sequence ""wif zup wif dax,"" the word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" as the last color in the output sequence.

Given these inputs and outputs, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,84,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,84,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that each nonce word is associated with a specific color in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. We can see that every time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. There are no examples where ""wif"" yields a different color, indicating that ""wif"" refers consistently to the color red.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

wif -> red",1.0,84,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each time the word ""wif"" is used, the output is ""red."" There's a one-to-one correspondence between the usage of ""wif"" and the output ""red,"" regardless of the context it's used in. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,84,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word corresponds to a specific color in the output:

- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red.""
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" (seen in the first and third examples).
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" (seen in the second and fourth examples).
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" (seen in the second example).
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" (seen in the first example).

Each input word seems to be translated to a color word, with ""wif"" uniquely translating to red every time it appears, regardless of its position in the sequence. Thus, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,84,wif
"Rule: wif -> red

Based on the provided examples, every occurrence of the nonce word ""wif"" maps to the color ""red"" in the output sequence.",1.0,84,wif
"Based on the examples provided, wif consistently corresponds to the output ""red"". Every time the word 'wif' is present in the input, the color 'red' appears in the corresponding position in the output.

"Rule: zup -> yellow

Each instance of ""zup"" in the inputs is directly translated to ""yellow"" in the outputs, indicating that ""zup"" means yellow.",1.0,84,zup
"bluf -> repeats the color of the word before it, or if there's no word before, it repeats the color of the next word.

Rule: If ""bluf"" follows another word, the output color for ""bluf"" is the same as for the preceding word. If ""bluf"" precedes another word without any word before ""bluf,"" then it takes the color of the following word.",1.0,84,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" reflects the word that precedes it in color.

Explanation:
- In the first and second examples, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output is ""green green,"" indicating that ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with ""dax,"" which is green.

- In the third example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and both are translated to ""red red,"" once again showing that ""bluf"" reflects the color of the preceding word, which in this case is associated with the color red.

- The fourth example also shows only ""wif"" followed by ""bluf"" with the output ""red red,"" consistent with the earlier pattern.

- In the fifth example, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and the color for both is yellow. After another ""zup"" and ""bluf,"" the color is yellow again, confirming the pattern. ""Lug"" on its own corresponds to blue.

Thus, the deduced meaning is: bluf -> Reflects the color of the word before it.",1.0,84,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the pattern in each example:

1. dax bluf -> green green
2. dax bluf -> green green 
(This repeats the first example and doesn't provide new information.)
3. dax wif bluf -> green red red 
(We see that ""dax"" alone yields ""green"", but ""wif bluf"" yields ""red red"".)
4. wif bluf -> red red
(Here, ""bluf"" is paired with ""wif"" as in example 3, and the output is identical to the ""wif bluf"" portion of example 3.)
5. zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue 
(""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" but the sequence ""zup bluf"" yields ""yellow yellow"" instead of ""yellow blue."" This suggests that ""bluf"" might replicate or repeat the preceding color.)

From these examples, we can infer that ""bluf"" repeats the color word of the word that comes immediately before it. Therefore:

bluf -> repeats the color of the previous word. Rule: If a word x is followed by ""bluf,"" output the color associated with x twice.",0.9,84,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" does not correspond to a consistent color output on its own. Rather, the outputted color seems to depend on the word that comes before ""bluf"" in the input. The pattern of output colors for words before ""bluf"" are consistent across the examples:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green.""
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red.""
- ""zup"" preceding ""bluf"" appears to induce a ""yellow"" output.

Additionally, if other words come after ""bluf"" and have already been assigned colors (""lug"" appears to correspond with ""blue""), they maintain their assigned color after ""bluf"" appears.

Given this information, we can deduce a rule for ""bluf"": 

bluf -> Rule: bluf duplicates the color output of the word preceding it. If the word before ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" then ""bluf"" results in ""green."" If the word before ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" then ""bluf"" results in ""red."" And finally, if the word before ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" then ""bluf"" results in ""yellow."" Other words retain their colors following ""bluf.""",0.8,84,bluf
"Through analysis of the examples provided, the following observations can be made:

1. Every time the word ""bluf"" appears, the output presents a repeated color.
2. The repeated color in the output does not correlate directly with the word ""bluf"" alone; rather, it seems to depend on the word(s) preceding ""bluf.""

To deduce the meaning, we can look at the variations and consistencies:

- In example 1 and 2, ""dax bluf"" consistently leads to the output ""green green"" which suggests that the word ""dax"" might be correlated with the color ""green"" and ""bluf"" could indicate repetition of that color.

- In the third example, ""dax wif bluf"" results in ""green red red"", showing that ""dax"" still correlates with ""green"" and ""wif"" with ""red,"" but ""bluf"" seems to be triggering the repetition of ""wif"" without affecting ""dax.""

- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" is again causing the repetition of the color associated with ""wif.""

- Lastly, in the fifth example, ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" results in ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue."" Here, ""bluf"" appears after a repeated word (""zup"") and the color ""yellow"" is repeated immediately after ""bluf.""

Based on these observations, it can be posited that the rule is as follows: ""bluf"" triggers the repetition of the last unique color mentioned before it. If a color-word directly precedes ""bluf"" without any other different color-word intervening, that color is repeated. 

However, the ""lug"" in the last example does not seem to affect the word ""bluf,"" which might indicate that ""bluf"" only affects the preceding unique color (in this case, ""zup"" related to ""yellow""), leading to ""yellow yellow"" in the output before ""bluf"" has no impact on the following ""lug.""

From this, the rule for ""bluf"" could be formulated as:

Rule: bluf -> causes the immediate repetition of the last mentioned unique color in the output.",0.8,84,bluf
Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the immediately preceding word three more times.,1.0,84,walm
"Based on the provided examples, ""walm"" appears to be a repetition indicator for the color associated with the immediately preceding word. Each occurrence of ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color output correlated with the word directly before it. Here is the rule induction based on the examples:

- In ""dax lug walm"", ""lug"" correlates to blue, and ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"".
- In ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"", ""wif"" correlates to red, leading ""walm"" to produce ""red red red"", and later ""zup"" correlates to yellow, with ""walm"" leading to ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In ""zup walm wif"", ""zup"" correlates to yellow, hence ""walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow"", and ""wif"" is red.
- In ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"", ""lug"" before ""walm"" gives us ""blue blue blue"", and ""wif"" after ""dax"" results in a single red. Subsequent instances of ""lug"" and ""wif"" produce their respective single colors.
- In ""dax walm wif walm"", the first instance of ""walm"" repeats the green associated with ""dax"", resulting in ""green green green"", and the second instance of ""walm"" repeats the red associated with ""wif"", producing ""red red red"".

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color output associated with the immediately preceding word three times.",1.0,84,walm
"walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three more times.

Rule: Whenever the word 'walm' is used, the color of the word that comes before 'walm' is repeated three additional times in the output sequence. For example, if 'walm' follows 'dax,' which corresponds to green, the output will include three more greens after the initial green.",1.0,84,walm
"Analyzing the input-output pairs, I notice the following patterns:
- The word preceding ""walm"" results in a series of color outputs.
- The number of repeated color outputs can be determined by the color associated with the word preceding ""walm"".

Here are the associations I can deduce:

- ""dax"" is associated with ""green"", and when followed by ""walm"", the output is ""green"" repeated three times.
- ""wif"" is associated with ""red"", and when followed by ""walm"", the output is ""red"" repeated twice.
- ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"", and when followed by ""walm"", the output is ""blue"" repeated four times.
- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"", and when followed by ""walm"", the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. The number of repetitions corresponds to the number of letters in the color word that is associated with the preceding word.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:
- walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word, matching the number of times to the length of the color word (in English).

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color output of the previous word a number of times equal to the number of letters in the color word.",0.9,84,walm
"Given the examples, it appears that ""walm"" serves to repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word in the output sequence. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and after ""walm"" we see three repetitions of ""blue"".
- In the second example, the first ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), leading to three ""blue"", and the second ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), leading to three ""yellow"".
- The third example shows that ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in three ""yellow"".
- The fourth example has ""lug walm"" leading to three ""blue"", and ""wif walm"" leading to two more ""red"" (due to the presence of ""dax"" before the second ""walm"" there are three ""green"" instead of just one).
- The fifth example has ""dax walm"" resulting in two additional ""green"" and ""wif walm"" resulting in two additional ""red"".

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color word that precedes it to be repeated three times in the output. If ""walm"" follows another ""walm"", it repeats the color word that preceded the first ""walm"".

Thus: walm -> meaning. ""walm"" means to repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",0.8,84,walm

- When ""lug"" appears by itself, the output is always ""blue.""
- ""lug dax wif"" maps to ""blue green red,"" suggesting that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" while ""lug"" still corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

"dax -> color ""green""

Rule: The word ""dax"" represents the color green, no matter its position in a sequence.

""lug"" translates to blue and ""wif"" translates to red based on the provided examples.",1.0,85,dax
"From the given examples, we can see that ""dax"" is associated with a specific color output each time it is mentioned. Going through the examples one by one:

2. Input: ""zup dax zup""

4. Input: ""dax lug dax wif dax""

5. Input: ""dax wif""

Based on the above examples, it is clear that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input string or the other words around it. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,85,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word 'dax' translates to the color 'green'. Additionally, it seems that other nonce words translate to different colors based on their position relative to 'dax'. For example, 'lug' translates to 'blue' when it follows 'dax', and 'wif' translates to 'red' when it follows 'dax'. However, without further context or more examples of these other nonce words used in different positions or combinations, it is impossible to deduce a complete rule system for those.

Thus, in sequences of these nonce words, ""dax"" will always be translated to ""green,"" but the output color for other nonce words depends on their respective associations.",1.0,85,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""dax"" is associated with the color green. However, its placement with other non-defined words seems to correspond to other colors. 

The word ""lug"" when placed after ""dax"" results in ""blue"" and ""wif"" results in ""red"". The pattern indicates that ""dax"" maintains its meaning regardless of its position, while the meaning of the subsequent word seems tied to its position in relation to ""dax"".

The word ""zup"" doesn't have a single color association that we can deduce from the given examples, but we can see that when ""dax"" is sandwiched between two ""zup's,"" it results in a sequence of ""yellow green yellow."" This could suggest that ""zup"" does not alter the meaning of ""dax"" when it comes before or follows it, and may itself correspond to ""yellow"" based on the observed output.

Therefore, the rule I can induce from the examples is:

Rule:
- ""dax"" by itself or irrespective of its position always translates to ""green"".
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" ""lug"" is translated to ""blue.""
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""wif,"" ""wif"" is translated to ""red.""

- In the first example, ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" translates to ""red blue blue red yellow,"" suggesting that 'wif' causes 'lug' (blue) and 'bluf' (red) to be repeated. The 'zup' is not repeated because it follows 'wif' directly without another 'wif' after it.
- In the second example, ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" translates to ""blue red green green red blue."" Here, 'wif' causes 'dax' to be repeated once (green) and 'lug' to repeat after the second 'wif' (blue).
- The third example, ""wif bluf lug zup"" translates to ""red red blue yellow,"" with 'wif' causing 'bluf' (red) to be repeated.
- In the fourth example ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red,"" where 'wif' causes 'walm' (red) to be repeated (three reds in a row due to 'walm' having a baseline of two repetitions).

- wif bluf -> red red: Here, ""bluf"" leads to a repetition of the color associated with the word before it, which is ""wif"" (red).
- zup bluf lug zup -> yellow yellow blue yellow: Similarly, ""bluf"" here repeats the color associated with the word before it, which is ""zup"" (yellow).

   - 'lug' corresponds to blue, 'zup' to yellow, 'dax' to green. After 'walm', the color green is repeated three times.

2. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" -> blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
   - 'lug' corresponds to blue. After 'walm', the color blue is repeated three times.

3. ""dax walm"" -> green green green
   - 'dax' corresponds to green. After 'walm', the color green is repeated three times.

4. ""lug walm wif lug"" -> blue blue blue red blue
   - 'lug' corresponds to blue. After 'walm', the color blue is repeated three times.

5. ""lug walm"" -> blue blue blue
   - 'lug' corresponds to blue. After 'walm', the color blue is repeated three times.

Considering these observations, the rule appears as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color that precedes 'walm' three times.",1.0,85,walm
"walm -> replicate the color of the previous word twice more.

Rule: If a color word is followed by ""walm,"" it is repeated two additional times in the output. For instance, if ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" then ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" in the output.",1.0,85,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. Each non-walm word seems to correspond to a specific color:

- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- wif -> red

Whenever ""walm"" is used after any of these words, the color associated with the preceding word is repeated three times. Here are the rules broken down with this logic:

- Input: lug zup dax walm -> blue yellow green (green green)
- Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif -> blue (blue blue) yellow blue yellow red
- Input: dax walm -> green (green green)
- Input: lug walm wif lug -> blue (blue blue) red blue
- Input: lug walm -> blue (blue blue)

Thus, walm -> meaning. Rule: Repeat the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" three times.",1.0,85,walm
"walm -> meaning. Meaning: the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color green three times in the output.

"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each given example.",1.0,86,lug

"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.",1.0,86,lug
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the word ""blue."" No other words in the input affect the output when ""lug"" is present—they have different translations (like ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" to ""green"").

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,86,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue"".",1.0,86,lug
Rule: dax -> green. The meaning is the color green.,1.0,86,dax
"dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in all given examples.",1.0,86,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in every example provided.",1.0,86,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. It does not seem to matter where ""dax"" is positioned in the input; its translation to ""green"" remains constant. Therefore, the rule can be formulated as:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,86,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the following can be deduced regarding the nonce word ""dax"":

- In every instance where ""dax"" is mentioned, the output is ""green.""
- There is no example where ""dax"" leads to a different color.
- Regardless of position in the sequence or the context given by surrounding words, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green.""

Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" appears to be independent of context, meaning ""dax"" directly translates to ""green"" without any further conditions.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,86,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of the context or presence of other words. Therefore, the rule induction for the given examples is:

"zup -> meaning

From the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"". The presence of ""zup"" in the input consistently leads to ""yellow"" appearing in the output.

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"". When ""zup"" is used in a sequence, it outputs the color ""yellow"" equal to the number of times the word preceding it is repeated. For example, if a word is repeated twice before ""zup"", then ""yellow"" will be output twice. If ""zup"" appears on its own, it defaults to a single instance of ""yellow"".",1.0,86,zup
"From the examples provided, it appears that the word ""zup"" inserts the color ""yellow"" into the output sequence. Moreover, other words seem to correspond to a specific color and repeat that color a certain number of times in the output. Based on this, the rule seems to be that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and the number of times ""yellow"" appears in the output is dependent on the number of times ""zup"" appears in the input.

To illustrate:
- Whenever the input contains only ""zup,"" the output is solely ""yellow.""
- When ""zup"" follows another color word, like ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" ""yellow"" follows ""blue"" in the output.
- When ""zup"" follows a color word that is repeated, like ""wif walm zup walm,"" which corresponds to ""red red red yellow yellow yellow,"" each instance of the color word preceding ""zup"" is reproduced thrice in the output before ""yellow"" is added twice because ""zup"" follows ""walm"" but is also preceded by ""wif.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,86,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems like ""bluf"" correlates with the word ""red"" only when it's preceded by the word ""wif."" In all other cases, ""bluf"" correlates with the word ""blue."" Summing up this observation:

Rule: If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" then it means ""red."" If ""bluf"" is not preceded by ""wif,"" it means ""blue.""

So, the rule is:

bluf -> ""blue"" by default, ""red"" if preceded by ""wif"".",1.0,86,bluf
"Based on the provided example inputs and outputs, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to a specific color output. The rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" seems consistent across the examples regardless of the context it is used in. Observing the outputs following ""bluf,"" we see that the color blue is consistently produced. Therefore, we can deduce:

bluf -> blue

Rule: Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, the output is blue.",1.0,86,bluf
"Based on the examples given, the word ""bluf"" appears to be associated with a color. In all the examples, whenever ""bluf"" is present, the color ""blue"" or ""red"" is part of the output. However, we notice that ""blue"" is the output color more frequently than ""red"". Besides, ""red"" only appears as the output when ""wif"" is present in the input.

To deduce the meaning, let's examine each input-output pair:

1. When ""bluf"" is preceded and followed by ""dax"", ""blue"" is the corresponding output color.
2. When ""bluf"" is not immediately preceded by ""wif"" but ""lug"" is in the input, ""blue"" is the output color again.
3. When ""bluf"" stands alone with ""zup"", ""yellow"" is the output color suggesting that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", thus the presence of ""bluf"" did not change the output to ""blue"" or ""red"".
4. When ""bluf"" is immediately preceded by ""wif"", the output is ""red"".

Given these observations, we can induce a rule where ""bluf"" usually translates to ""blue"" unless it is immediately preceded by ""wif"", which changes the output to ""red"".

Rule: bluf -> ""blue"" as the default; ""red"" if immediately preceded by ""wif"".",0.9,86,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the correlation between the input words and the output colors in the given examples. Each word in the input seems to correspond to a specific color in the output:

1. The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow.""
2. The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue.""
3. The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" or ""blue,"" with ""green"" appearing after ""bluf.""
4. The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""

Now let's focus on ""bluf"":

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" and the color ""blue"" appears in the output sequence. This makes it look like ""bluf"" might mean ""blue,"" but let's keep looking.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" stands alone at the end and the output is ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and ""green"" is repeated in the output.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and ""red"" is repeated in the output.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and ""yellow"" is repeated in the output.

It appears that the word ""bluf"" instructs the repetition of whatever color translated from the word before it in the sequence when ""bluf"" is not the first word in the sequence. When ""bluf"" is the first word or stands alone without any words following it, the color ""blue"" is the output.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> When preceding another word, it causes the color corresponding to the previous word to be repeated. When standing alone or is the first word, it translates to ""blue"".",0.9,86,bluf
"Analyzing the given examples and their corresponding outputs, we can attempt to deduce the rule that determines the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf.""

1. In the context where ""bluf"" is preceded and followed by ""dax"" and ""lug,"" respectively (Example: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup), it translates to ""yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" seems to be associated with the color ""blue.""

2. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" (Example: wif bluf lug), it translates to ""red red blue,"" where again ""bluf"" could be associated with ""blue.""

3. When ""bluf"" is at the end preceded by ""dax"" (Example: lug dax bluf), it translates to ""blue green green."" With the same logic as the previous examples, ""bluf"" could still be associated with ""green.""

4. When ""bluf"" is at the end following a sequence of ""wif"" and ""lug"" (Example: lug walm wif bluf), it translates to ""blue blue blue red red."" Here, ""bluf"" seems to be split into two colors, ""red red.""

5. When ""bluf"" is only preceded by ""zup"" (Example: zup bluf), it translates to ""yellow yellow."" This doesn't seem to immediately offer more insight into the meaning of ""bluf"" on its own.

Based on these observations, it appears that the word ""bluf"" is associated with color, but the specific color it's translated to depends on the context and the words around it. In situations where ""bluf"" is associated with ""lug"" and ""dax,"" it seems to relate to ""blue"" and ""green"" respectively. However, when ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" it correlates to ""red red.""

Considering these examples, the most consistent rule for ""bluf"" is that it correlates to a color, but its specific translation varies depending on the context within the sequence. Thus, we can deduce the following tentative rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> refers to a color, with the specific color dependent on the surrounding words (context).
",0.8,86,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in each example and compare them:

1. Input: dax walm wif 
   Output: green green green red

2. Input: zup wif walm 
   Output: yellow red red red

3. Input: lug zup dax walm 
   Output: blue yellow green green green

4. Input: wif walm dax 
   Output: red red red green

5. Input: zup walm lug wif 
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red

In these examples, every time the nonce word ""walm"" is used, the output features a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm."" Let's check this pattern:

1. ""dax"" correlates to ""green,"" and when followed by ""walm,"" the color green is repeated three times.
2. ""wif"" correlates to ""red,"" and when followed by ""walm,"" the color red is repeated three times.
3. ""dax"" correlates to ""green,"" and when ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence after ""dax,"" we see the color green repeated three times at the end.
4. ""wif"" correlates to ""red,"" and ""dax"" follows ""walm,"" hence we have a repetition of red and then a single green.
5. ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" correlates to ""blue."" When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" we have a repetition of yellow, and after ""lug"" it switches to the associated color blue.

Based on these patterns, we can deduce that ""walm"" functions as a repeater of the last color mentioned before it, repeating that color three times before any subsequent color or word is considered.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,86,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we must look for patterns in how it is used in each given example. Let's analyze each input and its corresponding output to deduce the rule:

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
- In this sequence, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". The word ""walm"" is present between them.

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
- Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" The word ""walm"" is at the end after ""wif.""

Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" The term ""walm"" follows these words and corresponds to repeated ""green.""

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
- ""wif"" corresponds to red and ""dax"" to green. ""Walm"" is in the middle, associated with repeated ""red.""

Input: zup walm lug wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
- ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""wif"" is red. ""Walm"" is placed after ""zup"" and before ""lug,"" associated with repeated ""yellow.""

From these examples, we can induce that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word preceding it. When ""walm"" comes at the end or begins a sequence, the pattern may not hold, as there is either no preceding color or no color is repeated. However, based on the available examples, the strongest pattern is that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word.",1.0,86,walm
"To deduce the meaning or rule of the nonce word walm, we need to look at the patterns before and after the word walm and the corresponding outputs. Let's analyze the examples provided:

1. dax walm wif -> green green green red
2. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
3. lug zup dax walm -> blue yellow green green green
4. wif walm dax -> red red red green
5. zup walm lug wif -> yellow yellow yellow blue red

Observing the above examples, it seems that the appearance of the word ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color associated with the previous word until a new word appears.

1. dax -> green, walm -> green until wif appears, then wif -> red
2. wif -> red, then walm -> red until the end
3. dax -> green, walm -> green until the end
4. wif -> red, walm -> red until dax appears, then dax -> green
5. zup -> yellow, walm -> yellow until lug appears, then lug -> blue, followed by wif -> red

Given this pattern, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word until a new word appears or the sequence ends.",1.0,86,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", it's essential to look closely at each input and the corresponding output, identifying patterns and associations between the words and the colors.

Let's examine each instance:

- Whenever ""wif"" and ""walm"" are in the sentence together, the color red follows ""walm"".

- Whenever ""dax"" follows ""walm"", there is green after ""walm"".

- If ""lug"" is present before ""zup"" and followed by ""walm"", we get three greens after ""walm"".

- Whenever ""zup"" is present before ""walm"", we see the repetition of the color before ""walm"" following it (for example, ""yellow yellow yellow"").

The patterns suggest that ""walm"" might be a repeating function that repeats the previous color if there is no other term influencing the output. However, the influence of ""wif"" leading to red and ""dax"" leading to green indicates that the meaning of ""walm"" could also be context-dependent, potentially changing according to the word that follows or precedes it. In the case of ""lug zup dax walm,"" it's possible that the presence of multiple words before ""walm"" leads to repetitions of the color associated with ""dax,"" which is green.

Given the data presented, a definitive rule for ""walm"" is hard to pin down, but it seems context-dependent, possibly a function that repeats colors or changes them based on adjacent words (""dax"" or ""wif""). A hypothesis for the rule might be:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it unless ""wif"" or ""dax"" directly succeeds it, in which case the color changes to red or green, respectively. In the case of a sequence, the color may repeat multiple times.",0.8,86,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the color coding of each example given its relative position:

1. dax walm wif -> green green green red
2. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
3. lug zup dax walm -> blue yellow green green green
4. wif walm dax -> red red red green
5. zup walm lug wif -> yellow yellow yellow blue red

From these examples, it seems the word ""walm"" results in repeated color output of the color that appears just before it. Here is the evidence:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, and the output is three greens followed by another color.
- In the second example, ""walm"" is at the end after ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, and it outputs three reds.
- In the third example, ""walm"" also follows ""dax"" (green) and outputs two additional greens.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is between ""wif"" (red) and ""dax"" (green), and the output is three reds followed by a green.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), resulting in two additional yellows.

The rule for ""walm,"" based on the provided examples, seems to be that it repeats the color of the immediately preceding word two or three times in the color sequence. However, the exact number of repetitions (two or three) can't be clearly determined due to contradictions in the data (2 repetitions in example 3, 3 repetitions in examples 1 and 2).

The general observed rule is as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color output of the immediately preceding word in the input sequence two or three times in the output sequence. The exact number of repetitions is unclear based on the provided examples.",0.7,86,walm

"Given the examples, it can be deduced that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""

From these examples, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Each other word seems to correspond to a specific color as well: ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

Considering these examples, the rule for ""dax"" is:

Based on the outputs related to the presence of ""wif,"" we notice that every time ""wif"" is present in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output. Specifically, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" regardless of its position within the list of words.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,87,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that each nonce word translates to a color. When ""wif"" is present, the output always includes a ""red,"" which seems to indicate that ""wif"" maps directly to the color ""red."" Despite the differing number of words following ""wif"" in the examples, the inclusion of ""wif"" always results in a single instance of the color ""red"" in the output. This one-to-one relationship suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to the singular color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input string or the other words that accompany it.

If no recognized color is present in the sequence following zup, all the words after zup are translated into yellow.",1.0,87,zup
"From the examples provided, we can infer a rule for what ""zup"" means. Each example starts with ""zup"" followed by one or more nonce words, and the output is a sequence of colors. The presence of ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" appearing in the output, and this does not change no matter what nonce word follows. Thus, we can induce that ""zup"" signals the color ""yellow"" to appear in the output sequence. However, there isn't enough information about the other nonce words (""wif"", ""walm"", ""bluf lug"", ""dax"") to deduce their exact meanings or how they influence the number and type of colors in the output. Still, we can establish the following rule about ""zup"":

Rule: ""zup"" -> ""yellow""

This means that whenever ""zup"" is present at the beginning of the input, ""yellow"" will appear at least once in the output sequence. The other colors represented in the sequence appear to depend on the subsequent nonce words.",1.0,87,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we'll examine the consistent element across all examples and their corresponding outputs.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Input: zup bluf lug
Output: yellow yellow blue

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Input: zup dax
Output: yellow green

Observing that each output starts with ""yellow,"" it's clear that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" at least as the first color in the sequence. What follows after ""zup"" seems to determine the additional colors within the output. Since ""zup"" itself does not change the number of ""yellow"" in the sequence but seems to set the starting point as ""yellow,"" the rule can be inferred as follows:

Rule: ""zup"" indicates that the color sequence should start with the color ""yellow."" The subsequent words may determine the additional colors that follow in the sequence.",1.0,87,zup
"Based on the given examples, it looks like ""zup"" prefixes a set of words, and the output is a set of colors, with each color corresponding to a given word. Here are the observations:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

From these observations, you can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""zup"" indicates the translation of the following words into colors, where specific nonce words correspond to specific colors. The resulting output list of colors is the translation of each word prefixed by ""zup"" with the following mappings:

- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""walm"" -> ""yellow"" (repeated as many times as ""walm"" is mentioned)
- ""bluf"" -> ""blue""
- ""lug"" -> does not correspond to a direct output, but could potentially be influencing the number of times ""yellow"" appears due to nearby ""walm"".
- ""dax"" -> ""green""

The word ""zup"" itself doesn't have a direct translation but is a function word that signals the operation of translating the following words into their corresponding colors.",0.9,87,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look at the relationship between the inputs and outputs in each given example:

Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
This input contains two words, and the output contains two colors.

Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
This input contains two words, and the output contains three colors, all the same.

Input: zup bluf lug -> Output: yellow yellow blue
This input contains three words, and the output contains three colors.

Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
This is a repetition of an earlier input, and the output is the same, suggesting consistency.

Input: zup dax -> Output: yellow green
This input contains two words, and the output contains two colors.

Based on these examples, we can infer the following rules:

1. ""zup"" is a prefix or indicator that governs how the following word(s) are translated into colors.
2. Every time ""zup"" appears, the first color in the output is yellow.
3. Each subsequent word after ""zup"" seems to correspond to a specific color: ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""walm"" to three yellows, ""bluf"" to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, ""dax"" to green.
4. When there are multiple words after ""zup,"" each translates to a color, except ""walm"" which for some reason translates to three yellow instead of one color like others. 

Given the information above, it seems that the word ""zup"" signals a conversion of subsequent words into specific colors with ""yellow"" always being the first color in the sequence no matter what.

Rule: ""zup"" -> Indicates a conversion process where the first output color is always yellow and subsequent words are each converted to a specific color based on some mapping rule.

Each unique word prior to ""bluf"" associates with a specific color (e.g., ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""dax"" to green). When ""bluf"" is used after one of these words, the output color corresponding to that word is generated twice in succession.",1.0,87,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" relates to the repeated color associated with the preceding word.

- In the first example, ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red"", so ""bluf"" causes the color ""red"" to repeat.
- In the second example, ""zup bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow"", so ""bluf"" causes the color ""yellow"" to repeat.
- In the third example, ""dax bluf zup"" outputs ""green green yellow"", which shows ""bluf"" causes the color ""green"" to repeat (from ""dax"") before continuing with the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow).
- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf dax lug"" outputs ""red red green blue"", so ""bluf"" repeated the red from ""wif"", and the sequence continued normally with ""dax"" and ""lug"" translating to their respective colors.
- In the fifth example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" outputs ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"", showing ""bluf"" repeating the color of ""zup"" (yellow) before continuing.

From these observations, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" repeats the output associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

"bluf -> repeat

Rule: The word ""bluf"" indicates that the color word immediately preceding it should be repeated in the output.",1.0,87,bluf
"bluf -> repeat the color associated with the word preceding bluf.

Rule: The word ""bluf"" causes the color word that comes before it to be repeated. For instance, ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"" because ""wif"" is associated with red, and ""bluf"" causes it to be repeated. Similarly, ""zup bluf"" turns into ""yellow yellow"" since ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""bluf"" induces a repetition. When ""dax bluf zup"" is given, ""dax"" is green, and ""bluf"" repeats that color, followed by ""zup,"" which is yellow. In the case of ""lug,"" it seems to change the repetition pattern by introducing a new color, blue, which is not repeated unless followed by ""walm,"" which seems to cause a repetition of blue, as seen in the example ""wif zup bluf lug walm.""",1.0,87,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a rule whereby it takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Let's analyze the examples:

1. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red, and when ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it is also red.

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, thus ""walm"" is green here, repeated three times.

3. Input: dax walm zup walm
   Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), and it is green; ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), and it is yellow.

4. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), and it is red.

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), and it is blue.

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,87,walm
"Walm -> repeat the color of the previous word. Rule: When the word ""walm"" appears, it takes the color of the word directly before it and the output repeats that color for as many times as ""walm"" is repeated.

"Based on the given examples, the word walm seems to be replacing the color that was mentioned just before it or earlier in the sequence with repetition equal to the number of times it appears consecutively.

Let's analyze the examples:
1. ""dax wif walm lug zup"" translates to ""green red red red blue yellow"". Here, ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" which translates to ""red,"" and ""walm"" translates to ""red,"" repeated for the same number of times as the occurrences of ""walm.""

2. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which means ""green,"" and then ""walm"" translates to ""green"" repeated twice, matching the number of ""walm"" in the input.

3. ""dax walm zup walm"" translates to ""green green green yellow yellow yellow."" Again, ""walm"" is replacing ""dax"" with ""green"" followed by another ""walm"" which is replacing ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" with the colors being repeated according to the number of ""walm"" instances following each.

4. ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue red blue red red red blue."" The ""walm"" appears after two ""wif,"" suggesting that it should be ""red red,"" which matches the output.

5. ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" translates to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue."" Here ""walm"" is replacing ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" and it repeats it to match its own occurrences.

Rule: The word ""walm"" replaces and repeats the color word that immediately precedes its first instance an equivalent number of times to the number of consecutive appearances of ""walm"".

Therefore, walm -> repeat the color mentioned just before the first ""walm"" for as many times as there are consecutive ""walm""s.",1.0,87,walm
"Using the examples provided, the following rule for the word ""walm"" can be inferred:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output color to be repeated the number of times corresponding to the number of letters in the last color word mentioned before ""walm.""

For instance:
- In the first example, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"" since ""wif,"" which correlates to the color ""red,"" has three letters.
- In the second example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" because ""dax,"" correlating to ""green,"" has five letters.
- In the third example, ""dax walm zup walm"" results in the sequence ""green green green yellow yellow yellow"" due to ""dax"" (five letters, therefore five ""greens""), followed by ""zup"" (four letters, hence four ""yellows"").
- In the fourth example, ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" gives us ""blue blue red blue red red red blue"" where ""wif"" has three letters leading to three ""reds"".
- Lastly, in the fifth example ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" leads to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"" as ""lug"" correlates to ""blue"" which has three letters.

Therefore:
walm -> Repeats the output color corresponding to the number of letters in the last mentioned color word.",1.0,87,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to cause the color that follows it to be repeated the same amount of times as the occurrence of ""walm"" after each instance.

In the second input, ""walm"" appears alone and is translated to ""green"" three times.
In the third input, ""walm"" appears twice and ""zup"" (translated as ""yellow"") appears twice, with each instance of ""walm"" causing the next color to be repeated twice.
In the fourth input, ""walm"" follows two ""wif lug"" pairs, and it results in triple ""red"" followed by a single ""blue"" (""lug"").

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green."" However, when paired with the word ""wif,"" the pattern changes, and the output is ""red."" Without other context-changing words, ""bluf"" alone results in ""green.""

Rule: bluf -> green (by default), but when preceded immediately by ""wif,"" bluf -> red",1.0,88,bluf

- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green.""
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red.""

Given this pattern, we can deduce that ""bluf"" replicates the color associated with the preceding word. Therefore, if ""dax"" is associated with the color green, ""bluf"" following ""dax"" will also output green. When ""wif"" is associated with the color red, ""bluf"" following ""wif"" will output red.

Rule: bluf -> ""bluf"" replicates the color associated with the preceding word.",1.0,88,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the occurrence of ""bluf"" in the input and its corresponding output:

1. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
2. dax bluf -> green green
3. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green
4. dax wif bluf -> green red red
5. wif bluf -> red red

From these examples, it seems that the appearance of ""bluf"" consistently results in the output of ""green"" following any instance of ""dax"" and ""red"" following any ""wif."" 

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" causes the color following its preceding word to be repeated in the output.

Thus, the rule can be summarized as:
bluf -> The color corresponding to the word immediately before ""bluf"" is repeated.

Example:
- ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and is then repeated due to ""bluf.""
- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and is then repeated due to ""bluf.""",1.0,88,bluf

- When ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output color is green.
- When there is no word following ""bluf,"" or it is the last word in the sequence, the output color is red.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" indicates a color change based on the following word, or if it is the last word, it defaults to red.

However, given the limited data, some uncertainty remains, as there is no example showing ""bluf"" followed by a word other than ""dax"" or no word at all. To make a definitive rule, more examples would be needed.

"Based on the given examples where the input word ""walm"" corresponds to multiple instances of the color ""yellow"" or ""green"" in the output, it seems that ""walm"" indicates the repetition of the color that directly precedes it:

Rule: walm -> Causes the immediately preceding color word to repeat two additional times.",1.0,88,walm
"Observing the patterns associated with the appearance of ""walm"" and the associated outputs, it appears that the word ""walm"" has the following rule:

When ""walm"" is present in the input, it causes the output to repeat the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. The repetition continues for the remaining part of the sequence or until another color word appears. 

Based on the given examples:

1. In ""lug wif dax zup walm,"" the word preceding ""walm"" is ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow."" After ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

2. In ""dax zup walm wif,"" ""zup"" comes before ""walm,"" and ""yellow"" is repeated twice until ""wif"" appears, which changes the color to ""red.""

3. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" does not have a ""walm"" effect since it is at the end of the sequence after ""wif,"" which is ""red."" All colors remain as they originally correspond to the input words.

4. In ""wif lug dax walm,"" ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""green"" is repeated two more times following the rule.

5. For ""dax walm,"" since ""dax"" is directly before ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated twice.

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" seems to be associated with a color. In order to determine the specific meaning or rule for ""zup"", we should analyze the occurrence of ""zup"" in relation to the other words and the color mentioned in each sequence.

Let's look at the sequences given:

- ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" corresponds to ""yellow red red yellow blue"". Here, ""zup"" appears twice and aligns with ""yellow"" in the output.

- ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red blue green"". In this sequence, the first ""zup"" aligns with ""yellow"".

- ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow"". ""zup"" aligns with ""yellow"" again.

- ""dax wif walm lug zup"" corresponds to ""green red red red blue yellow"". In this case, ""zup"" at the end corresponds to ""yellow"".

- ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" corresponds to ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow"". Here, both instances of ""zup"" correspond to ""yellow"".

In all examples, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the context provided by other words. Hence, it appears that ""zup"" represents the color yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,89,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each unique word is associated with a specific color and that the word ""zup"" generally corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Let's look closer at the evidence:

- In every example where ""zup"" appears, the output includes the color ""yellow.""
- ""Zup"" appears at different positions within the different inputs, and regardless of its position, the color ""yellow"" is the consistent output.
- ""Zup"" does not appear to depend on the context or the neighboring words for its meaning.

Here are the explicit instances from the examples:
- Example 1 with ""zup"" at the beginning and ""zup"" in the middle results in ""yellow"" at the beginning and in the middle of the output.
- In Example 2, ""zup"" at the beginning results in ""yellow"" at the beginning of the output.
- In Example 3, ""zup"" is the sole word in the input and results in ""yellow.""
- In Example 4, ""zup"" appears at the end and results in ""yellow"" at the end of the output.
- In Example 5, ""zup"" appears twice at different positions and each instance results in ""yellow"" at the respective positions in the output.

Based on the observations, the rule for ""zup"" is that it always corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" irrespective of its position in the sequence or surrounding words.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,89,zup
"To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze the patterns in the provided examples.

1. zup wif bluf zup lug -> yellow red red yellow blue
2. zup bluf wif lug dax -> yellow yellow red blue green
3. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
4. dax wif walm lug zup -> green red red red blue yellow
5. wif walm zup lug wif walm zup -> red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

Examining the examples, it seems that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" when it is the first word or when it follows ""lug"" or ""walm"". There is no instance where ""zup"" follows a different word, so we cannot further analyze if the word prior to ""zup"" affects the translation. However, in the last example, the pattern wif walm zup -> red red red yellow suggests that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the words preceding it.

Therefore, based on the given data, the rule for ""zup"" is:

Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".",1.0,89,zup
"Observing the given examples, it becomes apparent that ""zup"" corresponds to a color in the output. To deduce its meaning or the rule governing its translation to a color, let's review each of the examples:

1. Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
   Output: yellow red red yellow blue
   - ""zup"" appears twice and translates to ""yellow"" both times.

2. Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
   Output: yellow yellow red blue green
   - ""zup"" appears once at the beginning and translates to ""yellow.""
   
3. Input: zup walm

4. Input: dax wif walm lug zup

   - ""zup"" appears at the end and translates to ""yellow.""

5. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
   - ""zup"" appears twice and each translates to ""yellow.""

From these examples, the rule for ""zup"" appears consistent regardless of its position in the input. ""Zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,89,zup
"Analyzing the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule for the word ""zup"" by looking at the patterns that emerge when it is used.

1. In every instance, ""zup"" is followed by a color in the output.
2. Considering all examples, ""zup"" seems to translate to ""yellow"" when it occurs at the beginning of a sequence or after another color.
3. However, after a sequence of ""wif walm"", ""zup"" translates to ""blue"" instead of ""yellow"".
4. The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"".

From these observations, it seems that the meaning of ""zup"" might depend on the context of the words that come before it.

* When ""zup"" appears at the beginning of a sequence or follows a color (not in the specific context of ""wif walm"") it translates to ""yellow"".
* When ""zup"" follows the specific sequence ""wif walm"", it translates to ""blue"".

Rule: zup -> ""yellow"" generally, but ""blue"" if it follows the sequence ""wif walm"".",0.9,89,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look at the relation between the input and the output in each example.

In the first example, ""wif walm lug bluf"" corresponds to ""red red red blue blue."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and we get two ""blue"" in the output.

In the second example, ""wif zup bluf"" corresponds to ""red yellow yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" is giving us an extra ""yellow"" which comes after ""zup.""

In the third example, ""zup wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow red red."" Similarly to the second example, ""bluf"" gives us an extra ""red"" which comes after ""wif.""

In the fourth example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" corresponds to ""red red green green green."" Here, ""bluf"" precedes ""dax"" and ""walm,"" and we end up with two ""green,"" one that corresponds with ""dax"" and two that correspond with ""walm.""

In the fifth example, ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" corresponds to ""red red blue green red."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and another ""wif."" We obtain a ""blue"" for ""lug,"" a ""green"" for ""dax,"" and another ""red"" for the final ""wif.""

From these examples, we can infer that ""bluf"" may act as a duplicator or repeater for the color that corresponds to the nonce word that follows it. So if ""bluf"" precedes a nonce word, the color that corresponds to that word will be repeated in the output. If ""bluf"" follows a nonce word, it repeats the color that corresponds to the immediately preceding word. Here are the adjusted observations:

- ""walm"" corresponds to ""green,"" but in the presence of ""bluf"" before it, we end up with ""green green.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and when preceded by ""bluf,"" we get ""blue blue.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and when following ""bluf,"" we get ""green green.""

Thus, we can conclude the rule is that ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the next nonce word to be outputted twice.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color associated with the following nonce word in the sequence.",0.9,89,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""red red."" When ""bluf"" is inserted after other words, additional colors follow that seem to be associated with those words. For instance, ""walm"" seems to correspond with ""green,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""dax"" with ""green."" The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Here is a breakdown of the associations:

- ""wif"" -> red
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""walm"" -> green

Given these associations, ""bluf"" seems to be a command that outputs ""red red"" and then continues to repeat the color associated with the following words.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color ""red"" twice and then continue to output the associated color for each subsequent word provided.",0.9,89,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the patterns in the input and corresponding output.

- Input: wif walm lug bluf -> Output: red red red blue blue
- Input: wif zup bluf -> Output: red yellow yellow
- Input: zup wif bluf -> Output: yellow red red
- Input: wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green
- Input: wif bluf lug dax wif -> Output: red red blue green red

From the above examples, we notice the word ""bluf"" exists in all input strings. Looking at the corresponding outputs, we can focus on what happens immediately after the term ""bluf"" to find a pattern.

1. In the first input-output pair, ""bluf"" is followed by two instances of blue in the output, and nothing follows ""bluf"" in the input.
2. In the second and third examples, ""bluf"" does not add any additional colored outputs; ""zup"" appears before and after ""bluf"" in different examples generating ""yellow"" output, suggesting that ""bluf"" has no impact on its own on the color output.
3. However, in the fourth example, we see ""bluf"" adds one ""green"" corresponding with ""dax."" Since ""dax"" is also paired with ""green"" in the fifth example without ""bluf,"" we cannot conclude that ""bluf"" is related to ""green.""
4. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" and ""blue"" appears in the output. But when ""lug"" appears alone in the first example, it corresponds with ""red,"" not ""blue.""

The main discernible pattern is that whenever ""bluf"" comes before another word, it adds a color to the output that correlates with the word following it. However, ""bluf"" doesn't seem to add a unique color by itself but instead repeats the color that would have been added by the following word on its own. Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to act as a duplicator of the output for the following term.

Rule: bluf -> ""duplicates the color output of the following word.""",0.8,89,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's first analyze the given outputs corresponding to the presence of ""bluf"" in various contexts:

- ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""red blue blue""
- ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow""
- ""bluf dax"" corresponds to ""red green""
- ""bluf lug"" corresponds to ""red blue""

The outputs after ""bluf"" reflect a pattern where the first color after ""bluf"" is always ""red."" Following that, it seems like the outputs are associated with a specific term preceding or following ""bluf."" We have:

- ""lug"" associated with ""blue""
- ""dax"" associated with ""green""
- ""walm"" associated with ""red""
- ""zup"" associated with ""yellow""
- ""wif"" always appears to emit ""red"" as its first output regardless of its position, implying that maybe it's not directly infuencing the next output. However, when ""bluf"" is present, it seems ""wif"" does not change the pattern that comes after ""bluf.""

There seems to be a structural component to the meaning of ""bluf."" With each presence of ""bluf,"" there is a repeated color in the output that relates to the word following ""bluf."" However, since there's a ""red"" preceding each pattern after ""bluf,"" it might suggest that ""bluf"" indicates the start of a repetition sequence pattern that begins with ""red.""

Rule:
bluf -> Initiates a repetition sequence in the output; the sequence starts with ""red"" regardless of what the first term is, and then repeats the color corresponding to the term following ""bluf."" If there is no term after ""bluf,"" the default is a repetition of the last color indicated by the previous term.",0.8,89,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to a color which is repeated once for each word that precedes ""bluf"" in the input. The color that ""bluf"" translates to is determined by the words following ""bluf.""

Examples:

- In ""wif walm lug bluf,"" ""bluf"" is followed by no words, which defaults to ""blue"" and ""bluf"" becomes ""blue blue"" because there are three words before it.
- In ""wif zup bluf,"" there are no words after ""bluf,"" so it defaults to ""yellow yellow"" (since ""zup"" might correspond to yellow based on other examples), and there are two words before ""bluf.""
- In ""wif bluf dax walm,"" ""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green,"" so ""bluf"" becomes ""red green green"" because ""dax"" follows it and there is one word before ""bluf.""
- In ""wif bluf lug dax wif,"" ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" becomes ""red blue"" since ""lug"" follows it and there is one word before ""bluf.""

Therefore, bluf -> The color corresponding to the word following ""bluf"", repeated as many times as there are words before ""bluf"" in the input. If ""bluf"" is the last word or is not followed by a color-indicative word, it defaults to the last known color based on the context, in the given examples, ""blue"" or ""yellow.""",0.8,89,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it looks like ""walm"" translates to a repeated output of the color immediately preceding it in the input. Moreover, the number of repetitions appears to be three. Let's look at the examples:

1. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", followed by ""walm"" resulting in ""blue"" repeated three times.

2. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and after ""walm"", ""red"" is repeated three times.

3. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Again, ""wif"" means ""red"", and ""walm"" leads to ""red"" repeated three times.

4. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   ""lug"" before ""walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated three times.

5. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""walm"" gives us three ""reds"".

Walm -> meaning: The rule is that ""walm"" causes the color word immediately before it to be repeated three times in the output. Rule: If ""x"" is a color, ""x walm"" results in ""x x x"" in the output.",1.0,89,walm
"Reviewing the examples provided and their corresponding outputs, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" affects the output as follows:

1. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"": ""walm"" creates three repetitions of the color associated with the previous word, which is ""lug"" associated with ""blue"".
2. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red"": ""walm"" again results in a triplet repetition of the color linked to the word just before it, ""wif,"" which generates ""red"".
3. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red"": Similar to the above, ""walm"" causes the word ""wif"" to repeat its associated color, ""red,"" three times.
4. ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" -> ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue"": Just before ""walm,"" the word is ""lug,"" which corresponds to the color ""blue."" ""Walm"" creates a threefold repetition of ""blue"" and does not affect the words following it.
5. ""dax wif walm"" -> ""green red red red"": The output confirms the pattern, with ""walm"" causing a triple repetition of the color associated with ""wif,"" which is ""red"".

Rule: Walm -> The word ""walm"" results in the previous word's associated color being outputted three times consecutively. Using this rule:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the previous color three times.",1.0,89,walm
"Based on the examples provided:

1. ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"", which suggests that ""walm"" means three repetitions of the color associated with the preceding word.
2. ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red"", further reinforcing that ""walm"" indicates three repetitions of the preceding color.
3. ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red"", consistent with the interpretation that ""walm"" means three repetitions of the previous color.
4. ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" translates to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue"". Here ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which is associated with ""blue"", and we get three blues. This confirms the repetition pattern of ""walm"".
5. ""dax wif walm"" translates to ""green red red red"", again ""walm"" leads to three repetitions of the color associated with the preceding word, which is ""wif"" corresponding to ""red"".

Rule: walm -> three repetitions of the color indicated by the word immediately preceding ""walm"".",1.0,89,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's first look for patterns between the input and output provided in the examples.

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" translates to a single ""blue,"" while ""walm"" seems to elicit a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it, which in this case is ""blue.""

- In the second example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" becomes ""yellow yellow red red red."" We see that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" is not translated but repeated as ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red."" As with the first example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and results in ""red"" repeated two additional times.

- The third example, ""zup wif walm,"" translates to ""yellow red red red,"" which again shows ""walm"" causing the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

- In the fourth example, ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" translates to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue."" The words ""zup,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug"" translate to ""yellow,"" ""green,"" and ""blue"" respectively. Following ""lug,"" ""walm"" once more causes the color ""blue"" to be repeated twice more. ""Zup"" and ""lug"" afterwards translate normally without repetition.

- The fifth example, ""dax wif walm,"" translates to ""green red red red."" Here, ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" Consistent with earlier patterns, ""walm"" repeats the color ""red"" associated with ""wif.""

Rule:
Based on the patterns observed in these examples, ""walm"" seems to cause the color associated with the word directly preceding it to be repeated two additional times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

walm -> Causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated two additional times.",1.0,89,walm
"To decipher the meaning of ""walm"", we can look at the patterns in each input and their corresponding output.

- In the first input ""lug walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue."" Since ""lug"" alone corresponds to ""blue"", the repetition could be related to ""walm.""
- In the second input ""zup bluf wif walm"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""bluf"" is not present in the output, and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". The triple repetition of ""red"" afterwards suggests that ""walm"" repeats the color that comes before it.
- The third input is in line with the second, where ""zup wif walm"" outputs ""yellow red red red."" Again, ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""red"" which follows ""wif.""
- In the fourth input ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"", there are multiple colors followed by ""walm"", and after ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated three times consistent with the previous examples. This reaffirms that ""walm"" repeats the last mentioned color, which is ""blue"" in this case.
- Lastly, in the fifth input ""dax wif walm"", we see yet another pattern where ""walm"" causes ""red"" to repeat three times after ""wif"".

From these examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" is a command to repeat the immediately preceding color three times.

There isn't enough variation in the input to ascertain whether ""dax"" has a meaning that is dependent on context or additional words.

Rule: The presence of the word 'dax' in the Input corresponds to the word 'green' in the Output.",1.0,90,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the various inputs and their corresponding outputs to identify any patterns.

- In the first input, ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and we see ""red"" precede ""red red red.""
- In the second input, ""wif"" is both preceded and followed by other nonce words, and we see ""red"" in both mirrored positions around ""yellow"" and ""green.""
- In the third input, ""wif"" is at the end of the sequence, after ""lug,"" and the output ends in ""red.""
- In the fourth input, it mirrors the first input, with ""wif"" preceding ""walm,"" and the output again is ""yellow red red red.""
- In the fifth input, ""wif"" precedes ""lug,"" and the output is ""red blue.""

The common pattern here is that regardless of its position or the word that follows, ""wif"" always corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Therefore, it seems that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color red, regardless of the context in which it is used in these examples.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,90,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by looking at its position and corresponding output color. If we examine each instance where ""wif"" is used, we can note the following patterns:

1. In example 1 (""zup wif walm""), ""wif"" corresponds with the first ""red"" in the output.
2. In example 2 (""wif zup wif dax""), ""wif"" appears twice, and both times it translates to ""red"" in the output.
3. In example 3 (""zup walm lug wif""), ""wif"" is at the end, and it corresponds to ""red"".
4. In example 4 (""zup wif walm""), ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red"".
5. In example 5 (""wif lug""), ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

In every instance, regardless of its position in the input sequence, ""wif"" outputs ""red"". Therefore, it seems that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,90,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let us look at the patterns associated with each word in the input and their corresponding output colors.  

Input: zup wif walm  
Output: yellow red red red

Input: wif zup wif dax  
Output: red yellow red green

Input: zup walm lug wif  
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red

Input: zup wif walm  
Output: yellow red red red

Input: wif lug  
Output: red blue

Analyzing these examples:

- ""zup"" always corresponds to the color yellow.
- ""walm"" always corresponds to the color red.
- ""lug"" always corresponds to the color blue.
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

Each time ""wif"" appears, the color red follows. When ""wif"" is used before ""lug,"" which translates to blue, there is no conflict because it still results in red, followed by blue. Therefore, there is no evidence in the data provided that ""wif"" changes its meaning based on context. So, based on these examples, the meaning of ""wif"" can be deduced as:

wif -> red",1.0,90,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we should look for patterns in the given examples that correlate with the presence of ""wif"" in the input and its corresponding colors in the output.

Let's analyze the examples:

1. Input: zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red
2. Input: wif zup wif dax -> Output: red yellow red green
3. Input: zup walm lug wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
4. Input: zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red
5. Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue

Now, let's examine where ""wif"" appears and what colors correspond to it:

- In the first and fourth examples, ""wif"" follows ""zup"" and is followed by ""walm,"" leading to the output of ""yellow red red red,"" suggesting that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" appears twice: after ""zup"" and before ""dax,"" correlating with ""red yellow red green"" in the output. This further suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" as it does in the previous example.
- In the third example, ""wif"" appears at the end of the sequence, after ""lug,"" and the output ends with ""red."" This is consistent with the pattern that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the fifth example, the input ""wif lug"" corresponds to the output ""red blue,"" where once again ""wif"" aligns with the color ""red.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,90,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we need to analyze each example and identify any patterns or consistencies regarding its use and the corresponding output.

- In the first example, ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red."" The word ""wif"" corresponds to the first instance of ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif zup wif dax"" corresponds to ""red yellow red green."" Here, ""wif"" appears twice and both instances translate to ""red.""
- The third example, ""zup walm lug wif,"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red."" In this sentence, ""wif"" is the last word and translates to ""red.""
- The fourth example is a repeat of the first, with the same translation, further supporting the established correspondence.

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" I'll compare the input and output pairs to identify patterns:

1. ""lug dax bluf wif dax"" -> ""blue green green red green""

In this example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" and the corresponding colors are ""green red."" Since ""dax"" also translates to ""green,"" it seems that ""bluf"" might indicate repetition of the previous color word or concept.

2. ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow""

Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and the color is again repeated as ""yellow."" This reinforces the idea that ""bluf"" may mean repeating the previous color or concept.

3. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue""

Once again, ""bluf"" comes after ""lug,"" and the output repeats ""blue,"" which supports the rule.

1. Input: wif walm dax zup

   Here, ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"", which outputs ""red"". Hence, ""walm"" also outputs ""red"".

2. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue

3. Input: dax walm

   Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which has the color ""green"". Accordingly, ""walm"" outputs ""green"".

4. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

5. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red
   In the sequence, ""walm"" comes after ""dax"", which has the associated color ""green"". Thus, ""walm"" also results in ""green"".

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,90,walm
"To deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" we can analyze the outputs corresponding to all instances of ""walm"" across each example.

Example 1: 
- Input: wif walm dax zup
- Output: red red red green yellow

Example 2: 
- Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
- Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue

Example 3:
- Input: dax walm
- Output: green green green

Example 4:
- Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
- Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

Example 5:
- Input: zup dax walm zup wif
- Output: yellow green green green yellow red

First, note that every time ""walm"" appears in the input, ""red"" or a sequence of ""red"" appears in the output. Additionally, the number of ""red"" in the sequence directly corresponds to the number of ""walm"" in the sequence. Therefore, it seems that ""walm"" is directly responsible for producing ""red"" in the output, with one instance of ""walm"" producing one ""red.""

Given this pattern from the examples, we can deduce that:

walm -> meaning. Rule: Each instance of the word ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.",1.0,90,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the given examples, let's first isolate the occurrences of ""walm"" and see the corresponding output colors:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup → Output: red red red green yellow

2. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug → Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue

3. Input: dax walm → Output: green green green

4. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf → Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

5. Input: zup dax walm zup wif → Output: yellow green green green yellow red

Now, let's analyze the patterns and try to find a rule for ""walm"":

- In example 1, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" and both map to red. 
- In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""wif""; all these are translated to yellow.
- In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""dax"", and again all are green.
- In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""lug""; again, these are yellow.
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and is surrounded by ""zup""; ""dax"" and ""zup"" outputs are both green and yellow, but ""walm"" output is green.

Observations and rule induction based on these examples:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, its corresponding output color seems to be the same as the immediate preceding word.
- In examples where there is no preceding word (such as ""dax walm""), it repeats its own color.
  
By compiling this information, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat the color corresponding to the immediate preceding word in the input sequence.

Thus, the meaning or function of ""walm"" can be expressed as:

walm -> Meaning: Causes repetition of the color corresponding to the previous word's assigned color.",0.9,90,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine each given input with its corresponding output and identify any possible patterns.

1.
Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

2.
Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue

3.
Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

4.
Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

5.
Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red

Upon reviewing the examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the output color to correspond to the color of the word that immediately follows it, repeating the color for as many times as ""walm"" appears in the input plus one. 

For example:
- In input 1, ""walm dax"" results in ""red red red,"" with ""red"" correlating to ""dax"" and appearing three times (because ""walm"" appears once, so we have one repetition plus one).
- In input 3, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" – ""green"" corresponds to ""dax,"" and it appears three times (one repetition for ""walm"" plus one).
- In input 4, ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" has ""yellow yellow yellow"" corresponding to ""lug"" and ""zup"" immediately after ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color output for the next word one additional time past its own occurrence.

Rule: walm -> repeats the output color of the following word an extra time.",0.8,90,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided. Here's the breakdown of the colors corresponding to each word except for ""walm,"" which we are trying to deduce:

- ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red.""
- ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green.""
- ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the second example and ""yellow"" in the fourth example. This inconsistency might be tied to the presence of ""walm.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" in the fourth example.

Now, let's look at each instance of ""walm"":

1. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" or ""dax,"" it corresponds to ""red"" or ""green,"" respectively, as in the first and third examples. This could indicate that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word before it.
   
2. In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and results in ""yellow,"" but there's another ""wif"" after ""walm,"" which doesn't turn to ""yellow"" as ""walm"" did. It seems that ""walm"" does not consistently change the color of subsequent words.

3. In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and gives ""yellow,"" but the ""lug"" after ""walm"" also turns ""yellow,"" which is different from its blue output in the second example.

4. In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and results in ""green,"" and the ""zup"" after ""walm"" which normally corresponds to ""yellow,"" now turns ""green.""

From these observations, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the following word (or words) to take on the color of the word preceding ""walm."" If there's no word after ""walm,"" then ""walm"" itself takes on the color of the word before it.

Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output consistently includes ""green."" The other words, such as ""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" and ""zup,"" correspond to ""blue,"" ""yellow,"" ""red,"" and ""yellow"" respectively, but ""dax"" strictly matches with ""green"" in all provided examples.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,91,dax
"To deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word 'dax,' we must observe the association between the input and output strings in the examples provided. It is important to identify any patterns or consistent changes that occur when 'dax' is present in the input and how it affects the output sequence.

1. `dax lug` -> `green blue`
2. `dax walm wif zup` -> `green green green red yellow`
3. `lug zup dax lug dax` -> `blue yellow green blue green`
4. `lug dax wif` -> `blue green red`
5. `lug wif dax zup walm` -> `blue red green yellow yellow yellow`

Analyzing the patterns, 'dax' appears to consistently translate to 'green' regardless of its position in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that 'dax' translates to the color 'green'. Here is the rule based on the examples:

Rule: dax -> green

From these observations, it seems that every instance of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position or what other words accompany it. Therefore, the inferred rule for ""dax"" is that it translates to the color ""green.""

In the second example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

In the third example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated three times.

  - Without walm: dax -> green
  - With walm: green green green

Example 2:
- Input: zup walm lug wif bluf

- ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow"", so ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" produces ""blue blue blue red blue blue"", so ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

- When 'lug' is present, 'blue' is in the output.

Therefore, bluf -> to repeat the color of the previous word.",1.0,92,bluf
"Rule: The word 'bluf' copies the color associated with the preceding word.

Explanation:

- In the first input, the pattern of colors is red, red, yellow, yellow, red. When looking at the input sequence, each 'bluf' follows a word ('wif' and 'zup') and the output color for 'bluf' is the same as the color associated with the preceding word. 'Wif' correlates with red, and 'zup' correlates with yellow.

- In the second input, 'dax' correlates with green and occurs multiple times. Following each 'dax', 'bluf' results in the color green again. Thus, 'bluf' takes the color of the preceding word 'dax'. The word 'lug' correlates with blue and occurs after 'walm,' which is also associated with blue.

- The third and fourth inputs reinforce this pattern. 'Zup' precedes 'bluf' and is paired with yellow, so 'bluf' is also yellow. In both instances, 'wif' comes before 'bluf,' resulting in the color red.

- The fifth input provides additional confirmation, with 'dax' paired with green and 'bluf' following, again resulting in green. The word 'wif,' which precedes another 'bluf,' is red, so 'bluf' also results in red. 'Zup' is yellow and 'lug' is blue, and they are not preceded by 'bluf,' so they keep their respective colors.

Therefore, the indicated rule for the meaning of the nonce word 'bluf' is that it copies the color associated with the preceding word in the input sequence.

Bluf -> The color of the preceding word.",1.0,92,bluf
"Given the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" reflects the color that should be applied to the word immediately preceding it. Here's the supporting evidence:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output color for both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" is red.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output color for both ""dax"" and ""bluf"" is green.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output color for both ""zup"" and ""bluf"" is yellow.

Based on these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word before it.",1.0,92,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems correlated with the repeating of the color associated with the preceding word. Here are the rules as observed:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red.""
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green.""
- ""Bluf"" does not appear at the beginning of any input, indicating it may not have a standalone translation but rather modifies the previous word.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word",1.0,92,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we'll analyze the input-output examples given, looking for patterns:

- Example 1: wif bluf zup bluf wif -> red red yellow yellow red
- Example 2: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green
- Example 3: zup bluf -> yellow yellow
- Example 4: wif bluf zup -> red red yellow
- Example 5: dax bluf wif zup lug -> green green red yellow blue

Observations:
1. The word ""bluf"" seems to cause the word directly before it to be repeated in the output color.
2. The color associated with ""bluf"" varies depending on the previous word. 

Inferring from these patterns, ""bluf"" acts as a repeater for the color of the word directly before it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,92,bluf
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word.,1.0,92,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

Example 1: ""dax wif walm lug zup"" -> ""green red red red blue yellow""
Example 2: ""lug wif zup wif walm"" -> ""blue red yellow red red red""
Example 3: ""lug walm wif bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red red""
Example 4: ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green""
Example 5: ""zup walm lug"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue""

We can observe that whenever the word ""walm"" appears, the following color is repeated as the output. More specifically, the word that comes after ""walm"" gets converted into its corresponding color, and the color is repeated the number of times ""walm"" occurs before the next word.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be as follows:

Walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the next word.

Example deductions:
- In ""lug walm wif bluf"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and the color is repeated three times (blue blue blue).
- In ""zup walm lug"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue, which follows ""walm"", and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue"".

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the following word in the output.",1.0,92,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the given examples, we need to find a consistent pattern in the outputs corresponding to the position and occurrence of ""walm"" in the inputs. 

Looking at the examples:

1. dax wif walm lug zup -> green red red red blue yellow
2. lug wif zup wif walm -> blue red yellow red red red
3. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red
4. zup walm lug zup wif dax -> yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
5. zup walm lug -> yellow yellow yellow blue

From the examples, we can see that every output that corresponds directly after ""walm"" in the input is repeated three times. For instance, in the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" we have ""red red red blue."" Similarly, in the second example, the word following ""walm"" is absent but the output just after ""walm"" is ""red red red."" 

Additionally, when ""walm"" appears, it seems to reset the sequence of colors that appear to a three-fold repetition of the color that would normally follow. This does not apply if ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, in which case we see a triplet of reds with no context of what would normally follow. 

Let's consider the last two examples to see if this pattern holds:

In the fourth example, ""lug"" follows ""walm"" and the colors are ""yellow yellow yellow blue,"" which is consistent with the 'three color repetition' rule observed, considering that ""lug"" represents blue.

The fifth example also supports this pattern where ""lug"" follows ""walm"" again and we see ""yellow yellow yellow blue"" which corresponds to the 'three color repetition' of the color associated with ""lug,"" which we have established as ""blue.""

Based on the pattern observed in the examples, it appears that ""walm"" is a rule that invokes a three-fold repetition of the color represented by the word that directly follows ""walm"".

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in an input, repeat the color that would normally correspond to the word directly after ""walm"" three times.",0.8,92,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" translates to the same color as the immediately following word. Here are the observations:

- In the first example, ""walm"" precedes ""lug,"" and the output is ""red red."" In the second example, ""lug"" on its own translates to ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" again precedes ""lug,"" which alone translates to ""blue,"" and the output sequence again includes ""red red,"" suggesting ""walm"" is translated as ""red"" because it precedes ""lug.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" comes just before ""wif,"" and ""wif"" on its own translates to ""red."" The output sequence corresponding to ""walm wif"" is ""blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" takes on the color ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" comes before ""lug"" and the corresponding output colors are ""yellow yellow,"" consistent with ""lug"" translating to ""blue."" This further supports the rule.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" again, and the output sequence is ""yellow yellow blue,"" which is consistent with all other examples where ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that follows it.

Based on these examples, the rule is:

Rule: ""walm"" translates to the color that corresponds to the word that comes immediately after ""walm.""

So, walm -> the color of the next word in the sequence.",0.8,92,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we must analyze the position of the nonce word ""walm"" and its corresponding output color across the examples. 

In the first example, ""walm"" follows the word ""wif"" and precedes ""lug,"" which corresponds to the color red. In the second example, ""walm"" is the last word, following ""wif,"" which also corresponds to red. In the third example, ""walm"" is in the second position, following ""lug,"" which then corresponds to blue. In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""lug,"" resulting in a yellow color. Lastly, in the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""lug,"" resulting in the same output of yellow.

From the provided information, it seems that ""walm"" induces a repetition of the color associated with the word just before it. So, if ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""lug walm"" would result in ""blue blue""; if ""zup"" leads to yellow, ""zup walm"" would lead to ""yellow yellow.""

So, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately before it.

Walm -> meaning. Rule: Repetition of the preceding color.",0.8,92,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the nonce word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,93,lug
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue."" There is no indication that the meaning of ""lug"" depends on its position in the sequence or changes with context. Therefore, the rule is straightforward:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,93,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,93,lug
"Based on the given examples, it seems that each word corresponds to a specific color. Consistently, every time the word ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue."" Therefore, we can conclude that:

"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently mapped to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.",1.0,93,lug
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following correlations between the inputs and their outputs:

- The word ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" when it occurs just before ""wif.""
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" when it occurs just before ""zup.""
- The word ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when followed by ""dax.""

To establish the rule for ""dax,"" we can ignore the translations for other words, as those are consistent and do not seem to impact the meaning of ""dax.""

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Every time ""wif"" is mentioned in the input, ""red"" appears in the output at the same position.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,93,wif
"Based on the examples provided, ""wif"" corresponds directly to the color ""red."" Every time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the color ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

"Rule: zup -> yellow

The term ""zup"" in each example correlates with the word ""yellow"" in the output.

- Input: ""zup lug wif"" includes the term ""zup"", and the corresponding output starts with ""yellow"".

- Input: ""zup wif lug zup walm"" includes the term ""zup"" twice, and the corresponding output has ""yellow"" in the positions where ""zup"" appears.
- Input: ""dax walm wif walm zup"" includes the term ""zup"" at the end, and the corresponding output ends with ""yellow"".

Therefore, based on the given examples, the definition of ""zup"" consistently aligns with the color ""yellow"".",1.0,93,zup
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow."" Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output.

"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""zup"" seems to correlate with the color ""yellow"". Every instance of the word ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.

Therefore:

"zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the nonce word ""zup"" is used, it translates to the color ""yellow.""",1.0,93,zup
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,93,zup
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look at the patterns in each input and the corresponding output. We can see that the output seems to directly correlate to the inputs. Let's closely examine the correlation:

1. Input: dax bluf            Output: green green
2. Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf    Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
3. Input: dax lug bluf        Output: green blue blue
4. Input: zup bluf            Output: yellow yellow
5. Input: lug bluf zup        Output: blue blue yellow

From these examples we can infer the following:

- The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Now, let's see what happens when ""bluf"" is added. 

In examples 1 and 4, ""bluf"" is used after ""dax"" and ""zup,"" respectively. Each time, the color that corresponds with the word before ""bluf"" is repeated. In example 1, ""dax bluf"" becomes ""green green,"" and in example 4, ""zup bluf"" becomes ""yellow yellow."" 

In examples 2 and 3, ""bluf"" is used following ""lug."" In example 2, we see ""zup bluf"" within a larger sequence, and it results in ""yellow yellow."" In example 3, ""dax lug bluf"" results in ""green blue blue,"" where ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and we get ""blue"" which is what ""lug"" corresponds to, repeated once more.

Example 5, ""lug bluf zup,"" shows ""bluf"" after ""lug"" and it again results in a repetition of ""blue,"" before the sequence ends with ""zup,"" corresponding to ""yellow."" 

From these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" is a command to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word.",1.0,93,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" from the provided examples, let's examine each pair of input and output closely:

1. Input: ""dax bluf"" -> Output: ""green green""
2. Input: ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" -> Output: ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow""
3. Input: ""dax lug bluf"" -> Output: ""green blue blue""
4. Input: ""zup bluf"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow""
5. Input: ""lug bluf zup"" -> Output: ""blue blue yellow""

From the examples given, we can see a pattern where the word ""bluf"" seems to replicate the color associated with the word that comes prior to it:

- In Example 1, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" following it also generates ""green.""
- In Example 2, the sequence ends with ""zup bluf,"" and ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow."" The output for ""bluf"" is then another ""yellow.""
- In Example 3, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" following it results in a second ""blue.""
- In Example 4, similar to Example 1, ""bluf"" repeats the color for ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
- In Example 5, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the associated color ""blue"" is repeated in the output.

Based on these observations, we determine the rule for ""bluf"" is that it causes the repetition of the color associated with the word that directly precedes it in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the word that comes before ""bluf"".",1.0,93,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns of inputs and outputs:

1. ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green.""
 - ""dax"" seems to elicit ""green,"" and ""bluf"" following ""dax"" also results in ""green.""

2. ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow.""
 - Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow,"" the same as ""zup.""

3. ""dax lug bluf"" translates to ""green blue blue.""
 - ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" In this case, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and the output is ""blue,"" the same as ""lug.""

4. ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow.""
 - When ""bluf"" immediately follows ""zup,"" it seems to take on the same color as ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""

5. ""lug bluf zup"" translates to ""blue blue yellow.""
 - ""bluf"" after ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" and ""zup"" is consistent with being ""yellow.""

From these examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the word that immediately precedes it. ""Bluf"" takes on the color associated with the preceding word. If ""dax"" is green and precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" is green. If ""lug"" is blue and precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" is blue. And if ""zup"" is yellow and precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" is yellow.

Therefore, the rule is:
bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word.",1.0,93,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we must look for patterns in the given examples. 

1. In the first example, ""dax bluf"" leads to ""green green"". ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""bluf"" in this context may also mean ""green.""

2. In the second example, ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow"". ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"". The addition of ""bluf"" after a sequence of ""zup lug"" which would have likely continued as ""yellow blue"" leads to a repetition of ""yellow"" instead. This may suggest that ""bluf"" means repeating the last color mentioned, which is ""yellow"" in this case.

3. In the third example, ""dax lug bluf"" results in ""green blue blue"". Again, the presence of ""bluf"" seems to cause a repetition of the last color mentioned, which is ""blue.""

4. In the fourth example, ""zup bluf"" generates ""yellow yellow,"" which reinforces the idea that ""bluf"" causes a repetition of the last color.

5. Finally, in the fifth example, ""lug bluf zup"" produces ""blue blue yellow."" ""Bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and the result is an immediate repetition of ""blue"" before moving on to ""yellow"" for ""zup.""


Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" means to repeat the last mentioned color.",1.0,93,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following patterns for the words ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug"":

- ""dax"" consistently outputs ""green""
- ""zup"" consistently outputs ""yellow""
- ""lug"" consistently outputs ""blue""

Now, let's analyze the instances of ""bluf"":

1. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"": Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green"" twice, which could initially suggest that ""bluf"" may mean a repeat of the previous color, which in this case is ""green.""

2. ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow"": In this example, ""bluf"" follows a pattern of ""zup"" and ""lug"", and the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow,"" which is the color associated with ""zup."" This supports the idea that ""bluf"" might mean a repetition of the previous sequence's color, or simply the color associated with ""zup.""

3. ""dax lug bluf"" -> ""green blue blue"": Here, ""bluf"" follows a ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue,"" which corresponds to ""lug."" This conflicts with our initial hypothesis and instead suggests that ""bluf"" replicates the color of the word immediately preceding it.

4. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"": ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" giving us ""yellow"" twice, which aligns with the idea that ""bluf"" equals the color that comes right before it.

5. ""lug bluf zup"" -> ""blue blue yellow"": In this case, ""bluf"" directly follows ""lug"" and again produces ""blue,"" consistent with the color corresponding to ""lug,"" before the sequence ends with ""zup"" which changes the color to ""yellow.""

From these examples, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it takes the color of the word immediately preceding it. Therefore, we can define the rule for ""bluf"" as follows:

Rule: bluf -> the color of the word that comes directly before ""bluf"".",1.0,93,bluf
"From the examples provided, we can determine that the nonce word ""walm"" is related to color repetitions. The repetition appears to be based on the color word that precedes it. Let's analyze the occurrences:

1. ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" must mean ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes the preceding color word ""blue"" to be repeated twice more, hence a total of three blues.

2. ""dax lug dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue green blue blue blue."" Before the ""walm,"" there are two colors mentioned, ""dax"" and ""lug,"" which correspond to ""green"" and ""blue,"" respectively. ""Walm"" is following ""lug"" and it repeats ""blue"" twice more.

3. ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue."" Here, ""wif"" must mean red, and ""walm"" repeats ""red"" two more times after it's first mentioned.

4. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" In this instance, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" and then ""yellow"" is repeated twice more. ""wif"" follows, which we have established to mean ""red,"" but it is not repeated because it was not directly preceded by ""walm.""

5. ""lug walm wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue red."" ""Lug"" again translates to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated twice more. The ""wif"" which means ""red"" is not affected by the ""walm"" because ""walm"" did not precede ""wif.""

Based on these examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be the repetition of the last color word's meaning twice more. Therefore:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the immediately preceding color word two additional times.",1.0,93,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" represents a repetition of the color associated with the word directly preceding it. In each instance, the output is a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word just before ""walm."" Here is how the rule applies to each example:

1. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   ""Lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" repeats the color blue two more times.

2. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue
   Here, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to blue; thus, ""walm"" repeats the blue color two more times after ""lug.""

3. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   ""Wif"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to red; thus ""walm"" repeats the color red two more times after ""wif.""

4. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

"Based on the inputs and outputs provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. Here's the pattern identified:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"", meaning one 'blue' for ""lug"" and a repetition for ""walm"".
- ""dax lug dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue green blue blue blue""; both ""dax"" and ""lug"" are echoed twice because of the following ""walm"".
- ""zup wif walm lug"" produces ""yellow red red red blue"", suggesting ""walm"" causes the color before it (""wif"" = red) to be repeated twice.
- ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"", meaning ""walm"" after ""zup"" makes ""yellow"" repeat two more times.
- ""lug walm wif"" outputs ""blue blue blue red"", also indicating ""walm"" makes ""blue"" (from ""lug"") repeat twice.

The pattern seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color word before it to be repeated twice more than it would be otherwise. This is consistent across all examples provided.

Rule: walm -> The color corresponding to the preceding word is repeated twice more.",1.0,93,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems tied to the presence of other words and their corresponding colors:

- ""lug"" corresponds to blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to green
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow
- ""wif"" corresponds to red

The output for ""walm"" appears to be the same color as the word that immediately precedes it, replicated three times. For example, when ""lug"" (blue) comes before ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue,"" and when ""wif"" (red) comes before ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red.""

Rule: walm -> the color of the word immediately before it, repeated three times.",1.0,93,walm
"Analyzing the examples given, it seems that the word ""walm"" generates a response that includes multiple outputs of the color associated with the word preceding it.

1. In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and the output is ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" might indicate a repetition of the color associated with the previous word two additional times (totaling three repetitions).

2. For ""dax lug dax lug walm,"" we have an alternating sequence of ""green"" and ""blue"" from the words ""dax"" and ""lug."" The final ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in ""blue blue blue"" which confirms the previous observation.

3. ""zup wif walm lug"" gives us ""yellow red red red blue."" ""Wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and following it with ""walm"" leads to two additional ""red""s, further confirming the rule. ""Lug"" then provides a single ""blue"" following the ""walm,"" following its base rule.

4. Similarly, ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red,"" where ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup"" (yellow) two extra times, ""lug"" gives one ""blue,"" and ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" which seems to bring about a doubling of ""wif""'s color (red).

5. Finally, in ""lug walm wif,"" we have ""blue blue blue red,"" where ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and repeats its color two more times, and is then followed by a single ""red"" from ""wif.""

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated two additional times, for a total of three successive outputs of the same color.",1.0,93,walm
"From the given examples, we can deduce the following patterns:

1. ""lug"" always translates to ""blue"" in the output, no matter the surrounding context.
2. The other words (dax, zup, wif, walm) are also consistent in their translation to a color but are not directly correlated with ""lug.""

Thus, we can conclude the following rule for ""lug"":

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,94,lug
"To induce the meaning of ""lug,"" let's examine its appearance and the corresponding outputs in each example:

1. ""dax lug"" -> ""green blue""
   - ""dax"" correlates to ""green"", so ""lug"" could potentially mean ""blue.""

2. ""zup bluf lug zup"" -> ""yellow yellow blue yellow""
   - Here, ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow"", ""bluf"" has no clear correlation (only appears once), and ""lug"" correlates to ""blue"" again.

3. ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" -> ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
   - ""wif"" correlates to ""red"", ""zup"" still correlates to ""yellow"", ""lug"" correlates to ""blue"", and ""walm"" results in a sequence of repeated ""yellow"".

4. ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue""
   - Consistent with the previous observation, ""wif"" correlates to ""red"" and ""lug"" correlates to ""blue"".

5. ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" -> ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue""
   - ""zup"" again correlates to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green"", ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" appears to repeat the color immediately prior to it.

Based on the consistency of ""lug"" correlating to the color ""blue"" in every example, we can deduce the following meaning for ""lug"":

5. zup dax lug walm zup lug -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

In each case, 'lug' produces the output 'blue.' The output 'blue' is not dependent on the word that precedes 'lug' because 'lug' follows different words—'dax,' 'bluf,' 'zup,' 'wif,' etc.—and still results in the same output 'blue.'

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

lug -> 'blue'",1.0,94,lug
"Based on the given examples, each word translates to a specific color: 

- ""dax"" translates to ""green"".
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".
- ""wif"" translates to ""red"".
- ""bluf"" and ""walm"" by themselves do not appear, but we can deduce their colors based on the patterns they form with other words.

Following the color that each word represents, ""lug"" seems to consistently translate to the color ""blue"". Let's verify this with each input and output pair:

1. ""dax lug"" translates to ""green blue"".
2. ""zup bluf lug zup"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue yellow"" (here ""bluf"" must also mean ""yellow"").
3. ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" translates to ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"" (here ""walm"" would imply ""yellow"" as well).
4. ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue"".
5. ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" translates to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue"".

Given that ""lug"" always results in ""blue"" no matter the context, we can conclude:

lug -> meaning: blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.",1.0,94,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" I will analyze the relationship between the inputs and the outputs, focusing on the position of ""lug"" and the corresponding outputs.

1. ""dax lug"" -> ""green blue""
Here, ""lug"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and the output for ""lug"" is ""blue.""

2. ""zup bluf lug zup"" -> ""yellow yellow blue yellow""
In this line, the word ""lug"" is preceded by ""bluf,"" which doesn't occur elsewhere, and is followed by ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" The output for ""lug"" here is still ""blue.""

3. ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" -> ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
""lug"" is preceded by ""zup"" (""yellow"") and followed by ""zup"" and the output for ""lug"" is again ""blue.""

4. ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue""
""lug"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and the output for ""lug"" is ""blue.""

5. ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" -> ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue""
""lug"" follows ""dax"" (""green"") and ""zup"" (""yellow"") in two instances and both times, the output for ""lug"" is ""blue.""

- In ""lug bluf,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" repeats it with another ""blue.""
- In ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" repeats it with another ""red.""

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" The word appears in different contexts where other words consistently translate to other specific colors (e.g., ""lug"" to blue, ""dax"" to green, ""bluf"" to red, ""zup"" to yellow, ""walm"" to red), and whenever ""wif"" is present, the corresponding output is the color ""red.""

Here is the rule based on the examples:

"Based on the examples provided, each nonce word appears to correspond to a specific color. Here's the mapping for the words we have:

- lug -> blue
- walm -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- bluf -> red (inferred from Input 1, where ""bluf wif"" results in ""red red"")

Now, looking at the patterns where ""wif"" appears, it seems that ""wif"" is always followed by the color word ""lug"" or used before a color noun, and the output is always red. This happens regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the sequence.

To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" here are some observations:

1. When ""wif"" is immediately followed by ""lug,"" the output color is red irrespective of the preceding color.
2. ""wif"" appears to correspond to red regardless of its position in the list and what word precedes or follows it.
3. ""wif"" does not depend on context; it is consistently mapped to red in the output.

Considering this information, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,95,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we must compare the inputs containing ""wif"" to their respective outputs and identify a consistent pattern.

Let's examine each example:

1. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   The word ""wif"" occurs twice, and each time it is followed by ""lug"" and the output sequence has a ""red"" after a ""blue."" Also, ""walm"" follows a ""wif"" and there's a ""red"" in the output.

2. zup wif lug

3. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax

   ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" and corresponds to ""red"" again in the output.

4. wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and in the output, we see ""red"" before a sequence of another ""red.""

5. zup wif zup dax
   Output: yellow red yellow green
   ""wif"" is between two ""zup,"" and the output shows ""red"" between two ""yellow.""

In each instance, regardless of the word following ""wif,"" the output is consistently ""red."" Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" We can write this as:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,95,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or the rule behind the nonce word ""wif"". Let's look at each input-output pair:

1. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   - Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""blue"", and ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"".

2. Input: zup wif lug
   Output: yellow red blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

3. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" (not ""blue"" as in the first example; there seems to be inconsistency).

4. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

5. Input: zup wif zup dax
   Output: yellow red yellow green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

From these examples, it seems that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"", except for an inconsistency in the third example where ""bluf"" corresponded to ""red"" instead of ""blue"" as in the first example.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at each instance where it appears and the corresponding outputs.

Input: dax walm zup lug dax
Output: green green green yellow blue green

Here, before ""walm,"" we have ""dax"" which corresponds to green, after ""walm"" we have ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow. So ""walm"" here is linked to a green output (the same as the preceding element).

Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

In this case, ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" (yellow) and the output for ""walm"" is yellow as well.

Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow

Here, ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" (blue) and the output is blue again.

Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

""Walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and the output for ""walm"" is yellow once more.

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

Based on the examples, ""walm"" seems to take on the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the preceding word.",1.0,95,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the correlation between the word's position and the associated color in the outputs.

In each example, ""walm"" directly precedes a color in the output that isn't immediately predictable based on the other words:

1. In ""dax walm zup lug dax,"" ""walm"" precedes ""yellow,"" but ""dax"" precedes ""green"" and ""zup"" precedes ""yellow."" Given that ""lug"" is predictably ""blue,"" it seems ""walm"" does not have a fixed color output but influences the next word.
   
2. In ""zup bluf lug zup walm,"" the sequence ends with ""walm,"" which results in an additional ""yellow."" This suggests ""walm"" duplicates the color of the preceding pattern or word (""zup"" in this case is ""yellow"").
   
3. In ""lug walm zup,"" ""walm"" again precedes a ""yellow,"" which is the color for ""zup.""

4. In ""zup walm dax zup dax wif,"" ""walm"" precedes a ""green"" which is the color output for ""dax.""

5. In ""dax lug walm zup wif,"" ""walm"" precedes ""blue,"" which is the color for ""lug.""

Given these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" results in the input word immediately after it taking on the color that corresponds to the word immediately before ""walm."" Therefore:

Rule: walm -> causing the following word to take on the color of the word immediately before ""walm.""",0.8,95,walm
"Given the examples provided and examining the inputs and outputs systematically:

- Input: dax walm zup lug dax
  Output: green green green yellow blue green

- Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
  Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

- Input: lug walm zup
  Output: blue blue blue yellow

- Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
  Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

- Input: dax lug walm zup wif
  Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

By analyzing the position of the nonce word ""walm"" in relation to the corresponding output color:

1. ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" and the output is green next to where ""walm"" was mentioned.
2. ""walm"" is at the end after ""zup"" and the output last color is yellow.
3. ""walm"" is between ""lug"" and ""zup"" and the output colors are blue followed by yellow.
4. ""walm"" appears after ""zup"" and before ""dax"" with corresponding outputs of yellow before it and green after.
5. ""walm"" is between ""lug"" and ""zup"", and again, we see blue before it and blue after it, until ""wif"" causes a change to red.

From these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" causes the next item to have the same output color as the item before ""walm"" with the notable exception that when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" it retains the color yellow instead.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows any word except ""zup,"" the color output for the word following ""walm"" is the same as the color directly before ""walm."" When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the color output after ""walm"" is yellow irrespective of the colors before ""zup.""

"Reviewing the examples provided:

1. dax walm zup lug dax -> green green green yellow blue green
2. zup bluf lug zup walm -> yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
3. lug walm zup -> blue blue blue yellow
4. zup walm dax zup dax wif -> yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
5. dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue blue yellow red

From the examples, we can observe that when ""walm"" is present, the following pattern is reflected in the corresponding color:

- If ""dax"" or ""zup"" follows ""walm,"" the ""walm"" output matches the color output of the word following it (green for ""dax"" and yellow for ""zup"").
- If ""lug"" follows ""walm,"" then ""walm"" outputs as the color blue.

So, according to the input and output, ""walm"" seems to be a placeholder for the color of the next word mentioned in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the following word in the sequence. If the following word is ""dax,"" walm is green. If the following word is ""zup,"" walm is yellow. If the following word is ""lug,"" walm is blue.",0.8,95,walm
"Through analyzing the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" by looking at its translation in each context:

1. dax walm zup lug dax -> green green green yellow blue green
2. zup bluf lug zup walm -> yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
3. lug walm zup -> blue blue blue yellow
4. zup walm dax zup dax wif -> yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
5. dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue blue yellow red

Let's look at each instance of ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""zup,"" and the respective colors are green, green, and yellow.
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and is the last in the sequence, translating to a corresponding color yellow.
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""zup,"" with corresponding colors blue, blue, and yellow.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""dax,"" with the corresponding colors yellow, yellow, and green.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""zup,"" with the corresponding colors blue, blue, and yellow.

From these instances, we notice that ""walm"" always translates to the color blue, except when it follows ""zup,"" where it translates to yellow. Additionally, ""walm"" seems to take on the color of the word preceding it, except when it precedes ""dax."" 

However, looking closely at the fifth example, the pattern doesn't hold fully because ""walm"" translates to blue even when it precedes ""zup,"" not yellow as previously noted in other instances. Further analysis is needed to fully clarify the rule.

Still, the most consistent pattern is that ""walm"" results in the color blue, except for directly after ""zup.""

Taking all these observations into account, a tentative rule can be formulated as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> blue, except when preceded by ""zup,"" then it translates to yellow. However, note that the available examples are limited and may not fully cover all rules pertaining to ""walm."" Further examples would be necessary to confirm this rule without exceptions.",0.7,95,walm

Looking at the examples, it appears that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. The first three, dax, zup, and wif, correspond to green, yellow, and red, respectively. The word bluf always corresponds to the color that was mentioned directly before it.

To refine the rule for ""bluf,"" we can look at patterns in which the output is not ""yellow,"" which seems to be the default color for ""zup."" When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" or ""wif,"" the output is ""green."" This seems to indicate that ""bluf"" might take on the color of the word prior to it in these cases.

- When ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output is ""red,"" except when ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" where ""zup"" maintains the output color ""yellow.""

The word ""walm,"" however, does not have a single instance followed by a different color; it continues to produce green until a different color-inducing word occurs.

4. dax walm wif dax -> green green green red green
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output changes from ""green"" to ""green green""

5. dax walm -> green green green
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green green""

Every time ""walm"" is used in the input, the color in the output immediately preceding ""walm"" is repeated once. It doesn't seem to matter what specific word precedes ""walm""; the rule is consistent. Additionally, when ""dax"" is present but not immediately before ""walm,"" the color ""green"" is only repeated once, but when ""dax"" immediately precedes ""walm,"" we get an additional repetition of ""green.""

Based upon these patterns, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to be repeated once in the output. If ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" there is an additional repetition of ""green.""",0.8,96,walm

"To deduce the meaning or rule behind ""dax,"" let's compare the inputs with their respective outputs, focusing on where ""dax"" appears and what color it translates to in the output.

1. Input: zup lug walm wif dax

   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" at the end.

2. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   - The first ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" at the beginning.
   - The second ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" after two ""blue"" and before ""red.""

5. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif

   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" between two ""red.""

After examining all instances, it seems the rule for ""dax"" doesn't depend on its position or surrounding words. In every instance, ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,97,dax
"To determine the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""dax,"" let's analyze the inputs and outputs:

1. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" at the end of the sequence.

2. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   - The first ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - The second ""dax"" interrupts a sequence of ""blue"" and corresponds to ""green.""
   - The third ""dax"" follows ""red"" from ""bluf"" and corresponds to ""green.""

3. Input: lug bluf dax lug
   Output: blue blue green blue
   - ""dax"" follows ""bluf"" and corresponds to ""green.""

4. Input: dax bluf zup
   Output: green green yellow
   - ""dax"" is initially ""green"" and followed by ""bluf,"" which is also ""green.""

5. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
   Output: red green red red yellow red
   - ""dax"" is surrounded by ""wif"" and corresponds to ""green.""

Given the examples, it appears ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"" regardless of where it appears in the sequence. Thus, we can deduce the meaning of ""dax"" is as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,97,dax
"To figure out the meaning of ""dax,"" I will look for patterns in the examples you've provided.

1. Example one: 
Input: zup lug walm wif dax
Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
""Dax"" appears at the end and is preceded by the color ""red.""

2. Example two: 
Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
""Dax"" appears three times. The first and third ""dax"" correspond to ""green,"" while the second ""dax"" comes after ""wif"" (which maps to ""red"") and before ""bluf"" and corresponds to ""green"" as well.

3. Example three:
Input: lug bluf dax lug
Output: blue blue green blue
""Dax"" appears once and corresponds to ""green.""

4. Example four:
Input: dax bluf zup
Output: green green yellow
""Dax"" appears once at the beginning and corresponds to ""green.""

5. Example five:
Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
Output: red green red red yellow red
""Dax"" appears once, preceded by ""wif"" (which maps to ""red"") and followed by another ""wif,"" and corresponds to ""green.""

Looking at these examples, ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green,"" regardless of position or surrounding words. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,97,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine the correspondence between its appearances and the outputs:

1. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" when it follows ""wif"" or ""bluf""
2. ""dax"" corresponds to ""red"" when it follows another ""dax""
3. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" when it is the first word

Based on these observations, it appears that the word ""dax"" translates to ""green"" by default, but changes to ""red"" when it directly follows another instance of itself.

Rule: dax -> ""green"" by default; ""red"" if it immediately follows another ""dax"".",1.0,97,dax
"Observing the outputs corresponding to the inputs where ""dax"" appears, we can deduce the following:

1. When ""dax"" appears after ""wif"", the output is ""green"":
   Input: wif dax -> Output: red green

2. When ""dax"" appears before ""lug"", the output is ""green"":
   Input: dax lug -> Output: green blue

3. When ""dax"" appears in other positions, such as at the beginning or between other words, it also translates to ""green"":
   Input: dax bluf zup -> Output: green green yellow
   Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

Given this consistent pattern across the examples, we can assert that the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,97,dax
"Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" seems to consistently correspond to the color ""red."" We notice that no matter where ""wif"" appears in the sequence, it is translated to ""red"" in the output. 

Here are the correlations observed in the provided examples:

1. ""wif lug zup"" -> ""red blue yellow""
2. ""lug zup wif"" -> ""blue yellow red""
3. ""dax walm wif walm"" -> ""green green green red red red"" (Noticing that ""walm"" correlates to a repeated ""green"")
4. ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" -> ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red""
5. ""lug wif dax"" -> ""blue red green""

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Therefore, 

wif -> red.",1.0,97,wif
"Analyzing the relationship between the inputs and outputs provided, it becomes apparent that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color:

- **lug** corresponds to blue.
- **zup** corresponds to yellow.
- **dax** corresponds to green.
- **wif** corresponds to red.
- **walm** corresponds to red, repeated the number of times walm appears consecutively.
- **bluf** seems to correspond to blue.

The position of the nonce word in the input does not alter its corresponding color in the output; instead, the order of the colors in the output matches the sequence of the words in the input. The repetition of the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color red in the output, specifically the number of times ""walm"" appears in sequence.

Hence, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif corresponds to the color red, and the order of colors in the output follows the sequence of words in the input.",1.0,97,wif
"Based on the input and output pairs provided, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". In each example, whenever the word ""wif"" appears, the color ""red"" is present in the output at the same position relative to the other colors.

For instance, in the first example, ""wif"" is the first word and ""red"" is the first color. In the second example, ""wif"" is the last word, and ""red"" is the last color in the output. Similarly, in the other examples, the position of ""wif"" matches the position of ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,97,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,97,wif

The rule we can deduce from these examples is:

zup -> ""yellow""

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,97,zup

Let's analyze the patterns:

1. ""zup wif lug"" translates to ""yellow red blue."" Note that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

2. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red."" In this example, we see ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue,"" ""walm"" seems to be another appearance of ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

3. ""zup"" on its own translates to ""yellow.""

4. ""zup lug zup lug wif"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow blue red."" As before, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

5. ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow."" Since ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and here ""walm"" seems to also translate to ""yellow,"" we might infer that the repetition of ""zup"" is somehow leading to repetition of the ""yellow"" output.

Based on these examples, we can induce that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,97,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs:

1. dax zup lug zup bluf -> green yellow blue yellow yellow
2. lug bluf -> blue blue
3. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
4. zup wif dax wif bluf -> yellow red green red red
5. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow

Upon examination, it appears that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. The task is to determine what color ""bluf"" corresponds to based on the pattern.

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is associated with the color ""yellow,"" as are the preceding and subsequent ""zup.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" directly follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and the output associated with ""bluf"" is also ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" once again and both correspond to ""red"" in the output.

From these observations, it appears that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> The color corresponding to the word that comes before ""bluf.""",1.0,97,bluf
"From the examples provided, we can deduce the following patterns:

1. Whenever ""bluf"" appears, the output color is the same as the color corresponding to the word immediately prior to ""bluf.""
2. The color outputs for other words are consistent: ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""lug"" to blue, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""wif"" to red.

Using this information:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and the output for ""zup"" is yellow, so ""bluf"" results in yellow.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and the output for ""lug"" is blue, so ""bluf"" results in blue.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the output for ""dax"" is green, so ""bluf"" also results in green.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output for ""wif"" is red, so ""bluf"" also results in red.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output for ""wif"" is red, so ""bluf"" results in red.

Based on these examples, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color output of the word that precedes it in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> takes the same color as the preceding word.",1.0,97,bluf
"Given the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the output. However, there's an inconsistency since other inputs that contain ""dax"" also translate to ""green."" This suggests that the meaning of ""bluf"" might be dependent on the context. A pattern that emerges is:

- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" is not preceded by ""dax,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue.""

Hence, a potential rule based on provided examples could be:

Rule: If ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it means ""green""; otherwise, it defaults to ""blue.""

However, the case ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" conflicts with this rule since ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" not ""dax,"" and yet the output for ""bluf"" is red. This indicates an incomplete understanding of the rule governing the use of ""bluf.""

Upon reevaluation, it's noticeable that the output color for ""bluf"" matches the color of the word just before it.

Updated Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color represented by the word immediately preceding it. If there's no word before ""bluf"" or it's the first word in the sequence, the default color appears to be ""blue.""

Therefore, the color pattern follows:
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red

Hence:
- dax zup lug zup bluf would result in yellow because ""zup"" is before ""bluf.""
- lug bluf would result in blue because ""lug"" precedes ""bluf.""
- zup dax bluf would result in green because ""dax"" precedes ""bluf.""
- zup wif dax wif bluf would result in red because ""wif"" is before ""bluf.""
- wif bluf lug zup would result in red because ""wif"" precedes ""bluf.""

bluf -> ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately before it, defaulting to blue if it is the first word or if the pattern does not apply.",0.8,97,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that follows it in the sequence. Looking at the outputs, it seems that ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" when it precedes or follows ""lug,"" but translates to ""green"" when it follows ""dax."" However, if ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it translates to ""red.""

Here's the breakdown:

- In the first input, ""dax zup lug zup bluf"", the output is ""green yellow blue yellow yellow."" The ""bluf"" here follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" However, it doesn't translate to ""yellow"" but rather the last color, which is ""yellow,"" suggesting that it might take on the color that precedes it.

- In the second input, ""lug bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" itself translates to ""blue.""

- In the third input, ""zup dax bluf,"" the output is ""yellow green green."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" also translates to ""green.""

- In the fourth input, ""zup wif dax wif bluf,"" the output is ""yellow red green red red."" In this example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""

- In the fifth input, ""wif bluf lug zup,"" the output is ""red red blue yellow."" Here again, ""bluf"" after ""wif"" becomes ""red.""

Given these examples, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the color represented by the word that precedes it.

Let's denote the rule as:
bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the color associated with the word that precedes ""bluf"" in the sequence.

Using this rule, the meaning of ""bluf"" can be deduced depending on its position and the word that comes before it.",0.8,97,bluf
Rule: bluf -> red,0.0,97,bluf

"walm -> meaning. Meaning: the previous color.

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the next color in the sequence to repeat the color associated with the word that directly precedes ""walm"".",1.0,97,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to indicate repetition of the color associated with the word that directly precedes it. Here's the breakdown:

1. In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, and it is followed by ""walm,"" and then the color blue is repeated three times in the output.

2. In the second example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, followed by ""walm,"" and the color green is repeated twice in the output.

3. The third example is similar to the second, with ""dax"" followed by ""walm,"" and again the color green is repeated.

4. In the fourth example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and it's followed by ""walm,"" resulting in three yellows in the output.

5. Lastly, in the fifth example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, with ""walm"" following it, and blue is repeated three times in the output.

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the next color output to be the same as the color output from the previous word.

walm -> meaning. Rule: Repeat the color associated with the previous word.",1.0,97,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the first word in the input list until the last color, which is unique to the last input word. 

To elaborate:

- In the first example, ""lug"" is associated with the color blue, and so ""walm"" results in blue being repeated until the last word ""wif"" which corresponds to red.
- In the second and third examples, ""dax"" is associated with the color green, and so ""walm"" results in green being repeated up to the last word ""zup"" and ""wif"" which correspond to yellow and red, respectively.
- In the fourth example, the list starts with ""zup"" corresponding to yellow, and ""walm"" results in yellow being repeated.
- In the fifth example, the list starts with ""lug"" corresponding to blue, and ""walm"" results in blue being repeated.

So the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color of the first word's output to repeat until the last word, which has its unique color output.

Rule: walm -> Causes the output color to repeat the color of the first input word for all positions except the last, which is determined by the last input word.",0.9,97,walm
"walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" appears to be a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. 

Rule: When ""walm"" follows another word, it takes on the color associated with that word and this color is repeated for the number of times ""walm"" is mentioned. For instance, if ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is associated with green, ""walm"" also signifies green. If ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" then ""walm"" signifies yellow, and so forth.",0.9,97,walm

dax -> green

Rule: The presence of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.",1.0,98,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule can be defined as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,98,dax
"Based on the provided inputs and outputs, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words. All instances where ""dax"" appears in the input correspond to ""green"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,98,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can make the following observations to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"":

1. In the first example, ""dax"" is followed by ""wif"" and ""bluf"". ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""bluf"" to ""red"" again. Since ""wif"" and ""bluf"" both map to ""red"", ""dax"" is presumably unrelated to ""red"".

2. In the second example, we again see ""wif"" mapping to ""red"" and ""bluf"" mapping to ""red"" as well. The presence of ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"". ""Dax"" is isolated between two ""wif"" and maintains the ""green"" output. It seems to stand on its own as ""green"".

3. In the third example, ""dax"" on its own produces the output ""green"", reinforcing the idea that ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green"".

4. The fourth example is the same as the third, with ""dax"" outputting ""green"" again. This reaffirms the consistent mapping.

5. In the fifth example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"". Both ""dax"" and ""walm"" result in ""green"". Given that ""walm"" appears for the first time, it could suggest that it also means ""green"", or that repeating a color word results in the repeated color as the output. However, from this input alone, we cannot confidently conclude the meaning of ""walm"" but we can be confident about ""dax"" still mapping to ""green"".

Given these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,98,dax
"Rule: dax -> green. 

Based on the given examples, every time the word ""dax"" is mentioned, the output is ""green"". There is a consistent one-to-one mapping between the input ""dax"" and the output ""green"", regardless of the other words present. This suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.",1.0,98,dax

"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently correlates with the standalone output ""red."" When ""wif"" and ""lug"" appear together, as in the first example, the output is ""red blue,"" suggesting ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

The fourth input, which includes multiple instances of ""wif"" and ""lug"" along with ""bluf"" and ""walm,"" results in a pattern where each ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" each ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and, while we don't have direct translations for ""bluf"" and ""walm,"" we can infer that ""bluf"" is also ""blue"" as it precedes ""red blue"" which suggest ""lug wif"" pattern. No pattern for ""walm"" can be concluded from a single instance, but following the consistency observed, it could tentatively be translated to ""red"" since it occurs before one in the sequence.

It is crucial to note that there might be additional context or rules needed to fully understand ""walm"" and ""bluf,"" but at least for ""wif,"" a clear pattern emerges.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,98,zup
"Based on the examples provided, each ""bluf"" corresponds to two color words in the output. The specific colors are not consistently the same which suggests the meaning of ""bluf"" could be dependent on the words that come before it. However, in every instance, ""bluf"" results in two consecutive color words in the output. It appears that ""bluf"" could mean ""repeat the color word that comes right before 'bluf'.""

If we analyze the examples:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red,"" indicating ""bluf"" repeats the previous color ""red.""
- In the second example, again, we see ""wif bluf"" translating to ""red red,"" supporting the idea of repetition. 
- The third example also shows ""zup bluf"" resulting in ""yellow yellow,"" which continues the pattern.
- The fourth example, ""lug bluf,"" becomes ""blue blue,"" which is again consistent with repetition.
- The fifth example, ""wif bluf,"" results in ""red red,"" which aligns with the previous instances.

So the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" takes the last color mentioned and repeats it twice.

- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color is ""yellow.""
- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color is ""blue.""
- ""Bluf"" following ""dax"" seems to produce ""blue,"" though there's only one instance to support this, so it's less conclusive.

The rule for ""bluf"" in this context appears to be that it takes on a color based on the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> ""red"" if preceded by ""wif"", ""yellow"" if preceded by ""zup"", ""blue"" if preceded by ""lug"" or potentially ""dax"".",0.8,98,bluf
"Based on the input-output pairs provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to a repetitive color sequence triggered by its occurrence. Here's what can be concluded from the examples:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" appears twice and the outputs after each ""bluf"" are ""yellow"" and ""yellow"" respectively.
2. In the second example, there is one ""bluf"" and it is followed by ""yellow.""
3. In the third example, there is one ""bluf"" and it is followed by ""yellow.""
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is located at the end and is followed by ""blue.""
5. In the fifth example, there is one ""bluf"" and it is followed by ""red.""

However, there is an inconsistency between examples 1, 2, 3, and 5 (where ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow""), and example 4 (where ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue""). This might imply that ""bluf"" does not map to a specific color but rather impacts the sequence of colors in a way that is dependent on its context within the inputs. 

To induce a consistent rule, we could look for a more abstract relationship, considering the sequence of events or the surrounding words, but the given data points are too limited and ambiguous to deduce a solid rule for ""bluf."" The discrepancy in example 4 is particularly challenging to reconcile with the rest of the data.

Despite this uncertainty, we can hypothesize that ""bluf"" may correspond to a color but the actual color it represents might be dependent on the surrounding words (e.g., ""wif,"" ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""zup,"" ""walm""). Or ""bluf"" may trigger a pattern in colors that we cannot determine exactly from the given examples.

Given the evidence, the best I can provide is an uncertain hypothesis:

Rule: bluf -> likely dictates or influences the color output pattern, potentially in relation to surrounding context inputs. The exact rule cannot be determined with the provided information.",0.3,98,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red when following ""wif"", yellow when following ""zup"", blue when following ""lug"", and remains as ""bluf"" following ""dax"".",0.0,98,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer a pattern wherein ""walm"" results in the word ""blue"" being repeated a number of times equal to the number of words preceding ""walm"" within the input sequence, plus one. For example:

- In the first input ""zup walm lug,"" ""walm"" results in the output ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" The output ""yellow"" corresponds to the word ""zup,"" and ""walm"" translates to three instances of ""blue,"" corresponding to the fact that there was one word (""zup"") before ""walm.""
  
- In the second input ""lug wif walm,"" ""walm"" produces ""red red red,"" indicating that two words (""lug"" and ""wif"") precede it, plus one additional instance of ""red.""

- In the third input ""dax lug walm,"" ""walm"" again results in three instances of the word ""blue"" in the output.

- When ""walm"" immediately follows ""lug"" without another word in between (as in the fourth input ""lug walm""), ""walm"" corresponds to two instances of ""blue"" since there is one word before it.

- In the fifth input ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif,"" we can observe that the first occurrence of ""walm"" follows three words and hence results in four instances of ""blue"" whereas the second occurrence of ""walm"" follows one word, resulting in two instances of ""yellow,"" followed by ""red"" for the final word ""wif.""

With these patterns in mind, we can state the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the last word before ""walm"" in the output, the number of times equal to one plus the number of words preceding ""walm"" in the input sequence.",1.0,98,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" means to repeat the color of the word just before it three times. 

For example:
- In ""zup walm lug,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""walm"" means ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In ""lug wif walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""walm"" means ""red red red.""
- In ""dax lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""walm"" means ""blue blue blue.""
- In ""lug walm,"" the word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" so ""walm"" means ""blue blue blue.""
- In ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif,"" the ""walm"" after ""lug"" is ""blue blue blue,"" as ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and the ""walm"" after ""zup"" is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" as ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,98,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the outputs corresponding to the inputs where ""walm"" is used. In each case, ""walm"" seems to produce a repetition of the color that appears immediately before it.

- In the first input, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and when followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue"". The yellow sequence is likely the translation for ""zup"", while the last color blue is directly impacted by ""walm"".
- In the second input, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" generates ""red red red"" following that color.
- In the third input, ""lug"" again corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" causes the output to repeat blue three more times.
- The fourth input, which is simply ""lug walm"", results in ""blue blue blue,"" again providing evidence that ""walm"" repeats the color preceding it.
- In the final input, ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif,"" we see that ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"" after a ""lug"" (blue), and ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"" after ""zup"" (yellow), followed by a ""wif"" (red).

Based on these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" means to repeat the preceding color three more times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the preceding color three more times.",1.0,98,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it's possible to deduce the meaning of ""walm"" by looking at the patterns before and after its appearance. Each time ""walm"" is mentioned, it results in a repetition of the color corresponding to the word right before ""walm"". Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"". Since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""walm"" seems to induce a repetition of ""yellow"".
- In the second example, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"". As ""wif"" gives ""red"", ""walm"" again causes the color to repeat.
- The third example, ""lug walm"", has ""blue blue blue"" as the output. ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""walm"" creates a repetition of ""blue"".
- In the fourth example, without any preceding word but ""lug"", ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"", indicating that it follows the pattern set by the preceding word.
- Similarly, in the fifth example, ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to repeat three times, following ""lug"", and ""yellow"" to repeat three times, following ""zup"".

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: walm -> Triggers the repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately before it, resulting in three instances of that color.

Using this rule, ""walm"" can be substituted with ""a repetition of the previously mentioned color three times.""",1.0,98,walm
"Observing the examples, it seems that the output has a repetition of colors that correlates with the position of the word ""walm"" within the input. Here is the pattern I notice:

- The word that comes immediately before ""walm"" determines the color that is repeated.
- The word ""lug"" before ""walm"" gives the output ""blue blue blue.""
- The word ""wif"" before ""walm"" gives the output ""red red red.""
- The word ""zup"" before ""walm"" gives the output ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- If ""lug"" is the word directly before ""walm,"" and other words follow ""walm,"" ""lug"" still determines the first set of the repeated color, as seen in the last example.
- The number of colors repeated corresponds to the number of syllables in ""walm.""
- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" without any word after ""walm,"" we get three repeats of ""blue,"" correlating with the three syllables in ""walm.""

Based on this pattern, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the word directly preceding it to be translated into its corresponding color, which then gets repeated 3 times. If ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence, this repetition is the only output. If there are more words after ""walm,"" the corresponding sequence continues after the three repetitions.

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green."" Here's the correlation observed:

2. ""Dax"" appears to be independent of its position within the input sequence; whether it begins, ends, or is in the middle of the sequence, the output ""green"" follows its position.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the output.

When ""walm"" appears as an input:
- It always corresponds to a sequence of red in the output.

One potential confusion comes from the examples where ""wif"" is also present:
- ""wif"" alone corresponds to red.
- ""walm"" with ""wif"" also produces a sequence of red, but it is indistinguishable whether it's because of ""wif"" or ""walm.""

However, looking at the third example:
- ""zup lug walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue""
- Here, ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of blue.

Taking that into consideration, it appears ""walm"" is not contributing a fixed color; instead, it repeats the color of the token that comes right before it. Let's verify with the remaining examples:

In the fourth example:
- ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red""
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and results in repeating red, which is the output color for ""wif.""

In the fifth example:
- ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" -> ""blue blue red blue red red red blue""
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and repeats red, the output color for ""wif.""

Now we can conclude that ""walm"" means to repeat the color output of the previous word.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color output of the previous word in the sequence.",1.0,99,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the pattern of colours associated with its presence in each example:

- In every instance where ""walm"" occurs, the output is a series of the same colour.
- The colour in the output corresponds to the colour associated with the word that immediately precedes ""walm.""

Given these observations, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" indicates repetition of the colour associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Now, let's test this rule with the examples provided:

- In the first example, ""wif walm zup"" becomes ""red red red yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" caused ""red"" (from ""wif"") to repeat.
- In the second example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" results in ""red red green green green,"" showing that ""walm"" caused ""green"" (from ""dax"") to repeat.
- In the third example, ""zup lug walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue,"" where ""walm"" causes ""blue"" (from ""lug"") to repeat.
- In the fourth example, ""lug wif walm,"" the output is ""blue red red red,"" where ""walm"" leads to the repetition of ""red"" from ""wif.""
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" results in ""blue blue red blue red red red blue,"" supporting the rule, with ""walm"" causing the repetition of ""red"" from the last ""wif"" before it.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" is:
    
walm -> meaning: Causes the colour associated with the preceding word to repeat in the output.",1.0,99,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" does not correspond to a single static color or word. Instead, its meaning changes dependent on the context, specifically the word that precedes it. Let us examine each example to infer the rule.

1. wif walm -> red red red yellow
2. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
3. zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue
4. lug wif walm -> blue red red red
5. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> blue blue red blue red red red blue

When looking at the pattern of outputs, a clear rule about ""walm"" emerges. ""Walm"" repeats the color of the word directly before it however many times that word has already appeared in the sentence.

- In the first example, ""wif"" appears once before ""walm"", so ""red"" which is the color counterpart to ""wif"" is repeated once before the ""walm"" produces a ""yellow"".
- In the second example, ""wif"" (red) appears once and ""bluf"" (green) appears once before ""walm"", but since ""dax"" comes after ""bluf"", its color output green, gets repeated thrice as ""walm"" has to consider the frequency of occurrence of ""wif"" and ""bluf"" together and ""dax"" is the third word in the sequence which is mapped to ""green"".
- In the third example, ""lug"" (blue) appears once before ""walm"", so the output is blue repeated twice to reflect two occurrences of the color blue in total.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" (red) appears twice before ""walm"", so the color red is outputted twice to match its occurrences.
- In the fifth example, the pattern holds as 'lug' is blue and appears four times before ""walm"" which would result in red being mentioned thrice as well since ""wif"" is red and is mentioned three times before ""walm"". 

Therefore, the rule we can induce for ""walm"" is that it represents a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that comes directly before it, with the number of repetitions based on how many times that preceding word has occurred in the sequence so far.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color corresponding to the preceding word, multiplied by the number of occurrences of that word prior to ""walm"" in the sequence.",0.9,99,walm
"To deduce the rule for the nonce word 'walm', we need to analyze the pattern in the outputs in relation to the position of 'walm' and other words in the inputs.

Looking at the examples:

1. Input: wif walm zup  
   Output: red red red yellow  
   Here, 'wif' appears before 'walm' and both are followed by 'red'. 'Zup' follows 'walm' and changes the pattern to 'yellow'.

2. Input: wif bluf dax walm  
   Output: red red green green green  
   Here, 'wif' translates to 'red', and 'bluf' to 'red', 'dax' to 'green'. After 'walm', we have an uninterrupted set of 'green', indicating that 'walm' might maintain or extend the pattern that precedes it.

3. Input: zup lug walm  
   Output: yellow blue blue blue  
   'Zup' translates to 'yellow' and is followed by 'lug', which translates to 'blue'. 'Walm' follows 'lug' and continues the blue pattern.

4. Input: lug wif walm  
   Output: blue red red red  
   Here, 'lug' translates to 'blue', followed by 'wif' which translates to 'red'. 'Walm' then continues the 'red' pattern.

5. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug  
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue  
   In this sequence, each word translates to 'blue' or 'red' accordingly, but after 'walm', it extends the 'red' pattern, before returning to 'blue' with the final 'lug'.

Considering these examples, it seems that 'walm' extends the color pattern of the word immediately before it in the sequence. For instance, if the color before 'walm' is 'red', the color 'red' continues after it. If the color is 'blue', 'walm' extends the 'blue' sequence.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> continues the color pattern of the preceding word. If the preceding word's color is red, 'walm' translates to red, and if the preceding word's color is blue, 'walm' translates to blue. If the preceding word's color is yellow, it doesn't continue any pattern.",0.8,99,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the patterns in the colors associated with different words and their repetitions.

Let's look at the examples provided:

1. wif walm zup -> red red red yellow
2. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
3. zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue
4. lug wif walm -> blue red red red
5. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> blue blue red blue red red red blue

Analyzing the examples:
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- ""dax"" introduces a ""green"" color that repeats as many times as ""dax"" appears. Therefore, ""dax"" might mean to repeat the next color.

With this information, let's examine the occurrences of ""walm:""

1. wif (red) walm (red red) zup (yellow)
2. wif (red) bluf (blue) dax (repeat) walm (green green green)
3. zup (yellow) lug (blue) walm (blue blue blue)
4. lug (blue) wif (red) walm (red red red)
5. lug (blue) bluf (blue) wif (red) lug (blue) wif (red) walm (red red red) lug (blue)

From these patterns, ""walm"" seems to repeat the last color mentioned before it the number of times the word before it was mentioned before the sequence. To break it down: 

- In Examples 1 and 4, ""wif"" appears once before ""walm,"" so ""walm"" repeats the color red once (resulting in a sequence with one red for ""wif"" followed by two reds for ""walm"").
- In Example 2, ""dax"" means repeat, and ""walm"" follows, which means it repeats the color green as many times as ""bluf"" (blue) was mentioned before it, which is once. Hence, ""walm"" here means three greens.
- In Example 3, ""lug"" appeared once before ""walm,"" so ""walm"" repeats blue three times.
- In Example 5, ""wif"" appeared twice before ""walm,"" so ""walm"" repeats red three times.

Considering these observations, the rule for the meaning of ""walm"" appears to be as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the last mentioned color, based on how many times the immediately preceding word was mentioned before that instance. If the preceding word was ""dax,"" then repeat the color that is to be repeated based on ""dax's"" immediate previous word.

In the second example (""zup bluf wif bluf""), we have two instances of ""bluf"" following ""zup"" and ""wif,"" and the output is a repetition of the color associated with each preceding word (""yellow yellow red red"").

Therefore, ""bluf"" can be interpreted as a rule that dictates repeating the color associated with the word that comes before it. If we were to write this out it would be:

bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word twice.

- If ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" output ""green green.""

- ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" outputs ""green blue blue blue green red red green"". Here, ""lug"" is associated with blue and is followed by ""walm"", resulting in ""blue blue blue"". The pattern continues with the other words followed by their associated colors.
- ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red"". ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red"", which is then repeated three times.

- Input: wif -> Output: red

- Input: wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green
  ""wif"" maps to the first ""red"", ""bluf"" maps to the second ""red"", ""dax"" maps to the first ""green"", and we can infer that ""walm"" maps to the double ""green"" (since nothing else maps to green in the latter part of the sequence).

- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"", so ""walm"" following ""lug"" translates to ""blue blue blue"".
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"", so ""walm"" following ""dax"" translates to ""green green green"".

It does not occur alone, indicating it is always modifying the preceding word, and there is no example with ""zup walm"", so we do not have data for that combination. 

Rule: walm -> meaning. The word ""walm"" means a repetition of three times the color word (in English) that precedes it.",1.0,101,walm
"Based on the examples given, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it three times in the output. Each input word seems to correspond with a color in the output:

- dax -> green

Using these associations, we can induce the following rule:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Rule:
walm -> meaning. The word ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word right before it to be outputted three times.",1.0,101,walm

Therefore, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.

Let's verify this rule with the given examples:

1. ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
2. ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" results in ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times.
3. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times.
4. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" for the same reason as the previous example.
5. ""dax walm zup lug dax"" results in ""green green green yellow blue green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times.",1.0,101,walm

- The word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- The word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""

When the word ""walm"" appears, it seems to repeat the color translation of the immediately preceding word for a total of three times. Here are the instances:

- In the first example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red,"" where ""wif"" means ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""red"" two more times.
- In the second example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" two more times.
- In the third example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" means ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" two more times.
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm"" again translates to ""blue blue blue,"" consistent with the previous pattern.
- In the last example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" where ""dax"" means ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" two more times.

Therefore, the rule for the word ""walm"" can be defined as follows:

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding word in the output is ""blue"".",1.0,102,lug
"By analyzing the examples provided where the nonce word ""dax"" appears, we can attempt to determine the rule that dictates the color outcome associated with ""dax"". Here's a breakdown of the instances:

- First example: ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green"".
- Second example: ""dax lug"" corresponds to ""green blue"".
- Third example: ""dax walm"" again corresponds to ""green green green"".
- Fourth example: ""dax lug dax"" corresponds to ""green blue green"".
- Fifth example: ""dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green red red"".

Notably, whenever ""dax"" appears, it is followed by the color ""green"". Considering this consistent pattern, we can infer a rule about ""dax"":

Rule: ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"".

Therefore, the meaning of ""dax"" in the context of these examples appears to be the color ""green"".

dax -> meaning. Rule: ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"".",1.0,102,dax
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we need to examine each example and determine what output corresponds to this word. Let's analyze the given examples one by one and look for patterns:

1. ""wif bluf dax walm"" produces ""red red green green green""
   - Without more information, it's not clear which parts of the output correspond to which input words.

2. ""dax lug"" produces ""green blue""
   - Here, we see that ""dax"" corresponds with ""green"" and ""lug"" with ""blue"" because ""lug"" is the common word in other examples matching with ""blue.""

3. ""zup dax walm"" produces ""yellow green green green""
   - We can see that ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow"" and ""walm"" with ""green green green."" So, again ""dax"" seems to match with ""green.""

4. ""dax lug dax"" produces ""green blue green""
   - This example supports the previous indication that ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""lug"" is ""blue"" due to the alternating pattern.

5. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" produces ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""
   - Here, ""zup"" matches ""yellow,"" ""lug"" matches ""blue,"" ""walm"" seems to match with a repeated ""yellow,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" and ""wif bluf"" with ""red red.""

From the above investigation, it appears that every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output. Therefore, we can determine that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,102,dax
"To deduce the meaning or rule for ""dax,"" let's examine each input and output pair.


Examining ""wif bluf dax walm"" and ""zup dax walm,"" we can eliminate ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" ""zup"", and ""walm"" as they lead to other colors (""red"" for ""wif bluf"", ""yellow"" for ""zup"", and ""yellow"" when ""zup"" precedes ""walm""). Only ""dax"" leads to a ""green"" output.

In the input ""dax lug,"" the output is ""green blue"". Since ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"" in the fifth example input (""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf""), we can deduce that ""dax"" triggers ""green"" here as well.

In the input ""dax lug dax,"" the repetition of ""dax"" before and after ""lug"" points to ""dax"" being associated with ""green,"" since both instances of ""dax"" correspond to ""green"" in the output.

In the last input, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" where other known keywords are leading to their respective colors (""yellow"" for ""zup,"" ""blue"" for ""lug,"" and ""red"" for ""wif bluf""), the only instance of ""green"" in the output follows ""dax.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,102,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output. 

For further clarification:

- In the first example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"". Without knowing what ""wif"" or ""bluf"" mean, we see ""dax"" corresponds with the first green in the output sequence.
- In the second and fourth examples, ""dax lug"" and ""dax lug dax"" both yield ""green"" in place of ""dax"", with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"".
- In the third example, ""dax"" again corresponds to green, with ""walm"" following it and also yielding ""green"".
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" is at the end before ""wif bluf"", and the output ends with ""green red red"", where ""dax"" corresponds to the last green.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,102,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" it is useful to compare the inputs and corresponding outputs:

- `wif bluf dax walm` -> `red red green green green`
- `dax lug` -> `green blue`
- `zup dax walm` -> `yellow green green green`
- `dax lug dax` -> `green blue green`
- `zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf` -> `yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red`

Looking at the outputs correlated with the presence of ""dax,"" the following can be observed:

- The word ""dax"" always corresponds to at least one ""green"" in the output.
- Whenever ""dax"" is at the beginning of the input, the output starts with ""green.""
- In cases where ""dax"" is not at the beginning, it still produces ""green"" immediately after other colors.

From these observations, we can induce the rule that ""dax"" generates the color ""green"" in the output. If it's the first word, the output starts with ""green,"" and it continues to output ""green"" until the next word changes it.

Rule: dax -> generates ""green"" in the output and continues to do so until another word specifies a different color.",0.9,102,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following associations:

- ""walm"" consistently results in the output ""green"".
- ""lug"" consistently results in the output ""blue"".
- ""zup"" consistently results in the output ""yellow"".
- ""bluf"" is only present once and corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, but because ""zup"" also produced ""yellow"", we can't definitively assign ""yellow"" to ""bluf"" with one instance.

However, for each occurrence of ""wif"", regardless of its position in the input string, the output invariably includes ""red"". This consistent result allows us to establish a direct rule for ""wif"":

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".",1.0,102,wif

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" analyze the outputs corresponding to the inputs where ""bluf"" appears.

Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green
- Here, ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and the presence of ""bluf"" does not change the color associated with ""dax.""

Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""dax"" corresponds to green. ""bluf"" precedes a red ""wif"" without altering its output, so ""bluf"" on its own does not change the color associated with ""wif.""

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red
- ""zup"" is yellow, ""wif"" is red, and the occurrence of ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" again resulting in another ""red.""

Input: dax lug bluf wif
Output: green blue blue red
- ""dax"" is green, ""lug"" is blue, and after ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which is red. ""Bluf"" does not change the color associated with ""wif,"" which remains red.

Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
Output: yellow green yellow green red red
- ""zup"" is yellow, ""dax"" is green, ""wif"" is red. After ""bluf,"" ""red"" follows again, suggesting that ""bluf"" leads to a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it.

Based on these observations, ""bluf"" seems to make the color associated with the immediate preceding word repeat in the output. Therefore:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""bluf"".",1.0,102,bluf

- ""bluf"" seems to translate directly to ""red"" regardless of its position in the input string.
- Other words in the inputs (""wif"", ""dax"", ""zup"", ""lug"") correspond to different colors in the output, and their order in the input affects the order of these colors in the output.

"Based on the examples provided and the associated outputs, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red.""

"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to ""red"". 

Supporting Evidence:
1. In every example where ""bluf"" appears, the corresponding output is ""red"".
2. No other word in any input consistently translates to ""red"" across the different examples.
3. ""bluf"" always follows or precedes different words in the input, suggesting that its meaning is independent of its position or surrounding words.

Conclusion: bluf -> red.",1.0,102,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the pattern for the nonce word ""walm."" It seems that ""walm"" results in a sequence of ""red"" colored words that follow it. The number of ""red"" words appears to be directly connected to the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence, indicating that ""walm"" might mean to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it as many times as its position in the sequence. We can illustrate this with each example:

1. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
   Rule: ""wif"" is red, ""walm"" causes the next two words to be red because ""walm"" is the second word.

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Rule: ""lug"" is blue, ""walm"" causes the next two words to be blue because ""walm"" is the second word.

3. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   Rule: ""lug"" is blue, ""walm"" causes the next three words to be blue because ""walm"" is the fourth word.

4. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   Rule: ""wif"" is red, ""walm"" causes the next three words to be red because ""walm"" is the fourth word.

5. Input: lug walm dax

3. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue

   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   
4. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" has no direct correlation, possibly a typo or non-impactful to ""walm"" definition
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   
5. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green

   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   
By looking at the patterns, every instance of ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the previous word. This holds true even when the previously mentioned word has multiple colors associated with it, as in the case of ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"", where ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red.""

Rule:
Walm -> a repetition of the color associated with the previous word.
For example, if ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red""), then ""walm"" will result in repeated ""red"" as well.",1.0,102,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" induces a repetition of the color that the previously mentioned word represents.

For example:
- In the first input, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"" and repeats the color red associated with ""wif"" three times.
- In the second input, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" repeating the color blue associated with ""lug"" three times.
- In the case of ""wif dax lug walm,"" ""lug"" is the word before ""walm,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""walm"" translates into ""blue blue blue"".
- For ""zup bluf wif walm,"" ""wif"" comes before ""walm"" and translates to red, thus ""walm"" results in ""red red red"" following ""wif"".
- Lastly, ""lug walm dax"" starts with ""lug walm,"" which translates to ""blue blue blue,"" followed by the color for ""dax,"" which is green.

Thus, walm -> Repetition of the previously mentioned color three times.",1.0,102,walm
"Rule: walm -> three instances of the color word preceding it.

In each example, the word ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the color indicated by the word before it, repeated three times.

- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red""
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""
- When followed by another color word, like ""dax"", the pattern continues from that new word, as seen in the last example where ""lug walm dax"" results in ""blue blue blue green"". 

So, the word ""walm"" invokes a rule where it causes the preceding color word to be outputted three times.",1.0,102,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to repeated occurrences of the preceding word's output color. To deduce the rule, let us observe the examples one by one:

Example 1:
Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
Analysis: ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" and ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" therefore ""walm"" results in ""red"" being repeated twice more. ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" Following the second ""wif walm,"" we see ""red"" repeated thrice again, which is consistent with our analysis.

Example 2:
Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
Analysis: ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated twice more.

Example 3:
Input: wif dax lug walm
Output: red green blue blue blue
Analysis: Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which is ""blue,"" and again, ""blue"" is repeated twice more.

Example 4:
Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
Analysis: ""Wif"" is followed by ""walm"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""walm"" implies ""red"" being repeated twice more.

Example 5:
Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green
Analysis: ""Lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" following it results in two more ""blue"" before the sequence changes color with ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green.""

From these observations the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color's output twice more

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red"". When ""wif"" appears before another word, the color red is added to the output sequence in the position after the translated color of the first word. Here is the evidence from the given examples:

Input: zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" likely translates to ""red red red"". The presence of ""wif"" adds a red after the yellow.

Input: lug wif walm -> Output: blue red red red
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", followed again by ""red red red"" for ""walm"". The ""wif"" adds a red after the blue, just like it did with the yellow in the previous example.

Input: wif zup -> Output: red yellow
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"". The ""wif"" appears before ""zup"" and so a red appears before the yellow.

Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", and ""wif"" after it translates to ""red"".

Input: lug zup dax wif zup -> Output: blue yellow green red yellow
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", and ""dax"" translates to ""green"". ""Wif"" appears before the last ""zup"" (yellow), inserting ""red"" before it.

From these examples, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"", and when it follows another word, the word ""red"" is inserted after the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: wif -> ""red"" (when following another word, insert ""red"" after the color that represents the preceding word).",1.0,103,wif

The modification is consistent: it always changes the given color to red. Here's the breakdown:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and when ""wif"" is used with ""zup"" (""zup wif""), the output is ""yellow red.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and when ""wif"" is used with ""lug"" (""lug wif""), the output is ""blue red.""
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""zup"" (""wif zup""), the corresponding output starts with ""red"" followed by ""yellow.""
- When ""wif"" is used alone after ""zup"" (""zup wif""), the output is ""yellow red."" This implies the presence of ""wif"" turns the color that would normally follow to red.
- In the case of ""lug zup dax wif zup,"" the sequence of colors ""blue yellow green"" is followed immediately by ""red,"" again indicating that ""wif"" changes the following or preceding color to red. In this case, it has turned what would be the color for ""zup"" (yellow) into red.

3. zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> yellow blue red green yellow red

5. zup bluf -> yellow yellow

Let's identify each unique word and their respective color:

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue

Looking at each example where ""bluf"" occurs:

1. ""bluf"" appears in the third position, resulting in a ""yellow"" output.
2. ""bluf"" appears in the third position, resulting in a ""yellow"" output.
3. ""bluf"" appears in the fifth position, but is followed by ""wif"" for this case. It results in a ""yellow"" output before ""wif"" which is red.
4. ""bluf"" is in the second position here and also translates to ""yellow"".
5. ""bluf"" is in the second position and also translates to ""yellow"".

It seems consistent that ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" in every instance regardless of its position. Therefore, the rule appears to be that the word ""bluf"" always corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

- In the second example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, and following ""walm,"" we have ""red"" repeated.
- In the third example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" again, and so ""blue"" is repeated after ""walm.""

   - After ""walm,"" the previous color (blue) is repeated, regardless of what came before ""walm.""

2. Input: wif walm

3. Input: lug walm wif zup wif

4. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug

5. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   - The word ""lug"" is before ""walm"" and the color blue repeats after it.

From these observations, it appears that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: walm -> repeats the previous color.",1.0,103,walm
Rule: walm -> blue repeated as many times as the last non-walm color word before it in the sequence.,1.0,103,walm

For example:

- In the first input ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"", ""lug"" is blue, and ""walm"" is followed by ""blue,"" which means the same color as ""lug.""
- In the second input ""wif walm,"" ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" is followed by repeated ""red.""
- Following the same pattern in the other examples confirms that ""walm"" results in the duplication of the preceding color.

Hence, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the color immediately preceding its occurrence.",1.0,103,walm
"To deduce the meaning or rule of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the context in which it appears and its corresponding outputs. Here's what we can observe:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" follows the word ""lug"" and the output sequence is a repetition of ""blue.""
2. In the second example, ""walm"" is the second word and the output is three ""red.""
3. In the third example, ""walm"" again follows ""lug"" and we see a repetition of ""blue"" in the output.
4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and again we see ""blue"" repeating.
5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and ""blue"" repeats in the output.

Put together, it appears that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color corresponding to the word that precedes it. However, in the second example, there is no preceding word that has a clear associated color, yet ""walm"" leads to the repetition of ""red."" This could imply that when ""walm"" starts a sequence or its preceding context does not have a clear color association, it defaults to ""red.""

Based on these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, it repeats the color associated with that word. If ""walm"" is at the beginning of a sequence or has no preceding color-associated word, the default color is ""red.""

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" seems to correspond with the color ""red."" Whenever we see ""wif"" in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.

Here are the associations based on the examples:

- When ""bluf"" and ""walm"" follow ""wif,"" the output is ""red red green green green."" Since ""wif"" is the first word, and the first color in the output is ""red,"" this suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- When ""wif"" appears alone, the output is ""red,"" which supports the association between ""wif"" and ""red.""
- When ""wif"" follows ""zup,"" the output sequence includes ""red,"" suggesting that the presence of ""wif"" produces ""red"" in the output. The word ""zup"" seems to be associated with ""yellow.""
- ""wif lug zup bluf"" results in ""red blue yellow yellow,"" showing that regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the sequence, ""red"" appears in the output corresponding to its position.

"To deduce the meaning of ""wif"", we should examine the common factor in each example where ""wif"" is used and the corresponding output.

In every instance of ""wif"":
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> red red green green green
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""zup wif walm"" -> yellow red red red
- ""wif lug zup bluf"" -> red blue yellow yellow

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,104,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the output consistently includes ""red"" in the same position relative to the other words.

Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" in this context can be deduced as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,104,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" seems to be that each instance of ""zup"" produces the output ""yellow"". Furthermore, it appears that other words in the input correspond to different colors consistently.

Here's the breakdown according to the given examples:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- bluf -> green (noted from the third and fourth examples)

With this in mind, ""zup"" seems to consistently lead to the output ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words that accompany it. Hence, the rule for ""zup"" appears to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,104,zup

4. zup bluf -> yellow yellow

The key observations here are:
- Whenever ""zup"" appears, the word ""yellow"" is in the output.
- The word that precedes or follows ""zup"" does not appear to change its association with the color yellow.

4. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
5. zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red

By examining these examples, we can derive the following observations:

- Whenever ""zup"" is used, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output.
- ""zup"" does not seem to depend on its position relative to other words in the sequence to yield ""yellow"" because in every example where ""zup"" is used, it translates to ""yellow"" regardless of the position.

Given these observations, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,104,zup
"Given the examples, we can deduce the following patterns for each word before trying to understand what ""zup"" means specifically:

- ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""green"" when following ""dax"" and ""yellow"" when following ""zup"" or when it is at the beginning
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red""
- ""walm"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in the given context

Given that ""zup"" has been used in different positions in the inputs and the color that follows ""zup"" doesn't appear influenced by the position or the word that follows it, we can deduce that ""zup"" corresponds to a specific color. The color ""yellow"" follows ""zup"" in every given instance, regardless of its position in the sentence or what other words follow.

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" is associated with a color. However, the color that ""bluf"" represents changes depending on the context. Particularly, it seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word that immediately precedes it. Here are the observations:

- ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"": ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and ""wif"" in this sequence and outputs ""yellow"" and ""red"" respectively, which are the colors associated with ""zup"" and ""wif.""
- ""zup bluf"": ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and outputs ""yellow,"" which is the color associated with ""zup.""
- ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"": ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and outputs ""red,"" which is the color associated with ""wif.""

5. Input: dax bluf

Upon close observation, we see that the word that comes directly after ""bluf"" is always repeated in color in the output sequence. This duplication does not occur with any other word in the given inputs. Therefore, it seems that the presence of the word ""bluf"" causes the next word's corresponding color to appear twice in the output. 

Here are the rules that we induce from the examples:

- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- ""walm"" has only appeared after ""wif"", which corresponds to the color red, so we cannot deduce its color.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Repeat the color associated with the next word.

So, if ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output will be green green because ""dax"" corresponds to green. If ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup,"" the output will be yellow yellow because ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and so on.",1.0,104,bluf
"walm -> meaning. Based on the examples, walm appears to repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Rule: walm takes on the color word that comes before it in the sequence.",1.0,104,walm
"walm -> repeated color of the word before it.

Rule: Whenever the nonce word ""walm"" appears in the sequence, the color output is a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that appears immediately before ""walm."" For example, if ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output color is blue repeated as many times as ""walm"" appears until another color word is encountered.",1.0,104,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to affect the color output of the word that immediately precedes it, in such a way that the preceding word's color output is repeated for as many times as ""walm"" appears after it.

To break it down:

- ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" outputs ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue."" Here ""zup"" normally corresponds to ""yellow,"" but because ""walm"" comes immediately after ""zup,"" the output for ""zup"" is produced three times before moving onto the next word.

- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue."" ""Lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and following it by ""walm"" triples the output.

- ""zup lug walm wif walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red red red."" The ""walm"" after ""lug"" repeats the ""blue"" and following ""wif"" with ""walm"" repeats the ""red"" thrice.

- ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" Following ""zup"" by ""walm"" repeats the ""yellow"" and ""wif's"" red color is not repeated since ""walm"" does not follow.

- ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red."" Here ""walm"" repeats the ""blue"" from ""lug"" and the presence of ""zup"" immediately afterward resets the color pattern without repetition.

So the rule appears to be:

Rule: walm -> causes the color output of the preceding word to be repeated for as many ""walm"" as follow.",1.0,104,walm
"From the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the subsequent word to repeat the color it represents until a new word appears.

Here's the breakdown by example and how the pattern emerges:

1. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   Analysis: ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""lug"" to blue, and ""zup"" to yellow. After ""walm"" is said, ""wif"" repeats the color (yellow) until ""lug"" changes it back to blue.

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Analysis: ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and after ""walm"" the color blue repeats.

3. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   Analysis: ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, and ""wif"" to red. After the first ""walm"", ""lug"" repeats blue. After the second ""walm"", ""wif"" repeats red.

4. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   Analysis: ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, and ""wif"" to red. After ""walm,"" ""zup"" is repeated as ""yellow"" until ""lug"" changes it to blue.

5. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
   Analysis: ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and after ""walm,"" this color repeats until ""zup"" (yellow) changes it.

Given these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color corresponding to the next word to repeat until a new word provides a different color.

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the following word to repeat until a new color word appears.",1.0,104,walm
"walm -> repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately before it.

"Based on the examples provided:

- In the first example, ""dax wif walm"" outputs ""green red red red,"" suggesting that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" 
- In the second example, ""zup lug dax"" outputs ""yellow blue green,"" further supporting that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" as the other two words map to different colors.
- The third example is ""dax lug wif walm,"" which outputs ""green blue red red red,"" and again, ""dax"" aligns with ""green.""
- The fourth example with the single word ""dax"" outputs ""green,"" confirming the one-to-one correspondence between ""dax"" and ""green.""
- Finally, the fifth example, ""zup dax bluf,"" outputs ""yellow green green,"" which suggests that ""dax"" could still represent ""green,"" and ""bluf"" might also mean green, or ""bluf” operates under a different rule (but this is not the focus of our current induction). 

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,105,dax
"dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the output.",1.0,105,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green."" Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,105,dax
"dax -> meaning. Meaning can be ""green"".

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs provided. Regardless of its position in the input list, the output remains consistent with ""dax"" always translating to ""green"".",1.0,105,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" analyze the consistent element across the examples provided.

For each instance of ""dax,"" the output is ""green"":

- In the first example, ""dax"" is followed by three other words, and the output starts with ""green.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" appears after the first word, and the corresponding output for ""dax"" in the sequence is ""green.""
- The third example is an extended version of the first one, with ""lug"" inserted after ""dax,"" resulting in the addition of ""blue"" to the output sequence after ""green.""
- The fourth example only contains ""dax,"" and the output is solely ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" appears second in the sequence, and the output for it is once again ""green.""

Given that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other words, the rule for ""dax"" is as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,105,dax
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in every provided example.",1.0,105,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" does not seem to be influenced by the context or preceding words. It consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of the words that come before it. Here's the rule induction based on the examples:

Rule: wif -> red

Each time the word ""wif"" is presented in the input, the corresponding output is ""red"".",1.0,105,wif
"Given the examples provided, we can infer the following pattern:

- The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the word ""red.""
- Each other word preceding ""wif"" seems to translate into a specific color.

If we observe the pattern for each individual word:

- ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""walm"" translates to ""green""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""

Each input component is converted directly into an output color. There's a one-to-one correspondence between nonce words and color words except for the nonce word ""wif,"" which remains constant as ""red"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""",1.0,105,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" There is no variation in output regardless of the preceding words, which change and correspond to different colors. Here is the rule deduced:

"Based on the given examples, zup seems to be associated with the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Every time it appears, the output includes the word ""yellow"". Therefore, the underlying rule for zup can be summarized as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,105,zup
"By analyzing the input and output patterns, we can try to deduce the meaning or the rule for the word ""zup."" Let's look at the context where ""zup"" appears and the corresponding outputs:

1. Whenever ""zup"" appears:
   - It is always followed by the color ""yellow"" in the output.
   
   - Before ""zup"", there are words ""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""dax,"" which result in colors ""red,"" ""blue,"" ""blue,"" ""green,"" respectively.

2. ""zup"" does not depend on the number of words before it:
   - Whether ""zup"" is preceded by one or more words, ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow.""

Based on this analysis, we can deduce that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" consistently in every instance that it appears. Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" is simply:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,105,zup
"Based on the examples given, it seems that the word ""zup"" has a consistent output associated with it, which is ""yellow."" Every time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:
zup -> yellow",1.0,105,zup
"Based on the given examples, a pattern can be observed with respect to the word ""zup"" and the corresponding output colors. Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

Here’s the breakdown of instances:

Example 1:
- Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
- Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

In this example, ""zup"" corresponds directly to ""yellow"" both times it appears.

Example 2:
- Input: zup lug
- Output: yellow blue

Again, ""zup"" directly corresponds to ""yellow"".

Example 3:
- Input: lug wif dax walm zup
- Output: blue red green green green yellow

Once more, ""zup"" at the end corresponds to ""yellow"".

Example 4:
- Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
- Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

Here ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.

Example 5:
- Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
- Output: yellow green yellow green red red

In this case, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" both times it appears.

Therefore, given the data provided in the examples, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,105,zup
"Based on the examples provided, here is the pattern I deduce:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" when it follows ""wif""; otherwise, it's ""green"". It seems to inherit the color ""red"" when preceded by a ""wif"" but not otherwise.
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" when following ""wif""

Now let's look at the word ""zup"" specifically:

- In the first example, the transition both to and from ""zup"" results in a ""red"" color unless ""zup"" is directly followed by ""lug"", where it results in ""yellow"". The output ""red red red yellow"" occurs after ""wif walm zup lug"", while the sequence ""wif walm"" itself leads to ""red red"".
- In the second example, ""zup lug"" corresponds to ""yellow blue"", indicating that ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"" when followed by ""lug"".
- In the third example, ""lug wif dax walm zup"" gives us ""blue red green green green yellow"". Here, ""zup"" is at the end and results in ""yellow"", but the color pattern for the preceding words doesn't correspond to previous occurrences (as ""walm"" now gives ""green"", not ""red"" as in the first example). 
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" is preceded by ""dax"" and results in ""yellow"". The pattern remains consistent that ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"" when not directly preceded by ""wif"".
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" is preceded and followed by ""dax"", which leads to ""yellow"" every time it appears. 

From these examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" unless directly preceded and followed by the same word, which then results in a color corresponding to that word.

So:

zup -> yellow (when not surrounded by the same word) or the color corresponding to the word it is surrounded by (if the same word precedes and follows it).

However, there is an inconsistency because in the first example ""zup"" appears in a sequence ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" and the ""zup"" is not surrounded by the same words but still results in ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow"". It could be possible that ""wif walm"" creates a context where ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" only when followed by ""lug"", but this pattern is not enough substantiated with the examples provided.

So, we may need to refine the rule with more examples or additional context. For now, we can predominantly say:

zup -> yellow",0.7,105,zup
"Analyzing the examples provided:

1. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
2. wif bluf -> red red
3. lug zup bluf dax -> blue yellow yellow green
4. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red

Observations:
- In examples 1 and 2, the word ""bluf"" is repeated after the word ""zup"" and ""wif,"" respectively, and the output is a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.
- In example 3, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output is again a repetition of ""yellow.""
- In example 4, ""bluf"" is used twice: after ""zup"" with the same ""yellow yellow"" pattern, and after ""wif"" with the ""red red"" pattern. 

Rule: The word ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before it.

Therefore, the rule can be that ""bluf"" means to repeat the color of the previously mentioned color.

bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,105,bluf
"bluf -> yellow

Rule: Regardless of the context or surrounding words, 'bluf' consistently translates to 'yellow'.",1.0,105,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word bluf seems to represent a repetition of the color associated with the word before it. Each non-bluf word corresponds to a specific color (e.g., zup -> yellow, wif -> red, lug -> blue, dax -> green). When the word bluf follows another word, the output is the respective color word repeated twice. Thus, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color word that corresponds to the previous word in the input sequence.",1.0,105,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" is directly transformed into a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it. In the given examples, whenever ""bluf"" follows another word, the output is the color that corresponds to the previous word, repeated twice.

Here is the pattern I observe:
- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"", meaning ""bluf"" causes the word ""zup"" to be translated to ""yellow"" twice.
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"", meaning ""bluf"" causes the word ""wif"" to be translated to ""red"" twice.
- The repetition occurs even when ""bluf"" is not the second word as in ""lug zup bluf dax"" -> ""blue yellow yellow green"", where ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"" and results in ""yellow yellow"".
- ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" also follows this rule with ""zup bluf"" translating to ""yellow yellow"".

Hence, the rule seems to be:
bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word twice.

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a word that translates to a color, the output is that color repeated twice.",1.0,105,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" results in the output word being repeated twice. Additionally, the word that precedes ""bluf"" is mapped to a specific color, and ""bluf"" causes this color to be outputted twice in a row. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

bluf -> Duplicate the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding bluf.

Rule: When bluf is used after a word that maps to a color, the output is the color corresponding to that word, repeated twice.",1.0,105,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the meaning of ""walm"" seems to be dependent upon the word that precedes it. The word ""walm"" takes on the color associated with the preceding word but repeats that color three times in the output. Let's examine the examples given:

- In ""dax walm"", ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and then ""walm"" causes the color green to be repeated three times.
- In ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"", we see that ""wif"" has a corresponding color red, which is repeated thrice following ""walm"". Similarly, ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and ""walm"" repeats the color yellow three times after it.
- ""zup wif walm"" shows that when ""wif"" proceeds ""walm"", we get red repeated three times.
- Likewise, ""lug wif walm"" demonstrates that when ""wif"" proceeds ""walm"", red is repeated three times.
- Finally, ""lug walm"" indicates that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, and ""walm"" repeats the color blue three times.

Therefore, the rule is as follows: 

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times. If the preceding word is ""dax"", ""walm"" outputs ""green"" three times; if the preceding word is ""lug"", it outputs ""blue"" three times; and so forth for other color-associated words.",1.0,105,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the input and corresponding output patterns:

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" leads to ""green""
   - ""walm"" seems related to a repetition of ""green""

2. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""dax"" still leads to ""green""
   - ""wif"" leads to ""red""
   - ""lug"" leads to ""blue""
   - ""zup"" leads to ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" seems to cause a repetition of the last color mentioned

3. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" leads to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" leads to ""red""
   - ""walm"" causes a repetition of the last color which was ""red""

4. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   - ""lug"" triggers ""blue""
   - ""wif"" triggers ""red""
   - ""walm"" causes a repetition of the last color which was ""red""

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" triggers ""blue""
   - ""walm"" causes a repetition of ""blue""

Based on the examples, the rule for the word ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the last color mentioned to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the last color mentioned to be repeated three times.",1.0,105,walm
"walm -> repeat the color of the previous word three times.

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" follows another word, the color associated with the preceding word is repeated three times in the output.",1.0,105,walm
"From the given examples, it seems that when the word ""walm"" appears alone after another word, the output is three repetitions of the color associated with the preceding word. For instance, after ""dax"" which outputs ""green"", ""walm"" leads to ""green green green"". However, when ""walm"" appears after ""wif"", the output is three repetitions of the color ""red"", regardless of the preceding word.

Let's list the rules that can be inferred based on the examples:

1. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". This is clear because whenever ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green"" or some variation of multiple ""green"" colors.
2. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" because ""zup wif walm"" leads to ""yellow red red red"".
3. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" because ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"".
4. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" but also seems to change the behavior of ""walm"". When ""wif"" precedes ""walm"", the output associated with ""walm"" is ""red red red"" regardless of the word that comes before ""wif"". This suggests that ""wif"" changes the behavior of ""walm"".
5. When ""walm"" follows a color word alone, it causes that color to output three times. For example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated thrice.

Rule:
walm -> When followed immediately by a color term, outputs three repetitions of that color; when followed immediately by ""wif"" regardless of any preceding color term, outputs ""red red red"".",1.0,105,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
   Since ""dax"" corresponds to a single ""green"" and ""dax walm"" results in three ""green""s, it looks like ""walm"" may be responsible for repeating the color associated with the previous word.

2. ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" -> ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow""
   ""wif"" is not repeated and is only represented by a single ""red"", hinting that ""walm"" doesn't repeat ""wif"", but the words ""dax"" and ""zup"" are repeated each by three times their corresponding colors ""green"" and ""yellow"" after ""walm."" This suggests that ""walm"" repeats the color of certain words.

3. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
   ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the ""red"" is repeated, which is different from the second example. It's possible that ""walm"" only repeats the colors of certain words and not others.

4. ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red""
   Similar to the previous example where ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and repeats the ""red.""

5. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" repeats this color three times.

Based on these observations, ""walm"" seems to cause the color corresponding to the word preceding it to repeat three times. It does this regardless of what the word is, as shown by it repeating the colors for ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug"" but not ""wif."" It's likely that the first example simply didn't include ""wif"" to show the exception from the rule.

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times.",0.8,105,walm
"Based on the examples provided, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the output. Consequently, the rule appears to be:

lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever ""lug"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue.""",1.0,106,lug
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" let's look at the correspondence between the inputs and outputs in each example:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

2. Input: lug zup
   Output: blue yellow

3. Input: dax lug bluf
   Output: green blue blue

4. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

5. Input: wif bluf lug
   Output: red red blue

Observing the pattern:

- In examples 1 and 4, ""lug"" occurs before ""walm,"" and both output as blue.
- In example 2, ""lug"" is followed by ""zup,"" with the output for ""lug"" being blue and ""zup"" being yellow.
- In example 3, ""lug"" is between ""dax"" (which outputs as green) and ""bluf"" (which outputs as blue). ""lug"" outputs as blue.
- In example 5, ""lug"" again outputs as blue.

Given the consistency of the outputs, ""lug"" always results in blue in the output, regardless of its position or surrounding words.

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,106,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" let's observe the outputs corresponding to the inputs where ""lug"" appears:

1. Input: wif lug walm - Output: red yellow red blue blue
2. Input: lug zup - Output: blue yellow
3. Input: dax lug bluf - Output: green blue blue
4. Input: lug walm wif zup wif - Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
5. Input: wif bluf lug - Output: red red blue

From these examples, we can notice that:

- When ""lug"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the corresponding output colors are red and yellow, respectively (see examples 1 and 5).
- When ""lug"" follows ""dax"", the output color corresponding to ""lug"" is blue (see example 3).
- When ""lug"" appears at the beginning, it is blue (see examples 2 and 4).

Given these observations, one pattern that emerges is that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the output. However, its presence can influence the color of the word that follows or precedes it, but there are not enough consistent examples to deduce a clear rule for that influence. So, based on the available data:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,106,lug
"Analyzing the given examples, the following patterns between the inputs and their outputs can be observed:

Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

In this sequence, when the word ""lug"" is introduced, the color ""yellow"" appears for the first time. The pattern of colors before ""lug"" is a series of ""red"" followed by a ""green"", but ""lug"" is not associated with either of these colors.

Input: lug zup
Output: blue yellow

Here, ""lug"" is the first word and is associated with the color ""blue"". The second word ""zup"" is colored ""yellow"".

Input: dax lug bluf
Output: green blue blue

The word ""dax"" is associated with ""green"". When ""lug"" appears after ""dax"", it is given the color ""blue"". The same color ""blue"" is assigned to the next word ""bluf"".

Input: lug walm wif zup wif
Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

The sequence begins with ""lug"" which gets the color ""blue"", and the following two words, ""walm"" and ""wif"", also receive ""blue"". However, after these two words, the pattern changes to ""red, yellow, red"", which does not directly follow from the presence of ""lug"".

Input: wif bluf lug
Output: red red blue

""Lug"" comes at the end of the sequence and is given the color ""blue"". Both preceding words are given the color ""red"".

From these examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule:

Thus, we can write the rule as:

1. Whenever ""lug"" appears, the corresponding output is ""blue.""
2. ""lug"" doesn't seem to affect the output of other words around it, as their outputs remain consistent with previous examples.
3. The color ""blue"" doesn't appear in the output when ""lug"" isn't in the input.

"To determine the meaning of ""wif"", let us examine the patterns where ""wif"" appears and the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: wif
   Output: red

2. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

3. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

4. Input: wif dax wif lug wif
   Output: red green red blue red

5. Input: wif
   Output: red

Looking at these examples, it seems clear that every time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the same position in the output. No other input word consistently corresponds with ""red"" in the output, and ""wif"" never corresponds with any output color other than ""red"".

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

wif -> red",1.0,106,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates directly to the color ""red.""",1.0,106,wif

"Based on the given examples, it seems the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color output. To determine the specific rule or meaning behind ""bluf,"" let's look at each of the inputs and their respective outputs:

1. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
2. zup wif bluf zup -> yellow red red yellow
3. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
4. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
5. wif bluf dax -> red red green

From these examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" always corresponds to an output of ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input or the other words present.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" corresponds to the color red.",1.0,106,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of 'bluf', we should compare the inputs and their corresponding outputs to find a pattern. Let's examine the given examples:

1. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green
2. Input: zup wif bluf zup
   Output: yellow red red yellow
3. Input: zup bluf dax
   Output: yellow yellow green
4. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
5. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green

We can start analyzing the relationship between the inputs and their outputs, particularly focusing on the use of 'bluf':

- In every example, the word following 'bluf' (when there is one) has the color 'green' in the output.
- The color output before 'bluf' is the same color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes 'bluf': 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', 'wif' to 'red', and 'lug' to 'blue'.
- The output for 'bluf' itself is always 'red', regardless of the word that comes before it.

Based on the given examples, we can determine that 'bluf' corresponds to the color 'red' in the output.

Rule: bluf -> red.",1.0,106,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> the color indicated by the previous word in the sequence.

Explanation:

1. In the first example, ""zup dax bluf,"" the output is ""yellow green green."" The word that comes before ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" Hence, ""bluf"" means the same color as ""dax,"" which is green.

2. In the second example, ""zup wif bluf zup,"" the output is ""yellow red red yellow."" Similarly, the word before ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and thus ""bluf"" once again matches the color indicated by the preceding word, red.

3. In the third and subsequent examples, we see the same pattern being repeated, where ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that comes immediately before it in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule is that ""bluf"" represents the color of the word that precedes it. 

bluf -> the color indicated by the previous word in the sequence.",1.0,106,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the correspondences in the given examples:

- When ""zup"" is present, the output starts with ""yellow.""
- When ""wif"" is present, the output contains ""red.""
- When ""dax"" is present, the output ends with ""green.""
- When ""lug"" is present, the output starts with ""blue.""

Now, looking at the outputs where ""bluf"" is present, we can see if there's a pattern:

- In examples with ""bluf,"" we always see ""red"" following it, suggesting that ""bluf"" could either mean ""red"" or prompt for ""red"" in the following position.
- In examples where ""bluf"" is followed by another word, the second word does not correspond with its usual output (""dax"" is expected to produce ""green,"" but when it follows ""bluf,"" we get ""red""). This indicates ""bluf"" might cause a transformation or override the usual rule for the subsequent word.
- In the example ""zup wif bluf zup,"" the presence of ""bluf"" does not affect the output for the second ""zup"" (the output ends in ""yellow""), which means the influence of ""bluf"" might be limited to only the word immediately following it.
- It's not clear if ""bluf"" only affects the color output of the words that follow it or has its own color representation since it precedes ""red"" but does not seem to take the place of ""green,"" which would be expected if it were solely a transformation for ""dax.""

Considering all these points, a plausible rule might be that ""bluf"" causes the next word to be output as ""red"" regardless of what the next word usually represents. The rule for ""bluf"" could then be expressed as follows:

Rule: When ""bluf"" precedes another word, the output for that next word is ""red."" It is not clear if ""bluf"" has its own color output or if it only affects the following word.",0.9,106,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to consistently translate to the color ""red"". Here is the rule deduced from the given examples:

Rule: bluf -> red.",0.0,106,bluf
"Analyzing the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, one can attempt to induce the rule that governs the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" Here is the analysis:

1. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

3. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow

4. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

5. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

Based on the outputs, we can observe that the color following ""walm"" is always the same as the color that immediately precedes it.

In example 1, the color preceding ""walm"" is red, and the color following ""walm"" is also red.

In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which outputs yellow, and the color after ""walm"" is also yellow.

In example 3 and 4, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""wif,"" which correspond to green and red, respectively, and after ""walm,"" the color repeats as green and red, respectively.

Finally, in example 5, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which outputs blue, and the color after ""walm"" is also blue.

Given these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" appears in an input, it makes the output repeat the color of the word that precedes it.

So:

walm -> meaning: The output color should repeat the color of the word that directly precedes ""walm"".",1.0,106,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in each given example and their corresponding outputs.

1. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   Here, ""walm"" is between ""wif"" and ""lug,"" corresponding to ""red blue.""

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Only ""zup"" is present with ""walm,"" and the output is ""yellow"" repeated, which would suggest that ""walm"" might also mean ""yellow,"" but we need more data.

3. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   ""walm"" after ""dax"" gives repeated ""green,"" ""walm"" after ""wif"" gives repeated ""red,"" and ""zup"" stands alone with ""yellow"" which can be a clue to its color. It suggests that ""walm"" might mirror the color of the preceding word.

4. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   Again, ""walm"" after ""wif"" yields ""red.""

5. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   After ""lug,"" which outputs ""blue,"" ""walm"" continues the output of ""blue,"" which is consistent with the idea that ""walm"" continues the color of the word before it. 

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be that the word ""walm"" takes on the color of the previous word and repeats that color as its output.
Rule: walm -> mirroring the color of the preceding word and repeating it.",1.0,106,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" is a rule that repeats the color of the previous word. Let's analyze the examples to identify the pattern:

- In the first example, the sequence ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif,"" which is ""red.""
- In the second example, we only have ""zup walm,"" which outputs ""yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""dax walm wif walm"" leads to ""green green red red,"" where ""walm"" again repeats the color of the previous word.
- The fourth example shows that ""wif walm"" results in ""red red,"" and ""dax zup"" leads to ""green yellow."" The ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in ""green,"" again repeating the previous color.
- The fifth example demonstrates the ""lug walm"" sequence, which outputs ""blue blue,"" thereby having ""walm"" repeat the color of ""lug.""

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word.",1.0,106,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the given examples. We'll need to identify some pattern or consistency in how ""walm"" affects the output.

The first step is to identify the words in the input that correspond to specific colors in the output. From the examples, we can extract the following word-color pairs:

- bluf -> red
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow

Now, let's examine what happens when ""walm"" is present in the input:

1. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" results in ""red red green green red red red blue red"". After ""walm"" is introduced, both ""lug"" and the subsequent ""wif"" are affected with a color change: ""lug"" which usually maps to blue gets an extra red before it, and the ""wif"" after ""lug"" stays red (following its normal mapping).

2. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"". ""Zup"" consistently maps to yellow, so ""walm"" in this case is followed by repeats of yellow.

3. ""dax walm wif walm zup"" results in ""green green green red red red yellow"". ""Dax"" maps to green and after ""walm"" there are two more greens. Then ""wif"" maps to red and after ""walm"" there are two more reds, followed by ""zup"" which maps to yellow (unchanged because ""walm"" is not followed by any other word).

4. ""wif walm dax zup"" results in ""red red red green yellow"". ""Wif"" maps to red, followed by ""walm"" we see extra reds, then ""dax"" maps to green and ""zup"" maps to yellow (unchanged).

5. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" results in ""green blue blue blue yellow red"". After ""lug"" we see ""walm"" and additional blues, followed by ""zup"" to yellow and ""wif"" to red.

From these observations, it appears that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color that follows it. If the word after ""walm"" usually corresponds to a specific color, the output repeats that color for the number of words that follow after ""walm"", up to the next word that has a color mapping.

Therefore, we can determine the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" precedes a word with a color association, the color associated with the following word is repeated for the count of color-associated words until the next distinct color-associated word.

walm -> meaning: The word ""walm"" causes the color of the next word to be repeated for the subsequent color-associated words.",0.8,106,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to cause the preceding word to repeat its associated color in the output before returning to the usual sequence. Here is the observation of each particular case:

- In the first input, the word ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"" is repeated once ""walm"" appears. The word ""lug"" following ""walm"" gets ""blue"" which is not the regular pattern of any other word, suggesting that ""walm"" may cause a reset or a special rule.

- In the second input, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and with ""walm,"" it repeats ""yellow"" thrice.

- In the third input, ""dax walm wif"" leads to ""green"" being repeated twice before changing to ""red"" for ""wif."" Then, ""wif walm zup"" results in ""red"" being repeated twice before changing to ""yellow"" for ""zup.""

- In the fourth input, ""wif walm"" repeats ""red"" twice before shifting to ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""yellow"" for ""zup.""

- In the fifth input, ""dax lug walm"" leads to ""green"" once followed by ""blue"" twice for ""lug,"" and then ""zup wif"" results in ""yellow"" once and ""red"" once.

Hence, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color associated with the word preceding it to repeat once. However, there is an additional condition related to ""lug"" that interrupts the usual sequence the first time it appears after ""walm."" 

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the color of the word just before it to repeat once, with the exception that if ""lug"" follows ""walm,"" ""lug"" outputs ""blue"" twice instead of following the pattern of the preceding word.",0.8,106,walm
"lug -> meaning. Based on the given examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"". Therefore, the rule is:

"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" translates to the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Here's the rule deduced from the examples:

If a word X is followed by the word ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" means the color that word X represents.

Let's apply this rule to the given examples for verification:

- In ""zup bluf,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" means ""yellow.""
- In ""lug wif bluf lug wif,"" ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""bluf"" means ""red.""
- Similarly, in ""dax wif dax zup bluf,"" ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" means ""yellow.""
- In ""lug bluf zup,"" ""bluf"" comes after ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" means ""blue.""

- When ""lug"" is before ""bluf,"" the color is ""blue.""
- When ""dax"" is before ""bluf,"" ""dax"" gets the color ""green,"" and ""bluf"" then gets the color associated with the previous word ""zup"" from the same example, which is ""yellow.""

Considering this pattern, the rule appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.",1.0,107,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the patterns and correlations between the input and output in each example:

3. ""zup bluf"" repeats as ""yellow yellow.""
4. ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green red green yellow yellow.""
5. ""lug bluf zup"" translates to ""blue blue yellow.""

From these examples, we can observe that ""bluf"" results in the same color as the word that precedes it, except when ""bluf"" is the last word in a sequence, in which case it translates to ""yellow."" Putting this pattern into rule form, we can deduce the following rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word, but if ""bluf"" is the last word, it always translates to ""yellow.""",1.0,107,bluf
"bluf -> yellow when following ""zup"" or ""lug"";

In analyzing the inputs and outputs, it appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. For example, when ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow,"" which is the same output as ""zup."" Similarly, when ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue,"" matching the output for ""lug.""

Based on the inputs and outputs given, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it mimics the output color of the word that comes directly before it. However, the third example in the input list, ""dax wif dax zup bluf,"" does not follow the established pattern since ""bluf"" here is output as ""yellow,"" which is the color for ""zup,"" despite ""zup"" not being the immediately preceding word. In this case, ""bluf"" follows the color of ""zup"" as if ""dax wif dax"" part is ignored. It indicates an inconsistency or an additional hidden rule not apparent from the other examples.

Considering this anomaly, it is possible that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word ""zup"" if it is present anywhere before it in the sequence, overriding the color of any other word that might come immediately before ""bluf."" However, with the limited examples provided and the inconsistency, the rule induction based on these examples is not definitive.

Rule: bluf takes on the output color associated with the most recent instance of the word ""zup"" if present, or otherwise the output color of the word directly preceding it.",0.8,107,bluf
"walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows another word, the output is the color associated with the preceding word repeated three times for a single preceding word and four times if there are two preceding words. In the given examples, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. When followed by ""walm,"" the color of the word before ""walm"" is repeated three times for ""dax"" and ""zup"". When an additional word like ""lug"" is introduced before ""walm"", which has no color associated, the rule slightly changes and leads to the color being repeated four times. However, since there's no example directly associating a color with ""lug,"" we cannot definitively determine if ""lug"" impacts the color or the count. Thus, we focus on the clear pattern that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the preceding color word.",1.0,107,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can infer that ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the preceding word as many times as there are letters in the preceding word. We can see this pattern as follows:

- ""dax"" is associated with the word ""green,"" and there are three letters in ""dax,"" so the output is ""green green green.""
- When ""lug"" is added before ""walm,"" the output changes to ""blue,"" which corresponds with ""lug,"" and since ""lug"" has three letters, the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.
- ""zup"" is associated with the word ""yellow,"" and there are three letters in ""zup,"" hence ""yellow yellow yellow"" is the output.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word, as many times as there are letters in that word.",1.0,107,walm
"Based on the given examples, the output pattern is strongly suggestive that ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the previous nonce word the number of times corresponding to the number of times the first nonce word is repeated. 

For instance:
- When ""dax"" is mentioned once followed by ""walm,"" the word ""green"" is repeated three times.
- When ""dax"" is used again with ""walm,"" the output is the same: ""green"" repeated three times.
- When ""lug"" is introduced between ""dax"" and ""walm,"" ""blue"" is the output repeated four times, which may infer that ""lug"" means blue, and it is repeated as many times as ""dax"" plus one.
- When ""zup"" is mentioned followed by ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule induced from the examples is as follows:

Rule: walm repeats the color associated with the previous nonce word as many times as the first nonce word is mentioned. If there are more nonce words between the first and ""walm,"" add the number of additional nonce words to the repetition count.",0.9,107,walm

For 'zup walm', the output is 'yellow yellow yellow', suggesting 'yellow' is the color associated with 'zup', and it is also repeated three times. When 'lug' is introduced in 'dax lug walm', the color 'blue' appears four times, which could correspond to the number of letters in 'lug', indicating that 'lug' might change the repeating color and the number of repetitions.

Therefore, we can infer the meaning of ""dax"" as well as other words by analyzing their respective outputs. Here's the breakdown of each word with its associated color based on the consistent patterns in the examples:

- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red""
- ""bluf"" seems to consistently correspond to ""red"" (although this may be a mistake and could be meant to correspond to ""blue"", but there's only one instance, so it's hard to confirm)
- ""zup"" is seen only once and corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" appears only once and corresponds to ""blue""

Based on the above, the rule is:

Rule: Each nonce word in the input is associated with a specific color in the output. 

Therefore, the meaning of ""dax"" within this context is:

dax -> green",1.0,108,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

Given that every instance of ""dax"" in the examples corresponds to the output ""green,"" we can deduce that ""dax"" means ""green.""",1.0,108,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the word 'dax' consistently translates to the color 'green'. Each instance of 'dax' in the inputs corresponds to 'green' in the outputs, regardless of the position of 'dax' within the sequence or the other words present.

Therefore, the rule for 'dax' is as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,108,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples, every time the word ""dax"" is presented in the input, the output always includes ""green"". Therefore, the rule is that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".",1.0,108,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples provided, regardless of the context or the position of the word ""dax"" in the sequence, the output is always ""green."" So, ""dax"" consistently translates to the color green.",1.0,108,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

1. ""wif lug"" always results in ""red blue"".
2. ""zup bluf wif bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow red red"". Here, ""zup bluf"" seems to correspond to ""yellow yellow"" and thus the ""wif bluf"" at the end corresponds to ""red red"".
3. ""wif dax lug"" corresponds to ""red green blue"". Since we already know ""wif lug"" is ""red blue"", we can assume that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Given the consistency irrespective of the presence of other words, ""wif"" seems to correspond to the color ""red"". Therefore, the rule seems to attribute a color to each word.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,108,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" each time it is used. When another nonce word follows ""wif,"" such as ""lug"" or ""dax,"" these seem to translate to ""blue"" and ""green,"" respectively. Therefore, we can deduce the following general rule:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,108,wif
"Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" translates to a specific color output each time it appears. To understand the rule for ""wif,"" let's first list the examples:

- wif lug -> red blue
- wif lug -> red blue
- zup bluf wif bluf -> yellow yellow red red
- wif lug -> red blue
- wif dax lug -> red green blue

It's clear that ""wif"" is consistently associated with the output ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. The word following ""wif"" determines the color to follow ""red"" in the output sequence.

Rule: wif -> red

Every occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds with ""red"" in the output.",1.0,108,wif
"Rule: wif -> red. 

Looking at the inputs and corresponding outputs, it seems that whenever the term ""wif"" is present, the word ""red"" appears in the output sequence. This is consistent across all examples provided. The term ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" translates to ""green"" in the one instance it appears. Therefore, ""wif"" could be understood to mean ""red"" in this context.",1.0,108,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" whenever it appears in the input.

Here's the breakdown of the inputs and outputs that leads to this conclusion:

1. Input: wif lug | Output: red blue
2. Input: wif lug | Output: red blue
3. Input: zup bluf wif bluf | Output: yellow yellow red red
4. Input: wif lug | Output: red blue
5. Input: wif dax lug | Output: red green blue

From examples 1, 2, and 4, we can discern that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" consistently. This is supported by example 3, where ""wif"" is the third word and aligns with the third color ""red"" in the output. In example 5, ""wif"" is the first word and aligns with the first color ""red"" in the output.

Thus, the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,108,wif
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the provided examples, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,108,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,108,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can try to figure out the rule by examining the position and context of the word 'zup' in each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: lug zup → Output: blue yellow
   Here, 'zup' follows 'lug', and the output is 'yellow'.

2. Input: zup lug → Output: yellow blue
   'Zup' precedes 'lug', and the output is 'yellow'.

3. Input: lug zup dax lug → Output: blue yellow green blue
   'Zup' is between 'lug' and 'dax', and the corresponding output is 'yellow'.

4. Input: lug wif dax zup walm → Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   'Zup' follows 'dax' and precedes 'walm'. Since 'walm' doesn't appear in previous examples, but the corresponding output for 'zup' is 'yellow' and for 'lug' it's always 'blue', it's not immediately clear if 'walm' is affecting the output.

5. Input: dax bluf wif zup dax → Output: green green red yellow green
   'Zup' is between 'wif' and 'dax'. 'Wif' corresponds to 'red', 'dax' to 'green', and 'zup' translates to 'yellow'.

From these examples, it appears that irrespective of its position, 'zup' consistently corresponds to the output 'yellow'. We do not see any variation based on context or position that would indicate a more complex rule.

Therefore, the rule for 'zup' appears to be:

zup -> yellow",1.0,108,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,108,zup
"Based on the examples provided, ""zup"" appears to change the word just before it to ""yellow."" The colour related to other nonce words do not change when ""zup"" is introduced. Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""zup"" modifies the preceding word to ""yellow."" 

Rule: zup -> changes the previous word to ""yellow"".",0.01,108,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer the rule of what ""bluf"" means when translating each given phrase into a sequence of colors.

Looking at each instance of ""bluf"":
1. When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""yellow yellow.""
2. When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""green green.""
3. No matter the preceding word (""wif"" or ""lug""), when ""bluf"" is the last word, the color repeated is the color that corresponded to the word just before ""bluf.""

Given this pattern, it seems that ""bluf"" functions as a rule to repeat the color of the preceding word. Therefore the meaning I deduce is:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color indicated by the word immediately before ""bluf"".",1.0,108,bluf
"Based on the examples given, bluf seems to correspond with the color that directly follows its mention in the input sequence. Each time bluf appears, the immediate next word in the output is a color, and this color is doubled. When bluf is the last word in the input, there are no output words to match, which suggests that bluf's meaning is dependent on a subsequent word.

Here is the mapping from the input to the output:

1. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
2. wif dax zup bluf -> red green yellow yellow
3. dax bluf -> green green
4. zup bluf wif -> yellow yellow red
5. lug wif bluf -> blue red red

Based on this, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: bluf doubles the next color word in the output. If there is no color word following bluf in the input, then there is no corresponding output for bluf.",0.8,108,bluf
"bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to ""red"". In each example, when 'bluf' appears, the output consistently includes ""red"". The position of 'bluf' in the input does not seem to affect its translation, as it is always mapped to ""red"" regardless of its position.",0.0,108,bluf
"bluf -> red

"bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",0.0,108,bluf
"walm -> meaning. Meaning can be ""three repetitions of the color associated with the previous word."" 

Rule: When the word 'walm' appears, it dictates that the color associated with the word immediately preceding 'walm' should be repeated three times. For example, in ""lug walm dax"", 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', so 'walm' translates to 'blue blue blue'. In ""zup walm"", 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', so 'walm' translates to 'yellow yellow yellow'.",1.0,108,walm
"Rule: walm -> ""repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before walm for as many times as the number of letters in the word immediately before walm.""

Looking at the examples:

1. In ""lug walm dax,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""lug"" has three letters. Therefore, ""walm"" means repeating ""blue"" three times, followed by ""green"" for ""dax.""
   Output: blue blue blue green

2. In ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""zup"" has three letters. Therefore, ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times.
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

3. In ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""wif"" has three letters. Therefore, the first ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times, and since the word before the second ""walm"" is ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"" and has three letters, it also repeats ""blue"" three times.
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

4. In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""zup"" has three letters. Thus, ""walm"" means repeating ""yellow"" three times.
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

5. In ""lug dax zup dax walm wif,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""dax"" has three letters. Therefore, ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times.
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red

Based on these observations, the rule appears to operate consistently across all provided examples. 

Walm -> ""repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before walm for as many times as the number of letters in that word.""",1.0,108,walm
"walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: 

Examining the given input-output pairs, we observe that ""walm"" corresponds to a group of three colors in the output. Specifically, ""walm"" generates three instances of the color that immediately follows the word ""dax"" in the sequence. To determine the rule, we can list the occurrences:

1. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green (walm = blue blue blue)
2. lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue (walm = yellow yellow yellow)
3. wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> red red red green yellow red blue blue blue (walm = red red red)
4. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow (walm = yellow yellow yellow)
5. lug dax zup dax walm wif -> blue green yellow green green green red (walm = green green green)

From this, we infer that ""walm"" results in a sequence of three colors that immediately follow ""dax"" when ""dax"" precedes ""walm"". If ""dax"" does not precede ""walm"", then ""walm"" replicates the color of the word that precedes ""walm"".

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: ""walm"" is replaced by three consecutive instances of the color associated with the word immediately following ""dax"" if it is present before ""walm"" in the sequence. If ""dax"" does not precede ""walm"", then ""walm"" is replaced by three instances of the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""walm"".",1.0,108,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a color that is determined by the preceding word. If we analyze the patterns:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" and the output for ""walm"" is also ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow.""
- In the last example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is ""green."" 

However, in the third example, it seems there is a discrepancy, because the previous rule that ""lug"" leads to ""blue"" isn't consistent here. In this example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which normally corresponds to ""red,"" but the output is ""blue,"" the same as ""lug."" Perhaps ""walm"" takes on the last color in the sequence that is not ""red.""

Using this information, we can theorize that ""walm"" translates to the color of the previous word except when the previous word is ""wif,"" in which case it might default to another color, possibly from earlier in the sequence. Given the data, that color seems to be ""blue"" from ""lug.""

Since we have ambiguous evidence, we need to propose a rule that works across all examples or recognize the inconsistency might reflect an incomplete understanding:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it translates to ""blue.""
2. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" it translates to ""yellow.""
3. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" it translates to ""green.""
4. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output becomes inconsistent, so we may need additional context or examples.

So, the tentative rule for ""walm,"" with an exception noted for the combination with ""wif,"" would be:

Rule: ""walm"" translates to the color corresponding to the word that precedes it, with a possible exception or different rule when it follows ""wif.""",0.8,108,walm
"Reviewing the examples provided, let's examine the word ""walm"" within each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: lug walm dax | Output: blue blue blue green
2. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug | Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
3. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm | Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
4. Input: zup walm | Output: yellow yellow yellow
5. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif | Output: blue green yellow green green green red

Now, let's deduce the rule based on the position of ""walm"" and the color that follows it in the output:

1. ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and is followed by ""dax"" -> output is ""blue blue blue green""
   Indicates ""walm"" translates to a triple repeat of the color before it (blue) and then green.

2. ""walm"" follows ""zup"" -> output is ""yellow yellow yellow""
   Indicates ""walm"" translates to a triple repeat of the color before it (yellow).

3. ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and is followed by ""dax"" -> output is ""red red red green""
   Consistent with example 1, where ""walm"" is also followed by ""dax"" and the last color in the output is green.

4. In example 5, ""walm"" follows two instances of ""dax"" and precedes ""wif"" -> output is ""green green green red""
   This again seems to indicate that ""walm"" results in a triple repeat of the last color before it, which is green in this case, followed by red.

So we can deduce the following rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning. The word ""walm"" causes the preceding color's name to be repeated three times, and if ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" a 'green' is appended after the triple repeat.

Note: There is an ambiguity in the rule where ""dax"" ends a sequence (like in example 1) it might specifically trigger the color 'green' to follow a ""walm."" If ""walm"" is not followed by ""dax,"" we don't have enough examples to determine if another color follows the triple repeat, but we can infer that at least the triple repeat aspect is consistent.",0.8,108,walm

- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" translates to ""green"" (as seen in the second example, it's repeated three times after ""dax"", which means it could potentially mean ""green"" or just repetition of the previous color)
- ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" (from the fourth example, it's placed after ""dax"", and it outputs green)

- ""zup lug walm"" outputs ""yellow blue blue blue"", so ""walm"" again repeats the word ""lug"" (blue) three times, and ""zup"" translates to yellow separately.
- ""wif walm zup walm"" becomes ""red red red yellow yellow yellow""; hence, ""walm"" repeats ""wif"" (red) three times and afterward repeats ""zup"" (yellow) three times.
- ""dax walm zup lug walm"" outputs ""green green green yellow blue blue blue"", where ""walm"" first repeats ""dax"" (green) three times, then ""zup"" (yellow) once followed by ""lug walm"" (blue) repeated three times.

- ""dax walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue blue blue"" because ""dax"" means green, ""zup"" means yellow, and ""lug"" means blue.

Output: ""blue blue blue""

2. ""zup lug walm"" -> ""lug"" again precedes ""walm,"" and since ""lug"" has now appeared twice, ""walm"" means repeat ""blue"" twice.
Output: ""yellow blue blue blue""

3. ""wif walm zup walm"" -> ""wif"" precedes the first ""walm,"" leading to a repetition of ""red"" three times (since ""wif"" has appeared once, ""walm"" repeats the associated color three times).

Rule: ""wif"" gives ""red,"" followed by ""walm,"" which triples it this time as ""red red red,"" ""zup"" gives one ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" triples it again as ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Input: dax walm zup lug walm
Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
Rule: ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and ""walm"" seems to triple it to ""green green green,"" ""zup"" gives ""yellow,"" ""lug"" gives ""blue,"" and ""walm"" doubles the last set of colors ""blue blue blue.""

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
Rule: This is consistent with the first example, where ""lug"" gives ""blue,"" and ""walm"" doubles it.

Based on these examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" has a context-dependent effect related to repeating the previously mentioned color. It triples if it's the first instance after a color and doubles if it's the second or later instance.

From the examples:

2. Input: wif zup

Here, ""wif"" is followed by ""zup,"" and the output is ""red yellow."" It indicates that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

3. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif

We see that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" as before corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" also corresponds to ""green,"" followed by ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red.""

4. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   
""bluf"" is a new word and corresponds to ""red."" Since we have established ""wif"" also corresponds to ""red,"" we now have two instances of ""red red.""

5. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue

This confirms that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" seems to be consistently associated with ""green."" However, in this example, ""walm"" is resulting in ""blue blue,"" which might indicate that ""walm"" affects the following word(s), doubling them. It's notable that in example 3, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" with the output ""green green red,"" which doesn't follow the pattern from example 5 where ""walm"" is duplicated. Therefore, the effect of ""walm"" on the word following it seems inconsistent or context-dependent.

From these examples, it can be inferred that:

- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red.""
- The other words each correspond to their own respective colors.
- ""walm"" has some contextual effect that causes duplication, but not consistently across these examples.

- When ""wif"" appears with other nonce words, it appends ""red"" to the output sequence where each nonce word corresponds to a unique color.

From the last two examples, we can also deduce that ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""red"" like ""wif,"" and ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue."" It is consistent with ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" likely corresponds to a repeated ""blue."" 

The rule seems to be:

Rule: Based on the given examples where ""bluf"" occurs, the output consistently corresponds to ""red."" Therefore, the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red.""",1.0,110,bluf
"Reviewing the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" consistently generates the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Based on this, we can deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" within this context:

bluf -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.",1.0,110,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. Here's the color mapping as per the given examples:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- walm -> yellow
- dax -> green
- wif -> red

Now let's determine what ""bluf"" corresponds to by examining the examples:

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

If we match each input word to its color output, we see that every word corresponds to a single color except for ""bluf,"" which seems to correspond to two colors, ""red red"" in this case. This is because ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red) in the input.

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red blue red

In this example, ""bluf"" appears twice. The first ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red) and precedes ""dax"" (green), corresponding to ""red green"" in the output. The second ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""wif,"" corresponding again to both colors ""green red."" Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color of the word before it as well as the one after it.

Let's see if this rule holds for the remaining examples.

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green

Here, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" (green) and there's no word after ""bluf"" to provide a following color, so ""bluf"" simply repeats the color ""green green,"" matching the preceding color twice. The rule seems to hold.

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green

In this case, ""bluf"" again repeats the colors of the words before and after it: ""red"" from ""wif"" and ""green"" from ""dax"". So, ""bluf"" again corresponds to ""red green.""

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

Here, there is no word after ""bluf,"" so it repeats the color of ""zup"" (yellow) twice, as per the observed rule.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the word before it followed by the color of the word after it. If there's no word after it, then the color before it is repeated.",1.0,110,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at each instance of the word and its corresponding output:

1. Input: ""wif bluf dax"" 
   Output: ""red red green""
   
2. Input: ""dax bluf"" 
   Output: ""green green""
   
3. Input: ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" 
   Output: ""red red green green red red blue red""
   
4. Input: ""zup bluf"" 
   Output: ""yellow yellow""
   
5. Input: ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" 
   Output: ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""

From examples 1 and 2, whenever ""bluf"" follows a color word (wif or dax), it always translates to the same color (red or green). However, in example 5, ""bluf"" does not repeat the preceding color (wif -> red), but instead, it is followed by ""red red,"" suggesting a change in pattern.

Checking examples 3 and 4, we again see ""bluf"" repeat the preceding color word (red and yellow).

Considering the examples provided, the most consistent interpretation is that ""bluf"" duplicates the color word immediately prior to ""bluf."" However, in example 5, this pattern doesn't hold for the second occurrence of ""bluf,"" which could be an exception or indicate that there is an additional rule we do not have enough information about.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the preceding color word.

Given this understanding, there might be a special case or error in example 5 that contradicts this rule, so I would conclude:

bluf -> duplicates the color of the preceding color word, with a possible exception or additional rule not fully discernible from the examples provided.",0.8,110,bluf

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color red, regardless of its position within the input sequence.",0.6,110,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, each instance of the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a sequential repetition of the color that follows it. For instance, ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, and when ""walm"" is used before ""lug,"" the output is multiple instances of the color ""blue."" Observing the different examples, ""walm"" consistently results in repeating the ensuing color:

- In example 1, ""walm lug"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" causes the preceding color ""yellow"" to be repeated three times, followed by ""lug"" which is ""blue.""
- In example 2, ""zup walm dax wif bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow green red red,"" where ""walm"" precedes ""dax,"" leading to a repetition of the color ""yellow"" before ""dax,"" which is ""green.""
- In example 3, ""wif walm lug bluf"" results in ""red red red blue blue,"" meaning ""walm"" caused ""red"" to repeat thrice before ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" followed by ""bluf,"" which is ""red red.""
- In example 4, ""dax wif walm"" results in ""green red red red,"" where ""walm"" again causes ""red"" to repeat thrice after ""wif,"" which is ""red.""
- In example 5, ""wif dax lug walm"" results in ""red green blue blue blue,"" with ""walm"" making ""blue"" (corresponding to ""lug"") repeat three times after it.

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" represents a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. To confirm this, let's look at the inputs and outputs:

Input: zup walm lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and ""walm"" subsequently produces another yellow before moving onto ""lug"" which is blue.

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
- Once again, after ""zup"" which is yellow, ""walm"" follows and another yellow is produced, even after another occurrence of ""zup"".

Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue
- Here ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" causes a repetition of red before moving on to ""lug"" and ""bluf"".

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red
- ""dax"" is green, ""wif"" is red and then ""walm"" follows, indicating another red.

Input: wif dax lug walm
Output: red green blue blue blue
- The sequence ends with ""lug"" which is blue and ""walm"" which causes the color blue to be repeated.

Rule:
walm -> meaning: Repeat the color that corresponds to the immediately preceding word.

Based on the rule induction from the provided examples, the rule for ""walm"" is to repeat the color produced by the preceding word in the list.",1.0,110,walm
"Based on the examples provided:

- When a single instance of ""walm"" appears, it leads to two occurrences of the color represented by the word just before it in the output.
- When ""walm"" appears after the sequence ""zup lug zup"", it outputs ""yellow yellow"", which is consistent with the rule above, as ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- The example ""wif walm lug bluf"" seems to keep the pattern as ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and we see ""red red"" in the output, followed by a single ""blue"" for ""lug.""
- In the example ""dax wif walm,"" we can see ""red red red"" after ""wif,"" indicating ""walm"" caused a duplication of ""red.""
- Finally, the example ""wif dax lug walm"" shows the same pattern where ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" resulting in ""blue blue blue.""

Given these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> duplicates the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it in the output.",1.0,110,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the inputs and their respective outputs, focusing on the positions where ""walm"" occurs and the corresponding output color.

Input: zup walm lug / Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
- Here, ""walm"" corresponds to the third ""yellow"" in the output, following two instances of ""zup,"" which also correspond to ""yellow.""

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf / Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
- In this sequence, ""walm"" follows a ""zup"" and precedes ""dax."" ""Walm"" corresponds with ""yellow"" once again.

Input: wif walm lug bluf / Output: red red red blue blue
- ""Walm"" is between two instances of ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" Again, ""walm"" leads to an output of ""red.""

Input: dax wif walm / Output: green red red red
- ""Walm"" is at the end, preceded by ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" ""Walm"" causes ""red"" to be the output.

Input: wif dax lug walm / Output: red green blue blue blue
- Here, ""walm"" is at the end, following ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue."" ""Walm"" leads to ""blue"" as the output.

From these observations, it appears that ""walm"" takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it. If there is no word prior to ""walm,"" we cannot deduce the rule because no such example was given.

Rule: walm -> takes on the color of the preceding word.",1.0,110,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns in the given examples to understand its representation in the output. We need to compare the inputs and outputs to see how ""walm"" affects the colors that are output.

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" The word ""lug"" is common across examples and appears to map to ""blue,"" so ""walm"" likely impacts the preceding word, possibly converting it to multiple instances of its corresponding color.

- The second example further supports this, as ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow,"" as it did in the first example, and the subsequent ""dax wif bluf"" adds ""yellow green red red"" to the output, consistent with the color mappings observed for these words in other examples. 

- The third and fourth examples directly start with ""wif walm"" or a variant thereof, producing ""red red red"" before continuing with the expected pattern for ""lug"" and ""bluf"" or just stopping with ""red"".

- The final example includes ""lug walm"" at the end, which results in ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" may cause the preceding word to be output three times instead of once.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" follows another word, the color that corresponds to that word is output three times instead of once.

- ""zup lug zup dax"" corresponds to ""yellow blue yellow green""
- ""lug dax"" corresponds to ""blue green""

Here, we can observe that the word ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input string. Additionally, other words in the input such as ""lug"" and ""zup"" are consistently mapped to the colors ""blue"" and ""yellow"", respectively.

The rule I induce for the word 'dax' is:

2. In ""dax walm wif walm"", the sequence ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green"", and the ""wif"" that follows outputs ""red"", which is different from the last color before it, and the following ""walm"" continues with ""red red red"" which is a sequence of three reds, mimicking the sequence of three greens that ""dax walm"" had produced.
3. In ""zup lug wif"", ""zup lug"" outputs ""yellow blue"", and ""wif"" outputs ""red"", which again is different from ""blue"", the last color before it.
4. In ""wif zup"", ""wif"" outputs ""red"", and ""zup"" follows with ""yellow"".
5. In ""wif dax wif lug wif"", the second ""wif"" after ""dax"" changes the output color to ""blue"", which was not outputted by ""dax"", and the final ""wif"" changes the output color to ""red"" again.

The rule seems to be that ""wif"" results in changing to a color that was not produced by the word immediately preceding it, with a preference for red when it leads the sequence, or when it follows a word associated with green. 

Upon closer observation, however, it seems like ""wif"" outputs ""red"" each time it is encountered, with only one instance of it being followed by ""blue"" which seems to be an exception responding to the word ""lug"".

- When ""bluf"" comes after ""dax zup,"" the pattern in the output is ""green yellow yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" comes after ""wif lug,"" the pattern in the output is ""red blue blue.""

It seems that ""bluf"" takes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it and repeats it. In simpler terms, ""bluf"" doubles the output color of the word before it.

Therefore, the rule is:

bluf -> Repeat the output color of the preceding word.",0.8,111,bluf
"Based on the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, we can attempt to induce a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" in this specific context.

In the first example:
- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"".

In the second example:
- ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" translates to ""red green yellow red green green"",
  which means that the word ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" when following ""dax"".

In the third example:
- ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow"",
  reinforcing the idea that ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" when following ""zup"".

In the fourth example:
- ""wif lug bluf"" translates to ""red blue blue"",
  which suggests that ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" when following ""lug"".

Looking at the pattern, it seems that the meaning of ""bluf"" changes based on the word that immediately precedes it. Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes it. If no color word precedes it, ""bluf"" defaults to the color mentioned before it, or to ""red"" if it is the first word.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word. If the preceding word is not a color word, ""bluf"" defaults to the color mentioned before it, or to ""red"" if at the start.",0.8,111,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. The relationship between the input and output is as follows:

- ""dax lug walm"" outputs ""green blue blue blue,"" which means ""walm"" repeated the color associated with ""lug"" (blue) three times.
- ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" outputs ""green blue blue blue green red red green,"" which means ""walm"" again repeated the color associated with ""lug"" (blue) three times, ""dax"" is green, ""wif"" is red, and ""bluf"" doesn't seem to conform to a specific rule likely due to a typing error (assuming ""bluf"" should be ""wif"", it would follow the pattern with red being repeated).
- ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red,"" following the rule, ""walm"" repeats the red color of ""wif"" three times.
- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow,"" following the rule, ""walm"" repeats the yellow color of ""zup"" three times.
- ""dax walm zup walm"" outputs ""green green green yellow yellow yellow,"" conforming to the rule as ""walm"" repeats the green color of ""dax"" and the yellow color of ""zup"" three times each.

- In ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"", ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" leading to ""blue blue blue"", and ""dax"" precedes the next ""walm"" which would have led to ""green green green"" if there was another instance of ""walm"" following ""dax"".
- In ""wif walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to red, so ""walm"" leads to ""red red red"".
- In ""zup walm"", ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, so ""walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In ""dax walm zup walm"", first ""dax"" leads to ""green green green"" and then ""zup"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"".

"walm -> repetition of the previous color

Rule: The word ""walm"" signifies that the color word preceding it should be repeated three times.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" the best approach is to look for patterns related to the word in different contexts within the given examples:

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Here, ""walm"" seems to result in the word ""blue"" being repeated three times.

Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

Again, ""walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated three times. The other words correspond to their respective colors one-to-one except for ""bluf,"" which isn't translated, possibly a typo or not recognized.

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Here, ""walm"" is associated with ""red"" being repeated thrice. 

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

In this context, ""walm"" leads to ""yellow"" being output three times.

Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

Each occurrence of ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to be output three times.

Based on these observations, the general rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times.

1. Each instance of ""dax"" is followed by a specific color, regardless of its position in the sequence:

    - Input: lug dax // Output: blue green

In each of these cases, ""dax"" corresponds directly to ""green"" in the output.

2. The word ""dax"" appears to be independent of its surrounding context since the word ""dax"" always results in ""green"" regardless of the words that precede or follow it.

Therefore, we can induce the following rule based on the given examples:

    - 'lug' correlates with the color 'blue'
    - 'walm' correlates with the color 'blue'

3. The rule for 'wif' seems consistent regardless of the other words around it; it always results in the color 'red'. There is no evident change in output based on context or other words present.

Thus, bluf -> red.",1.0,112,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the correlation between the inputs and outputs in each example.

2. In the third example, ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" corresponds to ""blue blue red blue red red red blue,"" where ""bluf"" matches with the second ""red.""
3. Similarly, in the last example, the sequence ""wif bluf dax"" within the larger input string corresponds to ""green red red green,"" showing that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" again.

Rule: bluf -> red",1.0,112,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red."" 

Evidence: In every example, regardless of the words surrounding ""bluf,"" the output associated with ""bluf"" is consistently ""red.""

bluf -> red",1.0,112,bluf
"From the examples provided, we can deduce the following pattern for the word 'bluf':

- In every output where 'bluf' is present in the input, the word that directly follows 'bluf' has an output with the same color as 'bluf'.

Let's validate this rule with the given examples:

1. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
    - 'bluf' and the word immediately after 'bluf' ('dax') both output 'yellow'.

2. wif bluf -> red red
    - 'bluf' and the word immediately before 'bluf' ('wif') both output 'red'. (Noticed the pattern is the same but the word 'wif' is before 'bluf' here. This could mean 'bluf' takes the color of the adjacent word regardless of position.)

3. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> blue blue red blue red red red blue
    - 'bluf' and the word immediately after 'bluf' ('wif') both output 'blue'. 

4. wif bluf -> red red
    - 'bluf' and 'wif' output 'red' similar to example 2; consistent with the pattern.

5. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green
    - 'bluf' and the word immediately after 'bluf' ('dax') both output 'red', however, this is inconsistent with what we saw in example 1 where 'dax' output 'green'. This suggests the rule might be slightly more complex than initially thought. It concerns the nearby words but might also depend on the position or a sequence of words.

With this information, the rule seems to be that 'bluf' outputs the same color as an adjacent word, but the exact pattern is inconsistent when considering the 'dax' outputs. Since 'dax' outputs 'green' when it comes before 'bluf', but 'red' when it comes after 'bluf', this raises questions about our initial rule.

A possible rule considering the inconsistency might be that 'bluf' changes the color output of the following word to match its own, but when 'dax' comes after 'bluf', 'dax' has a fixed output of 'red' regardless of 'bluf's' color.

Therefore, the rule for 'bluf' appears to be that it takes on the output color of an adjacent word but also may influence the color output of the following word, with an exception noted for 'dax' when it follows 'bluf'.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color output of the adjacent word and may influence the following word's output color, with exceptions.",0.7,112,bluf
"Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word

Based on the examples provided, the appearance of the nonce word ""walm"" results in the output being multiple repetitions of the color associated with the word directly preceding ""walm"". Each word corresponds to a specific color: ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""dax"" corresponds to green. When ""walm"" appears, it takes the color of the word before it and repeats it a number of times.

To illustrate:

- In the first example, ""zup walm wif"", ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, so ""walm"" outputs ""yellow"" three times before the pattern changes with the introduction of ""wif"" which is red.
- In the second example, ""dax lug dax lug walm"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue. Thus, ""walm"" outputs ""blue"" four times as it repeats the color of ""lug"".
- In the third example, ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"", ""wif"" corresponds to red. ""Walm"" outputs red three times after ""wif,"" before the pattern changes back to blue with ""lug"".
- In the fourth example, ""dax walm lug"", ""dax"" corresponds to green. Thus, ""walm"" outputs ""green"" three times, followed by ""lug"" which is blue.
- In the fifth example, ""lug zup dax walm"", ""dax"" corresponds to green. Thus, ""walm"" outputs ""green"" three times following ""dax.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" results in the color of the preceding word being repeated multiple times (three times in each provided example). The number of repetitions might be fixed at three, as that is the only frequency observed, but if more examples showed a different number of repetitions this rule might need to be revised. For now, it appears consistent across the provided examples.",1.0,112,walm
"Analyzing the given input and output sequences, let’s focus on the patterns associated with 'walm':

1. ""zup walm wif"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow red"".
2. ""dax lug dax lug walm"" leads to ""green blue green blue blue blue"".
3. ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" leads to ""blue blue red blue red red red blue"".
4. ""dax walm lug"" leads to ""green green green blue"".
5. ""lug zup dax walm"" leads to ""blue yellow green green green"".

The term 'walm' always appears at the end of an input sequence before the output sequence ends. To deduce the rule behind 'walm', let’s examine the position and translation of words right before 'walm' appears:

1. In example 1, 'wif' comes before 'walm', and in the output, the colors repeat 'yellow' (from 'zup') thrice before ending with 'red'. 'wif' is translated as 'red' in the other examples.

2. In example 2, 'lug' comes before 'walm', and the pattern for 'lug' is 'blue'. 'dax' translates to 'green'. In the output, the 'green blue' pattern is repeated followed by 'blue blue', indicating a doubling of 'blue'.

3. In example 3, 'wif' precedes 'walm' again, and 'lug' follows 'walm'. It seems that for each 'wif', there’s a 'red' after 'walm' in the output, plus an additional 'blue' from the following 'lug'.

4. In example 4, 'dax' is before 'walm', translating to 'green'. In the output, 'green' is repeated thrice, followed by a 'blue' from 'lug' after 'walm'.

5. In example 5, 'dax' precedes 'walm', again translating to 'green'. The output shows a repetition of 'green' three times.

From these patterns, we can deduce that 'walm' likely indicates a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. It seems to be a multiplier for the color or word that comes before it, and then follows the translation of the word right after 'walm'. Here's the generalized rule:

Rule: 'walm' -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately before 'walm' a certain number of times and continue with the translation of words after it, if any.

For these examples, 'walm' appears to repeat the preceding color three times before continuing with the rest of the sequence. However, the number of repetitions depends on the color before 'walm': for the 'green' and 'yellow' colors, it does three repetitions, and for 'blue', it does a double repetition after the first blue. The rule for translating 'walm' is consistently a color repetition with a variation for blue.",0.8,112,walm
"To determine the meaning or the rule of ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs provided in the examples.

Looking at the first input and output:

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red

The only new word here relative to its color is ""walm,"" and since the colors for ""zup"" and ""wif"" are known to be yellow and red, respectively, it seems that ""walm"" did not introduce a new color but repeated the color of the word before it (""zup"" -> yellow). However, ""walm"" did not repeat the color of ""wif"" afterward.

The second input and output introduces ""walm"" after a sequence of two colors:

Input: dax lug dax lug walm
Output: green blue green blue blue blue

Again, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word before it, which in this case is ""lug"" corresponding to blue, and it repeats it twice.

The third input and output feature ""walm"" surrounded by words whose colors are already known:

Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

Here, ""walm"" follows a sequence of reds (associated with ""wif""), and before the ""walm"" sequence begins, there is a ""wif."" The output is a triple repetition of red, which suggests that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it multiple times, in this case, three times because ""wif"" is followed by three ""red.""

The fourth and fifth examples also support this pattern:

Input: dax walm lug
Output: green green green blue

Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green

In both cases, ""walm"" follows a word and the output repeats the color of the word before it, two times for the fourth example and three times for the fifth example. The key then seems to be that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color of the previous word.

Rule: walm -> walm causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated multiple times in the output, with the specific number of repetitions possibly related to which word comes before ""walm.""",0.8,112,walm
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to relate to a sequence of colours that are determined by the immediately preceding word. Let's examine the patterns:

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red
Rule: ""walm"" follows ""zup"" with three repeats of the colour associated with ""zup"" (yellow), followed by the colour associated with ""wif"" (red).

Input: dax lug dax lug walm
Output: green blue green blue blue blue
Rule: ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" with a repetition of the colour associated with ""lug"" (blue) by the number of times ""lug"" has appeared before ""walm"" (two instances of ""lug"" before ""walm"" results in two additional blues after the usual single blue).

Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
Rule: ""walm"" occurs after ""wif"" with a repetition of the colour associated with ""wif"" (red) based on its preceding frequency (two instances of ""wif"" before ""walm"" results in two additional reds after the usual single red).

Input: dax walm lug
Output: green green green blue
Rule: ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" resulting in three repeats of the colour associated with ""dax"" (green) before continuing with the next colour sequence.

Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green
Rule: ""walm"" occurs after ""dax,"" leading to three repeats of the colour associated with ""dax"" (green).

After examining all examples, the pattern for ""walm"" can be inferred as follows:
- ""walm"" repeats the colour of the word preceding it, but the number of repetitions depends on the specific word. 
- For ""zup"" preceding ""walm,"" the colour (yellow) is repeated three times.
- For ""dax"" preceding ""walm,"" the colour (green) is also repeated three times.
- For ""lug"" preceding ""walm,"" the colour (blue) is repeated two times plus one time for each ""lug"" present before ""walm"" in the sequence.
- For ""wif"" the available data is not sufficient to confirm a clear pattern of repetition as it is followed by ""walm"" only once, so it replicates its related colour (red) only once plus the standard repetition, thus in total twice.

Given the lack of further context, the most consistent rule that can be deduced is that ""walm"" extends the sequence with additional instances of the colour associated with the preceding word, with the specific repetition rules varying by the preceding word, as evidenced by ""zup"" and ""dax"" both resulting in three repetitions of their associated colours, while ""lug"" depends on the frequency of its occurrence.

walm -> meaning: A repetition of the colour associated with the preceding word, with the number of repetitions potentially varying based on the specific preceding word.",0.8,112,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer patterns related to the word ""walm"" and the corresponding output colors. Here is the analysis:

- In every instance where ""walm"" appears, it is followed by multiple outputs of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm"". Specifically, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the preceding word either two or three times. We can also notice that when it is the last word, it causes the previous color to repeat until the end of the output.

- Example 1: ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and outputs as red. ""Walm"" results in three reds. 
- Example 2: ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and outputs as blue. ""Walm"" results in two additional blues.
- Example 3: ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and outputs as red. ""Walm"" causes the output to have two additional reds.
- Example 4: ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and outputs as green. ""Walm"" results in two additional greens.
- Example 5: ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and outputs as green. ""Walm"" results in three additional greens.

Rule: ""Walm"" -> ""Repeat the color of the preceding word two or three additional times.""

It is important to note that to fully confirm this rule, we would expect to see a consistent number of repetitions after ""walm"" (either always two or always three). However, in the given examples, the repetitions differ between two and three. It's possible that this could be influenced by additional context not provided in the examples, but with the limited information available, this seems to be the closest rule that can be deduced. 

For example, in example 5, ""walm"" results in three additional greens, which is the last output sequence, suggesting that ""walm"" repeated the preceding color until the end of the output sequence. Meanwhile, in example 3, it did not continue to the end, as the output sequence continued with another color afterwards.

So with this in mind, the rule might be refined to:

Rule: ""Walm"" -> ""Repeat the color of the preceding word until the end of the sequence or for two additional times if the sequence continues with another word.""",0.8,112,walm

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output includes the color ""green.""
2. It also appears that ""dax"" generates an additional ""green"" in the output following its own appearance.

From these observations, we can infer that ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green"" in the output, and it also influences the following word to also be associated with the color ""green.""

Based on this pattern, here is the rule:

dax -> ""dax"" translates to the color green and causes the next word (if any) to also be translated to the color green.

Rule: When ""dax"" is encountered, output ""green"" and change the following word's output to ""green"" regardless of that word's usual color assignment.",1.0,113,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green"". Each time the word ""dax"" is present in an input, the color ""green"" is outputted.

Here's the correlation between the word ""dax"" and the color ""green"":

1. Every time ""dax"" appears, the output includes ""green"" for that position.
2. When ""dax"" is followed by another word, such as ""walm"" or ""wif"", it continues to translate to ""green"".
3. ""dax"" alone also translates to ""green"".
4. Other words such as ""wif"" or ""bluf"" seem to have their own color association regardless of the presence of ""dax"", with ""wif"" associated with ""red"" and ""bluf"" with ""green"" in the context of the first example and ""bluf"" possibly associated with ""red"" in the third example (or the rule might be more complex).

Given these observations, the rule seems consistent:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,113,dax
"dax -> meaning. The word ""dax"" seems to indicate the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence. 

Rule: ""dax"" translates to ""green.""",1.0,113,dax

Based on the examples provided, whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the output color is green, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

The only consistent rule is that ""dax"" leads to the output ""green.""",1.0,113,dax

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,113,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,113,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" each time it is used. 

So the rule is: wif -> red.",1.0,113,wif

wif -> red",1.0,113,wif
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' consistently translates to the color 'yellow', regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.",1.0,113,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can determine that ""zup"" correlates to the color ""yellow."" However, to solidify this rule, we should examine how ""zup"" affects the sequence of colors in different contexts.

- In the first example, ""zup"" appears at the beginning and end, with the word ""bluf"" in the middle. The output starts and ends with ""yellow,"" and ""blue"" appears in the middle, which corresponds to ""bluf.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" appears at the beginning and ""lug"" appears at the end. The output series starts with three ""yellow"" and ends with ""green blue,"" which matches ""dax lug."" ""Dax"" is associated with ""green"" from another example.
- In the third example, ""zup"" appears in the sequence after two instances of ""dax,"" which is associated with ""green."" The output starts with ""green red green"" with ""wif"" correlating to ""red."" Following this pattern, the two ""yellow"" at the end correspond to ""zup bluf.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm zup"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow,"" meaning ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" does not seem to directly translate to a color but instead may mean ""repeat the previous color,"" and ""zup"" at the end results in ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" again repeats the previous color (""yellow"").

Considering the consistent appearance of ""yellow"" whenever ""zup"" is mentioned, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""zup"" -> ""yellow""",1.0,113,zup
"From the examples provided, we can infer that ""zup"" is represented by the color ""yellow."" This inference is based on the consistent output of ""yellow"" every time ""zup"" appears in the input.

Rule: Bluf takes the color mentioned just before it and repeats it one more time.",1.0,113,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" seems to be ""repeating the color word that directly precedes it"".

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" follows a color word, it indicates that the color word should be duplicated. For instance, ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue"", ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"", and ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"".",1.0,113,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to represent a rule where the color ""red"" is repeated. It is probably a command that turns the following word's color into red until a new color command is encountered.

For instance, in the first example, the pattern ""zup dax walm zup wif"" translates to ""yellow green green green yellow red"". Here, the word ""walm"" falls between ""dax"" (green) and ""zup"" (yellow), but instead of turning ""zup"" into its corresponding color yellow, ""walm"" causes the next word to turn red, which then continues until a new color word is introduced.

In every example, after the word ""walm"", the color red is repeated until a different color word appears (""dax"" for green, ""zup"" for yellow, etc). This suggests that ""walm"" does not have a one-to-one correspondence with a particular color, but rather sets a rule for the words that follow.

Rule: walm -> Causes the following words to output the color ""red"" until a new color command is encountered.",1.0,113,walm
"walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: The word ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color that corresponds to the word just before it. In the given examples, ""walm"" causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated an additional three times. For instance, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green green,"" with ""green"" corresponding to ""dax"" and being repeated three extra times due to the presence of ""walm.""",1.0,113,walm
"Using the examples provided, we can deduce the following patterns and correlations between the inputs and outputs:

Each instance of ""walm"" in the input corresponds to multiple occurrences of ""red"" in the output. More specifically, ""walm"" seems to correspond to three ""red"" in sequence. Occurrences of other words (""zup,"" ""dax,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""bluf"") correspond to single instances of their respective color in the output. 

Observing the instances:

- In ""zup dax walm zup wif,"" ""walm"" is followed by three ""red"" in the output.
- In ""dax wif walm,"" ""walm"" is again followed by three ""red.""
- In ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax,"" ""walm"" once more is followed by three ""red,"" confirming the pattern.
- In ""wif walm dax,"" ""walm"" is in between ""wif"" and ""dax,"" and as before, it's followed by three ""red.""
- Finally, in ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm,"" we see again that ""walm"" is followed by three ""red"" both times it appears.

Rule:
walm -> three consecutive instances of the color red in the sequence.",1.0,113,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" is associated with the output of a sequence of red colors, and the number of red colors in the sequence is dependent on the context. To determine the specific rule, let's analyze the given examples and the corresponding outputs:

- In the first example, the word ""walm"" results in three green color outputs following it.
- In the second example, the word ""walm"" yields three red color outputs following it.
- In the third example, the word ""walm"" leads to two blue color outputs following it.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" results in three red color outputs following it.
- And in the fifth example, ""walm"" leads to three blue colors outputs following it.

This suggests that ""walm"" changes the color output to the color of the following word and replicates it three times.

Rule: walm -> When ""walm"" is followed by a color word, the output is three occurrences of the next word's corresponding color.",0.8,113,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns before and after its appearance within the examples and see how they correlate with the output colors:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" is surrounded by ""zup"" and ""zup"" again. Since ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""walm"" produces three greens in a row, ""walm"" doesn't seem to be simply taking on the color of the word immediately before or after.

2. In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (which corresponds to red) and is followed by nothing. It outputs three reds, so it might suggest that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word preceding it, since ""wif"" is red, but this is not confirmed because in the first example ""walm"" did not repeat the yellow of ""zup.""

3. In the third example, ""walm"" is after ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, and followed by ""dax."" In this case, ""walm"" produces three blues. Based on this and the second example, it might seem that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it, but we need to look further because of the inconsistency with the first example.

4. In the fourth example, ""wif"" (red) is followed by ""walm"" and then ""dax"" (green), and ""walm"" is again three reds, which leans towards ""walm"" repeating the preceding word's color.

5. In the fifth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" then ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""walm"" again. The ""walm"" here produces two sequences of three reds and three blues, respectively, each time following ""wif"" (red) and ""lug"" (blue).

After checking all examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems clear despite the confusion caused by the initial entry. ""Walm"" takes the color of the word preceding it and repeats it three times. However, we must note that this conclusion might be wrong if ""zup"" does not actually correspond to yellow, since the first example creates an inconsistency. Assuming that ""zup"" is indeed yellow, ""walm"" seems to be an anomaly in the first example. Ignoring this potential inconsistency, the rule appears to be:

Rule: walm -> repeats the output color of the word immediately before it three times.

Given this rule:

walm -> meaning. Walm means repeating the color of the preceding word three times.",0.8,113,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. The word 'lug' consistently corresponds to the color 'blue' in every example provided.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,114,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,114,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Here's how the rule was determined:

1. The first example indicates that ""lug"" is followed by ""dax"" and the output is ""blue green,"" which doesn't help much by itself since we cannot tell which color corresponds to ""lug"" and which to ""dax.""

2. However, the second example shows ""lug"" just before the Output ends with ""blue,"" suggesting that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

3. The third example solidifies this pattern because ""lug"" is followed by no other words, and the Output is solely ""blue.""

4. Similarly, the fourth example ends with ""lug"" followed by ""zup walm,"" and the Output sequence ends with ""blue yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""zup"" clearly corresponds to ""yellow"" based on previous examples, and ""walm"" seems to repeat this color; thus, ""lug"" can be inferred as ""blue"" here as well.

5. The last example again has ""lug"" between ""wif"" and ""zup"". Here ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", with ""lug"" outputted as ""blue"" between them.

Putting these observations together, we have:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,114,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: Each instance of the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the output.",1.0,114,lug

"Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" 

Here is the rule:

dax -> green

Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output consistently includes the word ""green."" No other context or variation is provided that alters the meaning of ""dax,"" so the simplest and most consistent rule that can be induced from these examples is that ""dax"" means ""green.""",1.0,114,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" represents the color green in all given examples.",1.0,114,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can observe the following patterns:

- Whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the output includes ""green.""
- ""Dax"" does not seem to be dependent on the position in the input, as it can appear at the beginning, middle, or end, but the output ""green"" consistently represents it.

Given these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

dax -> ""green""

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green"" in the outputs.",1.0,114,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following:

- The output ""green"" appears consistently every time the word ""dax"" is present in the input.
- ""dax"" on its own yields the output ""green"".
- When ""dax"" appears with other words (""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""zup,"" ""walm""), which each correspond to their own colors, the color ""green"" still follows immediately after the position of ""dax.""

From these observations, the rule for the meaning of ""dax"" appears to be consistent and independent of context or position among other words. Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,114,dax
"From the given examples, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Following each instance of ""wif,"" there is an output ""red."" This pattern persists regardless of the other words that follow ""wif."" Therefore, the rule appears to be:

"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. 

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" is as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,114,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" translates to a specific color. In every instance where ""zup"" is used, the output is ""yellow."" Therefore, we can deduce the meaning as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,114,zup
"Based on the given examples, ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule appears to be straightforward:

zup -> yellow

Therefore, the rule is:

"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow."" There is a one-to-one correspondence between the input ""zup"" and the output ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's analyze the examples provided and compare the inputs and the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm

   After ""dax,"" we get ""green;"" ""walm"" following ""dax"" continues the sequence of ""green."" ""wif"" leads to a ""red,"" and ""lug"" changes the output to ""blue."" Then ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" continues the sequence of ""green.""

2. Input: dax zup walm wif

   ""dax"" turns the output to ""green,"" and ""zup"" changes it to ""yellow."" ""walm"" after ""zup"" maintains the sequence of ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" changes it to ""red.""

3. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   
   Starting with ""zup"" makes it ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" keeps it ""yellow."" ""lug"" changes the output to ""blue,"" then ""zup"" back to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

4. Input: dax lug dax lug walm

   ""dax"" outputs ""green,"" ""lug"" changes it to ""blue,"" another ""dax"" again to ""green,"" and another ""lug"" to ""blue."" After the sequence of ""lug,"" ""walm"" keeps it ""blue.""

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   
   ""zup"" gives ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" maintains ""yellow.""

Rule: ""walm"" seems to maintain the color (output) of the previous word, not changing it.

So, the rule for ""walm"" is that it continues the sequence of the output color without changing it.

Rule: walm -> continues the previous color output without change.",0.9,114,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following pattern for each word:

- ""dax"" results in ""green"",
- ""zup"" results in ""yellow"",
- ""lug"" results in ""blue"",
- ""wif"" results in ""red"".

Now, to deduce the meaning of ""walm"":

1. Where ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", the output is an additional ""green"" followed by the pattern associated with the other words, except for the last example, where ""walm"" is followed only by ""blue"".

2. ""zup"" followed by ""walm"" gives three ""yellow"" outputs, regardless of what comes after ""walm"" if anything.

3. ""walm"" on its own after ""zup"" still results in three ""yellow"" outputs.

4. When ""walm"" follows ""lug"", the output is two ""blue"".

From this information, we can surmise a rule for ""walm"". It seems that ""walm"" repeats the color output of the word immediately preceding it for a certain number of times before moving to the next word's output. Specifically, if we break it down:

- After ""dax"" (which gives green), ""walm"" results in two additional ""green"".
- After ""zup"" (which gives yellow), ""walm"" results in three additional ""yellow"".
- After ""lug"" (which gives blue), ""walm"" results in two additional ""blue"".

Considering that ""dax"" and ""lug"" are consistently followed by two color repetitions when followed by ""walm"", but ""zup"" is followed by three repetitions, we might infer that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word a certain number of times based on the word that came before it: ""dax"" and ""lug"" cause two repetitions, while ""zup"" causes three.

Rule: walm -> produces a sequence of colors that repeat the color associated with the preceding word; two times if preceded by ""dax"" or ""lug,"" and three times if preceded by ""zup"".",0.9,114,walm
"Analyzing the examples where ""walm"" is included, let's try to deduce its meaning.

In the first example:
- Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
- Output: green green green red blue green green green

When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output color is green. However, it is not clear if this is a rule, as the example also includes ""wif lug,"" which precedes a ""green"" output. We will need to compare more examples.

In the second example:
- Input: dax zup walm wif
- Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

Here, after ""zup walm,"" we see a sequence of two ""yellow"" outputs. Therefore, ""walm"" does not always result in a ""green"" output following a ""dax.""

In the third example:
- Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
- Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

After ""zup walm,"" there is a ""yellow"" output. Hence, ""walm"" followed by ""zup"" seems to yield ""yellow.""

In the fourth example:
- Input: dax lug dax lug walm
- Output: green blue green blue blue blue

Here, we note that ""walm"" follows two sequences of ""dax lug,"" and the output is ""blue blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" might result in repeating the previous color, which is ""blue"" in this case.

In the final example:
- Input: zup walm
- Output: yellow yellow yellow

Following ""zup,"" ""walm"" results in ""yellow,"" which is consistent with a previous example.

Based on these observations, we can deduce a potential rule for ""walm"":

Rule: The output of ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous output.

This rule holds for all provided examples:
- Following ""dax,"" which results in ""green,"" ""walm"" repeats ""green.""
- Following ""zup,"" which results in ""yellow,"" ""walm"" repeats ""yellow.""
- And in the fourth example, it repeats the ""blue"" output which was the result of ""lug.""

Using the rule induction method, walm -> meaning would be:

Rule: walm repeats the color output of the word that comes before it.",0.8,114,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's break down the examples provided to find patterns before and after its occurrence:

Example 1:
Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
Output: green green green red blue green green green

Here, ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" and ""lug"" correlates with ""blue."" The word ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" and before ""wif,"" leading to a repeated ""green.""

Example 2:
Input: dax zup walm wif
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

In this example, ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow."" The word ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and there are extra ""yellow"" outputs.

Example 3:
Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

Here, the ""walm"" after ""zup"" leads to additional ""yellow"" outputs, similar to Example 2.

Example 4:
Input: dax lug dax lug walm
Output: green blue green blue blue blue

In this example, ""walm"" appears at the end after a series of ""dax"" and ""lug,"" producing extra ""blue"" outputs.

Example 5:
Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

In this final example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and yields extra ""yellow"" outputs.

Rule:
From these observations, it appears that ""walm"" correlates with repeating the color that was just mentioned. The number of repetitions varies, but the repeated color is related to the word that immediately precedes ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color correlated to the word immediately before it to be repeated in the output one or more times.

walm -> Rule: Causes the output color of the word immediately preceding it to repeat.",0.8,114,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided. By examining the position of ""walm"" and the corresponding output colors, we can attempt to infer its meaning or rule.

From the first example:
- ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green red blue green green green""

From the second example:
- ""dax zup walm wif"" corresponds to ""green yellow yellow yellow red""

From the third example:
- ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green""

From the fourth example:
- ""dax lug dax lug walm"" corresponds to ""green blue green blue blue blue""

From the fifth example:
- ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow""

Let's analyze the patterns surrounding the word ""walm"":

1. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", the next sequence of colors is green repeated once, disappearing ""dax"", and then repeating the sequence of colors following ""walm"". Observed in the first example with ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"".

2. When ""zup"" precedes ""walm"", the output color is simply yellow repeated three times, irrespective of what follows. This is consistent across examples two, three, and five.

3. When ""walm"" follows ""lug"", like in examples one and three, ""lug"" leads to a single ""blue,"" but the pattern after ""walm"" is not consistent with it alone; the preceding word also plays a role.
   
4. In example four, ""walm"" comes at the end, with two ""lugs"" preceding it. Each ""lug"" outputs a ""blue,"" but we do not see the word that follows ""walm"" to understand its output pattern.

Based on the evidence from these examples, it's challenging to determine a rule for ""walm"" that is entirely isolated from the other words around it. However, we can note that ""walm"" interacts with nearby words (e.g., ""dax"" or ""zup"") and alters the pattern of output colors in a way that's dependent on those words. Nonetheless, the connection between ""walm"" and the output pattern is not entirely clear.

A possible rule considering the given data might be:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word three times but replaces instances of ""dax"" with the pattern ""green green,"" no matter if ""dax"" comes before or after ""walm"".

Let's apply this tentative rule:

- It works for ""zup walm"" (yellow yellow yellow).
- It works for ""dax zup walm wif"" (green yellow yellow yellow red) if we consider that ""walm"" repeats the yellow of ""zup"" three times.
- It seems to fail for ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" because it doesn't predict the second ""blue.""

"From the given examples, it is apparent that each word corresponds to a color, and the color that is assigned to each word is repeated for every occurrence of that word. Now let's deduce the rule for 'bluf':

- In the first example, ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red."" We see that 'wif' and 'bluf' both correspond to 'red'.
- In the second example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" which supports the observation that 'bluf' corresponds to 'red'.
- In the third example, ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue green green"". 'bluf' cannot be 'green' here because 'dax' already corresponds to 'green,' and 'bluf' follows 'dax'. This suggests 'bluf' might mean a repetition of the last color mentioned before 'bluf,' which is 'green' in this case.
- In the fourth example, ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow green yellow green red red."" Here again, 'bluf' follows 'wif' and results in 'red', which was the color corresponding to 'wif'.
- In the fifth example, ""wif zup bluf"" translates to ""red yellow yellow."" The occurrence of 'bluf' results in 'yellow', which is the color corresponding to the preceding word 'zup'.

Putting these observations together, the rule for 'bluf' is that it results in the repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding 'bluf'.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,115,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the commonalities in the examples you've provided and their respective outputs.

1. ""dax wif bluf"" -> ""green red red""
2. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
3. ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" -> ""blue red blue green green""
4. ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow green yellow green red red""
5. ""wif zup bluf"" -> ""red yellow yellow""

Observing the pattern, it seems that ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color(s) related to the word(s) immediately before it. Here are the direct observations from the examples:

- In example 1, ""dax wif bluf"" outputs ""green red red,"" with ""red"" being repeated, corresponding to the word ""wif.""
- In example 2, ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red,"" with ""red"" being repeated, corresponding again to the word ""wif.""
- In example 3, ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" outputs ""blue red blue green green,"" where the colors ""green green"" are repeated, corresponding to the word ""dax"" before ""bluf.""
- In example 4, ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" outputs ""yellow green yellow green red red,"" where the colors ""red red"" are repeated, once again corresponding to the word ""wif"" before ""bluf.""
- In example 5, ""wif zup bluf"" outputs ""red yellow yellow,"" where the colors ""yellow yellow"" are repeated, corresponding to the word ""zup"" before ""bluf.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color(s) of the word(s) immediately before it.",1.0,115,bluf
"From the examples provided, we can try to deduce what ""bluf"" means by looking at the outputs and seeing what is consistent each time ""bluf"" is used in the input:

1. ""dax wif bluf"" -> ""green red red""
2. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
3. ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" -> ""blue red blue green green""
4. ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow green yellow green red red""
5. ""wif zup bluf"" -> ""red yellow yellow""

We can notice that every time the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, it repeats the color associated with the word that directly precedes it in the output:

1. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" causes it to repeat producing ""red red.""
2. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and when followed by ""bluf,"" it results in ""green green.""
3. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and when followed by ""bluf,"" it results in ""yellow yellow.""

It seems that ""bluf"" indicates a repetition of the color mapped to the word that comes before it. Hence, in each case, ""bluf"" causes the color of the preceding word to appear twice in sequence.

Rule: bluf -> causes the preceding color to repeat.",1.0,115,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can observe the following patterns:

1. When ""bluf"" appears in the sequence, the output is a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word that immediately precedes ""bluf"". This can be observed in the examples:
   - ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red"".
   - ""dax wif bluf"" ends with ""red red"" after the word ""wif"".

2. The color that follows each word that is not ""bluf"" seems to follow a consistent pattern:
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

Given these observations, ""bluf"" seems to indicate that the color immediately preceding ""bluf"" should be repeated once in the output. Therefore, ""bluf"" could be interpreted as an instruction to repeat the preceding color.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""bluf"".",0.9,115,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" I will examine the relationship between the inputs and the outputs in the given examples to identify any patterns.

Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

From these two examples, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red."" However, this alone does not confirm a rule because ""wif"" also corresponds to ""red."" We need more information from the other examples.

Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
Output: blue red blue green green

Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
Output: yellow green yellow green red red

Input: wif zup bluf
Output: red yellow yellow

Analyzing all input-output pairings, it looks like whenever ""bluf"" appears, it results in ""red"" in the output. Additionally, every single word before ""bluf"" is represented once before ""bluf"" appears, and then exactly one more time immediately after. Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to trigger the repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it.

From the examples provided:

- In the first two examples, ""red"" follows ""wif,"" and then ""bluf"" results in another ""red.""
- In the third example, ""green"" follows ""dax,"" and then ""bluf"" results in another ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""green"" follows ""dax,"" and ""bluf"" results in a repeated ""green."" However, there is an additional ""red"" at the end, which corresponds to the earlier ""wif."" This works because every word's color appears once again after the first appearance of ""bluf.""
- In the fifth example, ""yellow"" follows ""zup,"" and then ""bluf"" gives another ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> causes the next color in the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately before ""bluf.""",0.9,115,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the output color for the word ""walm"" depends on the color output of the word immediately preceding it. Specifically, ""walm"" results in three repetitions of the color that the preceding word translates to. Here's the analysis:

- In the second input, ""walm"" again follows ""lug"" with the output ""blue,"" so ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"".
- In the third input, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which outputs ""green,"" hence ""walm"" results in ""green green green"".
- In the fourth input, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and since ""dax"" outputs ""green,"" ""walm"" results in ""green green green"" again.

- In example 2, ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" following ""lug"" results in ""blue blue blue.""
- In example 3, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" following ""dax"" results in ""green green green.""

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green

Given this, when ""walm"" follows a word, the output is that word's associated color repeated three times. For example:
- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""wif lug dax walm"" produces ""red blue green green green"" because ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" followed by ""walm"" which repeats ""green"" three times (as it follows ""dax"").

Input: zup wif dax wif bluf

""zup"" is new here and corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" continues to mean ""red,"" ""dax"" again is ""green,"" and ""bluf"" is consistently ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,116,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the following pattern is observed:

- When the word ""dax"" precedes a color word, it causes the output to produce the color corresponding to that color word, as shown in ""lug dax bluf"" outputting ""blue green green"" where ""lug"" outputs ""blue"" and ""dax bluf"" outputs ""green green"".
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""wif,"" it outputs ""green red,"" where ""wif"" alone corresponds to ""red.""
- Additionally, ""dax"" followed by a non-color word like ""walm"" produces a repetition of the color corresponding to ""dax,"" which in this context is ""green,"" as shown in ""dax walm wif bluf"" outputting ""green green green red red.""

Given this information, it seems that ""dax"" translates to ""green"", and when followed by another color word, it causes a repetition of the green corresponding to ""dax,"" not the other color word.

Rule: dax -> green. When dax precedes a color word, it outputs ""green"" twice. When dax stands alone or is not followed by a distinct color term, it produces ""green"" once.",0.9,116,dax

"bluf -> yellow

Rule: When ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow"". Every other word in the input is either ""green"" or ""red"" depending on a rule not discernible from the given examples. However, ""bluf"" consistently yields ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,116,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems like the meaning of ""bluf"" changes depending on the word it follows or is paired with. To derive a rule, let's look at each example and the corresponding output:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green.""
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
3. The third example is the same as the second, giving us ""yellow yellow"" for ""zup bluf"" once again, confirming a consistency in the rule.
4. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red.""
5. When ""bluf"" is between ""dax"" and ""zup,"" it gives ""green yellow,"" and it seems to repeat the pattern when placed between the same words again.

Considering these examples, we can deduce:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes the color associated with the word it follows. For ""dax,"" it is green, for ""zup,"" it is yellow, and for ""wif,"" it is red. When ""bluf"" occurs multiple times in the sequence, the pattern of color associated with the previous word repeats for each occurrence of ""bluf.""

Hence, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be its ability to adopt the color output associated with the immediately preceding word:

bluf -> mimics the color associated with the preceding word.",0.9,116,bluf
"Analyzing the examples given and looking at the corresponding outputs, it seems that the word ""bluf"" alone does not determine the color output directly; instead, the output is reliant on the whole input. The inputs ""zup bluf"" consistently lead to ""yellow yellow,"" suggesting a rule that applies the same color to both words. However, with the input ""dax bluf zup,"" the output is ""green green yellow,"" which means that ""dax"" and ""bluf"" are resulting in ""green,"" while ""zup"" after ""dax"" results in ""yellow.""

When observing the output for ""wif bluf,"" which is ""red red,"" it indicates that ""bluf"" in this context follows the color of the preceding word (""wif"").

Lastly, the input ""dax bluf zup bluf dax"" results in ""green green yellow yellow green."" This suggests that the occurrence of ""bluf"" after ""zup"" turns it to ""yellow"" but when it follows or precedes ""dax,"" it becomes ""green.""

Putting these observations together, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to depend on the word that precedes it:

- If ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it outputs ""green.""
- If ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it outputs ""yellow.""
- If ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it outputs ""red.""

So, the rule seems largely positional and dependent on the word before ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color output associated with the word immediately preceding it.",0.8,116,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the examples provided and look for patterns associated with ""bluf"" and the outputs.

1. Input: dax bluf zup - Output: green green yellow
2. Input: zup bluf - Output: yellow yellow
3. Input: zup bluf - Output: yellow yellow
4. Input: wif bluf - Output: red red
5. Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax - Output: green green yellow yellow green

First, let's analyze the inputs and outputs alongside the position of ""bluf"":

- Whenever ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""green green."" In the fifth example, when ""dax"" is also followed by ""bluf,"" we still get ""green green yellow.""
- Whenever ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow,"" as seen in examples 2 and 3.
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the output is ""red red.""

Given that ""bluf"" is receiving different output colors based on the words surrounding it, it appears that ""bluf"" replicates the output color of the word that immediately precedes it. We can test this rule by looking at the provided examples:

- ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" so ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green.""
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" so ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow.""
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" so ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red.""
- When ""bluf"" is repeated, as in the fifth example, it continues to replicate the immediate preceding word's color which was ""green"" for ""dax,"" and ""yellow"" for the first ""bluf.""

This suggests the following rule:

bluf -> meaning. Rule: ""bluf"" replicates the output color of the word that comes immediately before it.",0.8,116,bluf
"From the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Let's consider how each example supports this rule:

1. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red"":
The color associated with ""wif"" is ""red,"" and after ""walm"" is mentioned, ""red"" is repeated three times.

2. ""lug dax walm wif"" -> ""blue green green green red"":
Here ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated three times before moving on to the next color associated with ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

3. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"":
Again, the color ""yellow,"" associated with ""zup,"" is repeated three times after ""walm.""

4. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"":
In this example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the associated color ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

5. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" -> ""red red green green red red red blue red"":
The pattern holds as ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""red"" is repeated three times before the sequence continues.

Based on this, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the directly preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> Causes the previous color to be repeated three times.",1.0,116,walm
"walm -> repeat the previously mentioned color three times.

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" is used, the output color is repeated three times in sequence, and it corresponds to the color that is directly before ""walm"" within the input sequence.",1.0,116,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns and outputs given:

1) Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

2) Input: lug dax walm wif
   Output: blue green green green red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

3) Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

4) Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

5) Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" (assuming ""bluf"" is a typo and should be ""bluf"" like in other examples)
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

From the examples, we can see that ""walm"" produces a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, occurring as many times as the number of letters in the preceding word.

For example:
- In the first example, ""wif"" has three letters and corresponds to ""red."" Following ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated three times.
- In the third example, ""zup"" has three letters and corresponds to ""yellow."" Following ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" has three letters and corresponds to ""yellow."" Following ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

Based on the pattern observed in the given examples, the rule will be:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the preceding word for a number of times equal to the number of letters in the preceding word.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, output the color corresponding to that word, repeated as many times as there are letters in that word.",1.0,116,walm

   - ""zup"" still corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and seems to result in ""yellow"" being repeated

4. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug

   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""bluf"" is not directly provided a color but since ""lug bluf"" outputs ""blue blue"" it suggests ""bluf"" may also correspond to ""blue""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and seems to cause ""yellow"" to be repeated
   - The final ""lug"" after the sequence caused by ""walm"" gives ""blue"" again, consistent with other instances

5. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" but appears as ""green"" here; this may be because ""dax"" precedes it, which is ""green"" and could be influencing ""bluf"" (or there could be a typo error)
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and causes ""red"" to be repeated
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   
From these examples, the pattern that emerges is that ""walm"" seems to cause the color word immediately preceding it to be repeated until a new color word appears or the sequence ends. If ""walm"" is directly after a color word, it causes it to repeat. In instances where a color word is not directly repeated (e.g., ""bluf"" once appearing as ""green""), it may be because of a mistake or a missing contextual rule.

Rule:
walm -> causes the preceding color word to repeat until a new color word is encountered or the sentence ends.",0.9,116,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to compare the inputs with the outputs and try to identify any patterns. By looking at the examples provided and their corresponding outputs, we can try to find out the rule or meaning behind the nonce word ""walm.""

Here are the observations:

Input: zup wif walm → Output: yellow red red red
Input: lug dax walm wif → Output: blue green green green red
Input: zup walm → Output: yellow yellow yellow
Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug → Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif → Output: red red green green red red red blue red

From the examples, we can observe the following:

- When ""walm"" is present in the input, the corresponding section of the output is a repetition of a color word.
- The number of repetitions of the color word in the output matches the position of ""walm"" relative to the last color word in the input before ""walm.""

For example, in the input ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" is the word before ""walm,"" and in the output, we see ""yellow"" (the color corresponding to ""zup"") repeated three times. This is because ""walm"" is the third word in the input sequence, and it takes the place of the color that comes right before it.

Rule:
Considering the examples, we can conclude the following rule for ""walm"":

walm → Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" in the input. The number of repetitions is equal to the positional number of ""walm"" in the sequence. If ""walm"" is the nth word in the sequence, repeat the previous color n-1 times.

So, in the above context:

walm -> Repeat the previous color word in the output as many times as its position minus one in the input sequence.",0.9,116,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" in the provided examples always translates to the color ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,117,lug

"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" across all examples provided.",1.0,117,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" is associated with the color green. Whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,117,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green."" Let's examine each example:

- In the first example, the sequence ""zup dax"" results in ""yellow green.""
- In the second example, the presence of ""dax"" yields ""green"" following a yellow sequence.
- The third example starts with ""dax"" and immediately outputs ""green.""
- The fourth example has only ""dax"" and the output is ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" follows ""lug"" and the color ""green"" follows the color ""blue.""

Thus, every time ""dax"" is used in an input, the color ""green"" is present at the corresponding position in the output. From this, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,117,dax
"After analyzing the provided examples, it seems that the presence of the word ""dax"" predicts the color green in the output. Regardless of its position in the input sentence, whenever ""dax"" appears, ""green"" is included in the output sequence at the corresponding position.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,117,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" has a consistent corresponding output across all examples. To identify the rule for ""dax,"" we can compare the Output associated with the Input where ""dax"" is used.

From the examples:

1. ""zup dax walm zup wif"" -> ""yellow green green green yellow red""
2. ""zup walm dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green""
3. ""dax zup walm wif"" -> ""green yellow yellow yellow red""
4. ""dax"" -> ""green""
5. ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" -> ""blue green green yellow blue red""

We can note the following:

- In every instance where ""dax"" appears, the corresponding output is ""green.""
- ""dax"" appears to be independent of its position in the sequence; no matter where ""dax"" is placed, the output is ""green.""
- ""dax,"" when presented alone as input, also has the output of ""green.""

From these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""dax"":

Rule: dax -> green

This indicates that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" and it's a consistent mapping regardless of the position or the surrounding words.",1.0,117,dax
"By analyzing the pattern of input and output color associations, the ""dax"" seems to consistently result in the color ""green."" Across all given examples, when ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" is present in the output at the corresponding location.

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""dax"" is as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,117,dax
"Based on the examples provided, each time the nonce word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. From the examples:

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- In the second example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- In the third example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and also causes the word before it to be repeated in the output (""green green"").
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,117,wif
"Based on the examples given, we can deduce the following:

- In Example 1, the sequence ""lug dax zup dax wif"" corresponds to ""blue green yellow green red."" Here, 'lug', 'dax', and 'zup' align with 'blue', 'green', and 'yellow', respectively, and 'wif' aligns with 'red'.
- In Example 2, ""zup wif bluf"" becomes ""yellow red red."" We know 'zup' is 'yellow'. 'bluf' hasn't been directly defined before, but given that it results in 'red', it may be inferred that 'wif' and 'bluf' both result in 'red'.
- In Example 3, ""zup wif zup dax"" corresponds to ""yellow red yellow green."" Here again, 'zup' and 'dax' align with 'yellow' and 'green', with 'wif' aligning with 'red'.
- In Example 4, ""dax walm wif bluf"" maps to ""green green green red red."" We notice that 'dax' is 'green' and both 'wif' and 'bluf' result in 'red' again. 'walm' is a new word which also corresponds to 'green'.
- In Example 5, ""dax lug bluf wif"" translates to ""green blue blue red."" Once more, 'dax' and 'lug' match 'green' and 'blue', respectively, with 'bluf' and 'wif' both mapping to 'red'.

From these examples, it appears that 'wif' consistently translates to 'red' regardless of its position in the sequence. It could be that 'bluf' has the same translation, but the provided examples do not give us an instance of 'bluf' without 'wif' so we cannot be sure that 'bluf' translates to 'red' independently of 'wif'.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,117,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce a pattern that links the nonce word ""wif"" to a particular output. Examining the outputs following the appearance of ""wif,"" we can make the following observations:

- In the first example, ""wif"" is followed by ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" is also followed by ""red,"" and the word that follows is ""bluf"" which translates to ""red"" again.
- In the third example, ""wif"" precedes ""red"" once more.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" follows ""green"" from ""walm,"" but it is followed by ""bluf"" which means that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" again, and ""bluf"" also translates to ""red.""
- In the fifth example, again ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

This pattern allows us to conclude that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,117,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red.' Every time 'wif' appears in the input, 'red' appears in the output. Here is the rule deduced from the examples:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,117,wif

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it translates to ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,117,zup

"zup -> meaning. Based on the given examples, ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of context.

Rule: zup translates to the color yellow.",1.0,117,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to examine the relationship between the input and the output.

1. Input: zup dax bluf — Output: yellow green green
2. Input: lug bluf — Output: blue blue
3. Input: lug wif bluf — Output: blue red red
4. Input: zup bluf — Output: yellow yellow
5. Input: lug walm wif bluf — Output: blue blue blue red red

Looking at these sequences, it appears that the output is a series of colors, each corresponding somehow to the words in the input. Here's what we can observe:

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, its corresponding color appears twice in a row in the output.
- ""bluf"" follows a word or a pair of words. If the previous word in the input produces a color in the output, ""bluf"" results in that same color being repeated.

Using these observations, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word in the output.

For example:
- In ""zup dax bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, so ""bluf"" results in green being repeated.
- In ""lug bluf,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""bluf"" results in blue being repeated.
- In ""lug wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, so ""bluf"" results in red being repeated.
- In ""zup bluf,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, so ""bluf"" results in yellow being repeated.",1.0,117,bluf
"Given the examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" directly corresponds to the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. If there is no preceding word, it may default to the color associated with the word ""bluf"" itself. Here is the rule based on the examples:

- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is blue.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is yellow.
- When ""wif"" is before ""bluf"", the output is red.

Additionally, if multiple words are in front of ""bluf"", each preceding word gets its corresponding color with ""bluf"" taking the color of the immediate predecessor.

Therefore, the rule in this context seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that comes directly before it in the input sequence. If ""bluf"" is the first word or no other context is provided to infer the color, it defaults to the color associated with ""bluf"" itself, which has not been directly illustrated in the examples but would be consistent with outputs where ""bluf"" is at the end of the input string.

bluf -> meaning. Rule dependent on the context: ""bluf"" indicates a repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word.",0.9,117,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can look at the patterns of the examples provided:

- When ""zup dax bluf"" is the input, the output is ""yellow green green."" Here, the first and second words lead to different color outputs, and the presence of ""bluf"" results in an output color that matches the second word (""dax"" -> ""green,"" ""bluf"" -> ""green"").
- ""lug bluf"" produces ""blue blue,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" gives an output color that matches the color that ""lug"" corresponds to.
- For ""lug wif bluf,"" the output is ""blue red red,"" again showing that ""bluf"" results in repeating the color connected to the preceding word, in this instance, ""wif"" -> ""red.""
- ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" where again ""bluf"" leads to a repeat of the color associated with ""zup.""
- Finally, ""lug walm wif bluf"" provides ""blue blue blue red red,"" where ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word right before it two times (""wif"" -> ""red"").

Based on these examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" induces the repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it in the sequence. If a word is repeated before ""bluf,"" the color associated with it is also repeated as many times as the word appears before ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> The rule is that ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color of the preceding word(s) in the given input sequence. If there is a single word before ""bluf,"" the color of that word is repeated once; if a word appears multiple times consecutively before ""bluf,"" the associated color repeats as many times as the word.",0.9,117,bluf
"Reviewing the examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the word ""bluf"":

1. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green

2. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue

3. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red

4. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow

5. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red

The outputs consist of colors repeated one or more times. Looking at how ""bluf"" affects the output, we see that:

- In examples 1 and 3, after ""bluf"" is mentioned, the last color before ""bluf"" is repeated twice.
- In example 2, ""bluf"" appears after ""lug"", and the color associated with ""lug"" (blue) is repeated once.
- In example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", and the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow) is repeated once.
- In example 5, ""bluf"" appears after several words, and the pattern seems to be that all previously mentioned colors are repeated once, but the last color before ""bluf"" (""wif"" associated with red) is repeated twice.

Based on these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" may instruct to repeat the colors corresponding to the words before ""bluf"", where the last color before ""bluf"" is repeated one extra time. 

So, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat all previous colors once, but repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" an additional time.",0.8,117,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color. However, the color it corresponds to changes depending on the preceding word(s). Here is what we can deduce from the examples:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow,"" suggesting that in this case, ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""
2. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" in this context means ""blue.""
3. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug wif,"" the output is ""blue red red,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" now means ""red.""
4. Finally, when ""bluf"" comes after ""lug walm wif,"" the output is ""blue blue blue red red,"" indicating that ""bluf"" again translates to ""red.""

We can't deduce a solid rule for every context due to limited data, but it seems like ""bluf"" changes its meaning based on the word that comes directly before it. Given that ""lug"" directly before ""bluf"" always results in the color ""blue,"" we might infer that ""lug"" stabilizes the meaning of ""bluf"" to ""blue."" 

However, the additions of ""wif"" and ""walm"" introduce a pattern where ""bluf"" takes on the meaning of ""red."" In the case where ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" it translates to ""yellow."" Overall, though, we do not have enough examples to determine a comprehensive rule for all possible contexts where ""bluf"" might appear.

Thus, a tentative rule could be stated as:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the word directly preceding it: ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" and the combination of ""lug"" with either ""wif"" or ""walm wif"" leads to ""red.""",0.8,117,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color associated with the word directly preceding it. Each time ""walm"" appears in the input, the output repeats the corresponding color for the preceding word the same number of times as ""walm"" appears. Here is the analysis of the examples:

1. ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow"", which indicates ""walm"" takes the color of ""zup"" (yellow) and repeats it three times.
2. ""dax walm wif"" outputs ""green green green red"", where ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax"" (green) three times, followed by the color for ""wif"" (red).
3. ""lug walm wif zup wif"" outputs ""blue blue blue red yellow red"", where ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug"" (blue) three times, and ""wif"" is red, while ""zup"" is yellow.
4. ""dax lug walm"" outputs ""green blue blue blue"", where ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug"" (blue) three times.
5. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" outputs ""yellow red green green green blue"", where ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax"" (green) three times.

Based on this analysis, the rule is:
Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the word directly preceding it, three times.

Therefore:
walm -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,117,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" influences the output by repeating the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it, three times. Each example shows ""walm"" following a word that corresponds to a certain color, and the output then includes that color repeated three times. Here are the observations:

- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"" (indicating ""walm"" after ""zup"" repeats ""yellow"" three times)
- ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green green green red"" (here ""walm"" repeats ""green"", the color associated with ""dax"")
- ""lug walm wif zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue red yellow red"" (showing ""walm"" repeating ""blue"" after ""lug"")
- ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue"" (indicates ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" following ""lug"")
- ""zup wif dax walm lug"" -> ""yellow red green green green blue"" (shows ""walm"" repeating ""green"" after ""dax"")

It's also important to note that no instances show ""walm"" at the beginning of the input, so its behavior at the start of a sequence is unknown.

This leads to the rule:
Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,117,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to trigger the repetition of the next color word three times. The color repetition corresponds to previously established color words: ""zup"" = yellow, ""dax"" = green, and ""lug"" = blue.

For example:

- In ""zup walm"", ""zup"" correlates to yellow, and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In ""dax walm wif"", ""dax"" correlates to green, thus ""walm"" yields ""green green green,"" followed by ""wif,"" which is not defined in the given examples but consistently corresponds to red in the output.

Therefore, based on the examples provided:

walm -> Repeat the color word that follows it three times.",1.0,117,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the pattern in the inputs and outputs.

1. When ""zup"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"".
2. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""green green green"".
3. When ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""blue blue blue"".
4. ""wif"" after ""walm"" adds a ""red"" to the sequence of colors tied to the word preceding ""walm"".

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes just before it. The number of repetitions is three, as we see by the threefold repetition of the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"". When ""wif"" follows ""walm"", it interrupts this pattern by inserting a ""red"".

This leads us to the following rule:

walm -> meaning: The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to repeat three times.

Rule: If ""wif"" follows ""walm"", append a ""red"" to the sequence.",0.9,117,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to correspond to the repeating of the color associated with the word directly preceding it three times. 

Examples that support this rule:
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" (zup corresponds to the color yellow, which is repeated three times).
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"" (dax corresponds to the color green, which is repeated three times).

- In ""lug wif lug bluf"", ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which has been associated with the color blue earlier in the sequence. In this context, ""bluf"" translates to blue.

- The fourth example is more complex, but by matching each known word to its color (""wif"" to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue""), we can see that both instances of ""bluf"" result in ""green."" This initially seems to contradict our earlier inference, so we might need to review the data.
- The fifth example reaffirms the ""zup bluf"" to ""yellow yellow"" pattern, suggesting the fourth example might contain an anomaly or there is additional contextual information that we are not privy to.

Considering the consistent appearance of ""yellow"" after ""bluf"" except in the fourth example, where there seems to be a discrepancy, the most likely rule is that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" unless affected by an unknown factor in the fourth input set.

Rule: bluf -> yellow (with potential exceptions or context-specific variations not clearly outlined in the provided examples).",0.8,118,bluf
"Based on the examples given, we can deduce that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that immediately precedes it.

1. In the first example, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output for ""dax"" is green, so ""bluf"" outputs yellow.

2. In the second example, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" and ""lug"" yields blue; therefore, ""bluf"" translates to blue as well.

3. The third example is the same as the first with ""zup"" preceding ""bluf"" and yielding yellow.

4. In the fourth example, there are two instances of ""bluf,"" each preceded by ""wif."" Since ""wif"" yields red, both instances of ""bluf"" output red.

5. The fifth example repeats the third, further confirming the pattern.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes on the color output of whatever word comes before it.

Rule: bluf -> The color corresponding to the word that precedes it.",0.0,118,bluf
"To determine the rule, let's analyze the given input-output pairs and try to find a pattern:

Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" may correspond to ""blue"" (based on this example)
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""walm"" may correspond to ""red"" (based on this example)
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" may correspond to ""yellow"" (based on this example)
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""walm"" may correspond to ""green"" (based on this example)

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" may correspond to ""blue"" (based on this example)
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Based on the examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" takes on the color value of the word that directly precedes it.

Rule: walm -> takes the color value of the previous word in the sequence. If there is no previous word, it cannot be determined based on the given examples.",1.0,118,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the next color word to be repeated three times. Here's how we can deduce the rule:

- In the first and the third examples, ""lug walm zup"" and ""zup walm lug wif bluf,"" ""walm"" comes before ""zup"" and ""lug"" which correlate to the colors yellow and blue respectively, and both are repeated thrice.
- In the second and the fourth examples, ""wif walm dax"" and ""dax walm,"" we see that ""walm"" comes before ""dax"" and ""wif,"" which correspond to the colors green and red, and again, those colors are repeated thrice.

The last example, ""dax lug walm zup wif,"" confirms the rule because ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" which is yellow, and it is repeated three times followed by another color for ""wif"" which is red.

Rule: walm -> causes the color word that follows it to be repeated three times.",1.0,118,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" functions as a command that causes the following word to be repeated three times in the output based on a color code. The color code is consistent for each unique input word.

Here's the breakdown:
- ""lug walm zup"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow"" (lug -> blue, walm causes next word replication, zup -> yellow)
- ""wif walm dax"" -> ""red red red green"" (wif -> red, walm causes next word replication, dax -> green)
- ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"" (zup -> yellow, walm causes lug to repeat as blue, wif -> red, bluf -> red)
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"" (dax -> green, walm causes dax to repeat)
- ""dax lug walm zup wif"" -> ""green blue blue blue yellow red"" (dax -> green, lug -> blue, walm causes zup to repeat as blue, wif -> red)

Rule: walm -> causes the next word to be repeated three times based on its assigned color in the output.",1.0,118,walm
"walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word. Rule: The word 'walm' causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated for the number of times the 'walm' word appears. For example, 'lug walm' results in 'blue blue', 'wif walm dax' results in 'red red red', and so forth. If 'walm' is preceded by a sequence of words, it repeats the color of the last word in that sequence, as seen with 'zup walm lug wif bluf', resulting in 'yellow yellow yellow'.",1.0,118,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" causes the preceding word to be repeated three times in the output with the color that corresponds to the original single instance of the word. Whether the word comes before or after ""walm,"" it doesn't change the fact that it will be outputted three times, followed by the color associated with ""walm."" 

Therefore, for the word ""lug,"" which corresponds to the color blue, when ""walm"" follows it, we get ""blue blue blue."" Similarly, ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""dax"" to green, and ""zup"" to yellow. The pattern is consistent across all examples.

In cases where multiple words precede ""walm,"" each word is repeated three times in the output with its corresponding color.

However, there is a slight inconsistency with the last example, where ""wif"" corresponds to red, but the output shows only one ""red"" instead of three, following the three ""yellows"" for ""zup."" This inconsistency might be a typo or error in the provided data.

Considering the consistency of other examples, the error in the last example, and based on the information given, the rule inducible from these examples would be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the preceding word to be repeated three times in the output with its corresponding color, and ""walm"" itself corresponds to its own color, which follows the repetition.

Walm -> ""Repeat the preceding word three times in the output with its corresponding color, then add walm's own color."" 

Now, we need to determine what color ""walm"" corresponds to. In all examples, ""walm"" is followed by the color green (except in the last example, where it is assumed an error was made). Hence, ""walm"" likely corresponds to the color green.

Final Rule:
Walm -> meaning: ""Repeat the preceding word three times in the output with its corresponding color, followed by green.""",0.9,118,walm
"lug -> blue

"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.",1.0,119,lug
"Based on the examples, the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" So the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,119,dax
"Based on the provided examples, each distinct word appears to correspond to a specific color. Here's the breakdown of what each word translates to:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green

Now, using these translations, we can create a rule that matches each nonce word to its color output.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,119,dax
"Based on the examples provided, here are the observations:

1. When ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output is ""green blue.""
   - Input: dax lug -> Output: green blue
  
2. When ""dax"" is followed by ""wif zup bluf wif walm,"" the output sequence begins with ""green"" and continues with the sequence for the following words.
   - Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

3. When ""dax"" is followed by ""zup,"" the output is ""green yellow.""
   - Input: dax zup -> Output: green yellow

4. When ""dax"" precedes ""wif,"" the output is ""green red.""
   - Input: wif dax -> Output: red green
   - *(Note the inversion of the normal ""dax then wif"" order which yields ""green then red""; in this case, ""wif"" precedes ""dax"" and the output accordingly begins with ""red."")*

5. When ""dax"" is sandwiched between ""wif"" and ""lug,"" the output is ""red green blue.""
   - Input: wif lug dax lug -> Output: red blue green blue
   - *(Here, ""dax"" follows a ""lug"" and precedes another ""lug,"" but the rule for ""dax,"" which is green, remains consistent.)*

From these observations, the rule that can be induced for ""dax"" is as follows:

Rule: dax translates to the color green, regardless of the words that precede or follow it in the sequence.

So, the rule is:
dax -> green",1.0,119,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in all the given examples.",1.0,119,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

Every instance where ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green."" This consistency across all examples suggests that ""dax"" translates to the color ""green,"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,119,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" The rules for the other words appear consistent where each word corresponds to a specific color as well:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the previous color, in this case, ""blue blue""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,119,wif
"Based on the examples provided, I will deduce the rule that is applied to the word ""wif.""

1. `lug wif lug bluf` -> `blue red blue blue`
Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" inserts a ""red"" between the first ""lug"" (blue) and the second ""lug"" (blue).

2. `dax wif` -> `green red`
Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" is followed by ""red.""

3. `lug wif zup wif` -> `blue red yellow red`
Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" Between ""lug"" and ""zup,"" and after ""zup,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

4. `dax wif` -> `green red`
Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" reinforcing the rule observed in the second example.

5. `wif zup bluf lug walm` -> `red yellow yellow blue blue blue`
Here, ""wif"" appears at the start and is followed by ""red."" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" to ""blue,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" ""Walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word before it, hence ""blue blue."" Since ""wif"" is at the beginning, it appears to still correspond to ""red.""

Based on these examples, ""wif"" seems to correspond to the color ""red"" every time it appears. Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,119,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,119,wif
"Rule: wif -> red

Each instance of ""wif"" in the examples translates to ""red"" in the output.",1.0,119,wif
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" serves as a delimiter between two colors, consistently translating to the color 'red'. Here is the breakdown:

- In the first input, ""lug wif lug bluf"", lug represents blue, and wif represents red, creating a pattern of ""blue red blue blue"".

- In the second input, ""dax wif"", dax corresponds to green, followed by wif which translates to red, creating ""green red"".

- The third example, ""lug wif zup wif"", again shows us that lug is blue, zup is yellow, and wif is red, resulting in ""blue red yellow red"".

- The fourth example repeats the second, ""dax wif"", reinforcing the notion that dax is green and wif is red, yielding ""green red"".

- Finally, in the fifth input, ""wif zup bluf lug walm"", wif is red, zup is yellow, bluf is repeated as a translation for blue, lug once more is blue, and walm seems to consist of repeated blues, thus ""red yellow blue blue blue"".

From these observations, we can extrapolate the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,119,wif
"Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"". So, the rule is:

zup -> yellow",1.0,119,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Every time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. There are no instances where ""zup"" results in a different color or where context alters its meaning. Thus, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,119,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position within the input sequence.",1.0,119,zup

From the examples provided:

- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""walm"" does not have an individual example, but it's observed to correspond to the color ""blue"" in the last example and only appears once.

The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in each example. Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" would be:

Rule: zup -> yellow

Each occurrence of ""zup"" is systematically replaced with the color ""yellow"" in the output.",1.0,119,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in every instance it appears in the examples provided.",1.0,119,zup
"Analyzing the provided input-output pairs:

4. Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> Output: green blue yellow red red green
5. Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax -> Output: green green yellow yellow green

Let's find out what ""bluf"" means in each sequence.

- In the first and third examples, ""bluf"" is followed by colors: ""bluf zup"" translates to ""red yellow"" and ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"". This shows that ""bluf"" might adopt the color value of the word that follows or precedes it.
- In the second example, ""bluf wif"" corresponds to ""green red"". Here, ""bluf"" takes the value ""green"" which is the same as the word ""dax"" before it, supporting the idea that ""bluf"" takes on the color value of adjacent words.
- The fourth example should clear any ambiguity left since ""bluf dax"" translates to ""red green"" which confirms the pattern that ""bluf"" takes the color value of the next word when followed by a word and possibly that of the preceding word when it is the last word in the sequence.
- The fifth example further solidifies this rule because ""bluf zup"" and ""zup bluf"" both translate to ""green yellow"" and ""yellow green"", respectively, showing that ""bluf"" matches the color of the adjacent word, be it after or before.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it takes on the color value of the word immediately next to it in the sequence, whether that word is before or after ""bluf"".

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color value of the adjacent word.",1.0,119,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color 'red' when it is preceded by the word ""wif"", and to the color 'green' when it is preceded by the word ""dax"". When ""bluf"" is not preceded by either ""wif"" or ""dax"", it takes on the color 'blue'. 

Rule:

1. In ""zup walm lug,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" ""Zup"" is followed by three yellows and ""lug"" is followed by blue, suggesting that ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""lug"" corresponds to blue.

2. In ""lug walm zup walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow."" Since ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, this further suggests that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color of the word that follows it. 

3. In ""lug walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue,"" reinforcing the idea that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the following word (""lug"" which is blue) to be repeated.

4. In ""wif walm dax zup,"" the output is ""red red red green yellow."" This suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""dax"" to green, and ""zup"" to yellow. The presence of ""walm"" after ""wif"" again causes the preceding color (red) to repeat.

5. In ""wif walm zup,"" the output is ""red red red yellow,"" showing the same pattern of repetition due to ""walm"" and confirming the associations of colors with the other words (""wif"" to red and ""zup"" to yellow).

Rule:

Rule: walm -> repeating the color of the previous word thrice.,1.0,120,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the presence of the word ""walm"" in an input sequence corresponds to a series of ""green"" in the output sequence. The number of times ""green"" is repeated in the output seems to be one less than the total number of words in the input sequence preceding ""walm."" In other words, ""walm"" seems to signal the output of a ""green"" for every word that comes before it, up to ""walm,"" excluding ""walm"" itself.

Here's how this pattern fits each example:

- In ""zup dax walm,"" there are two words before ""walm,"" so the output has two ""green"" after the colors corresponding to ""zup"" and ""dax.""
- In ""dax walm,"" there is one word before ""walm,"" so the output has one ""green"" after the color corresponding to ""dax.""
- In ""wif lug zup walm wif lug,"" ""walm"" is preceded by three words, resulting in three ""green"" in the sequence before the colors that correspond to ""wif"" and ""lug"" after ""walm.""
- In ""lug dax zup dax walm wif,"" there are four words before ""walm,"" leading to four ""green"" before the color for ""wif.""
- In ""wif zup walm dax zup,"" there are two words before ""walm,"" hence there are two ""green"" before the sequence continues with the colors for the remaining words.

"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""lug"" correlates with the color ""blue."" Here are the relationships in the provided examples:

- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".
- ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the previous color, as seen in examples 2 and 4, where ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and ""lug"" respectively, and the output color repeats.

Therefore, the rule for ""lug"" seems to be:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,121,lug

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax"", I will correlate the appearance of ""dax"" in the input with the corresponding output and identify any consistent pattern.

Examining the examples:

1. ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"". The repetition of ""green"" seems to indicate that both ""dax"" and ""walm"" translate to ""green"".

2. ""zup dax walm zup wif"" becomes ""yellow green green green yellow red"". ""Dax"" appears between ""zup"" and ""walm"" which each produced ""yellow"" and ""green"", respectively, in the outputs. ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

3. ""wif dax zup wif"" becomes ""red green yellow red"". Here, ""dax"" is followed by ""zup"", and the outputs are ""green"" followed by ""yellow"".

4. ""dax"" on its own results in ""green"".

5. ""dax bluf"" produces ""green green"". This suggests ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green"" similarly to ""walm"".

Every example containing ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green"". This suggests that ""dax"" directly translates to ""green"" irrespective of other words in the sequence. There are no instances in the given examples indicating otherwise.

Input: dax wif walm -> Output: green red red red 
Here, ""dax"" likely translates to ""green"" and ""wif"" remains as ""red"". ""Walm"" would then translate to ""red red red"", but this seems inconsistent with the other examples. It's possible that each occurrence of ""walm"" translates to ""red"", which would be supported if ""wif walm"" is viewed as ""red red"". But there's insufficient data to confirm this.

Input: wif -> Output: red 
Again confirms that ""wif"" translates to ""red"".

Based on the provided examples:

- When we have ""zup bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" takes on the meaning of ""yellow"" following ""zup.""
- With ""dax bluf,"" the output is ""green green,"" indicating that ""bluf"" here translates to ""green"" after ""dax.""
- In the case of ""zup bluf wif walm,"" ""bluf"" directly follows ""zup"" and therefore becomes ""yellow."" But ""walm"" doesn't directly precede or follow ""bluf,"" and there's no example of ""walm bluf"" or ""bluf walm."" However, based on the output ""red red red"" for ""wif walm,"" it could be inferred that ""walm"" itself corresponds to ""red,"" although this pattern is not about ""bluf.""

If ""bluf"" always corresponds to the color of the word immediately before it, then in the sequence where ""bluf"" appears first (such a sequence is not provided in the examples), it would logically take the color of the word immediately following it, since there is no preceding color to mirror.

Therefore, the rule can be extended as follows: If ""bluf"" were to appear at the beginning of a sequence, we would look to the word immediately after it to determine its color.

Here's the rule breakdown:

- ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" translates to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue."" The ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which is blue, so ""walm"" results in repeated blue.

- ""lug walm"" becomes ""blue blue blue"" because ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which is blue and continues the blue color.

- ""lug dax walm"" translates to ""blue green green green."" The ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which is green, leading to repeated green.

- ""zup walm"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow"" since ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which is assigned yellow, repeating the color yellow.

- ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" translates to ""red red green green red red red blue red."" The “walm” follows “wif” which is red, thus repeating the color red before ""lug"" which is blue and then followed by ""wif"" which reintroduces red.

Rule: walm -> the color of the word preceding it, repeated as many times as the instances of ""walm"" until a new color word appears.",1.0,121,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can notice that ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of a color word that corresponds to the word that comes immediately before ""walm."" Here is the analysis of each example:

1. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (which is blue) and produces two more ""blue""s.

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - The color ""blue"" is repeated three times, and the only color word before ""walm"" is ""lug.""

3. Input: lug dax walm

5. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (which is red) and results in two more ""red""s.

So the rule seems to be: ""walm"" causes the color word before it to be repeated twice more.

Rule: walm -> Causes the previous color word to repeat two additional times.",1.0,121,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" means to repeat the color of the previous word in the sequence for as many times as there are letters in the word ""walm."" Therefore, since ""walm"" has four letters, it repeats the color of the previous word four times.

Here's the breakdown based on examples:

1. ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" -> yellow green blue (blue blue blue blue) yellow blue
2. ""lug walm"" -> blue (blue blue blue)
3. ""lug dax walm"" -> blue green (green green green)
4. ""zup walm"" -> yellow (yellow yellow yellow)

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word four times.",1.0,121,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" indicates repetition of the color associated with the preceding word for a number of times equal to the number of letters in the preceding word.

Explanation:
1. In the first example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"", indicating that ""walm"" causes the preceding color (blue) to be repeated three times (since ""lug"" has three letters).

2. In the third example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"", showing that ""walm"" again causes repetition of the preceding color (green) four times (since ""dax"" has four letters).

3. In the fourth example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"", with ""walm"" causing the repetition of the preceding color (yellow) three times (as ""zup"" has three letters).

Thus, considering all the provided examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems consistent with causing a repetition of the preceding color for a count that matches the number of letters in the word before ""walm"".",1.0,121,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color word that precedes it to be repeated for a count equal to the number of letters in the color word. 

For example:
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" represents ""blue,"" which has four letters and is therefore repeated four times.
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" represents ""yellow,"" which has six letters and is therefore repeated six times.
- In ""lug dax walm,"" ""dax"" represents ""green,"" which has five letters, so ""green"" is repeated five times, not counting the original occurrence. 

Based on this rule:

walm -> causes the previous color word to repeat a number of times equal to the number of letters in that color word.",1.0,121,walm

Rule: dax -> green,1.0,122,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,122,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green."" In every instance where ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. No other words or positions consistently produce ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,122,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following:

Input: dax zup
Output: green yellow
From this we can see that ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".

Input: lug zup dax lug dax
Output: blue yellow green blue green
Here, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", as it is consistent both times it appears. ""dax"" again translates to ""green"".

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red
This supports our previous deduction that ""dax"" is ""green"". It appears that ""wif"" may correspond to ""red"" as its appearance results in ""red"" in the output.

Input: wif zup wif dax
Output: red yellow red green
This further supports our deductions. ""wif"" yields ""red"", ""zup"" yields ""yellow"", and ""dax"" yields ""green"".

The following associations can be observed:

- ""wif"" -> red (in all examples where ""wif"" appears, the output includes ""red"")
- ""lug"" -> blue (based on the second and fifth example, each occurrence of ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"")
- ""walm"" -> blue (in the second and fifth example, each instance of ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the output is another ""blue"")
- ""bluf"" -> red (only found in the second example, positioned after ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"" and the output is another ""red"")
- ""zup"" -> yellow (only found in the fourth example, after ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red,"" followed by ""yellow"" in the output)

Given this information, the rule appears to be:

Rule: Each nonce word corresponds to a specific color in the output sequence. ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".",1.0,122,wif
"Based on the input and output examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red."" Additionally, it seems other nonce words correspond to different colors as well. For example, ""lug walm"" corresponds to a series of ""blue,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Here's a breakdown of the observed correspondences:

- ""wif"" outputs ""red"" whenever it appears.
- ""lug walm"" together outputs a sequence of ""blue"" repeated twice.
- ""zup"" outputs ""yellow.""

With the available data, we can therefore deduce the rule for ""wif"":

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,122,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by analyzing its usage and the corresponding outputs.

Example Analysis:

1. Input: wif | Output: red

3. Input: wif | Output: red
4. Input: wif zup | Output: red yellow
5. Input: wif lug walm | Output: red blue blue blue

From these examples, we can observe that every time ""wif"" is mentioned in the input, ""red"" is included in the output. Other words such as ""lug"" and ""walm"" seem to correspond to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" is paired with ""yellow.""

So, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Other words may have their own color associations, but since we are focusing on the term ""wif,"" we can ignore them for this analysis.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,122,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce a pattern correlating the nonce word ""wif"" and the colors mentioned in the outputs.

Here's a breakdown of the given examples:

- When ""wif"" appears on its own, the output is a single color ""red"".
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""lug walm"" (wif lug walm), each word corresponds to a color and ""wif"" is repeated for the number of words following it (red blue blue blue).
- When ""wif"" precedes ""zup"" (wif zup), the output is ""red yellow"", indicating that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

From these observations, we can derive the meaning of ""wif"" as follows:

**wif -> red.** The rule is that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"", and if there are additional words following ""wif"", it repeats the red color for each word before taking on the new color associated with the new word.

Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" and repeats for the number of words that follow it. Each additional word has its own associated color, which gets placed after the sequence of reds induced by ""wif"".",0.9,122,wif

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns before and after the word in the input and the corresponding output. Focusing on the relationship between the input and output colors, it appears that ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the output, regardless of the words that appear around it. This suggests that ""bluf"" is not dependent on context. Here's the rule based on the provided data:

"walm -> three repetitions of color associated with the preceding word. Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word that comes before it to be repeated three times.",1.0,122,walm
"From the examples given, the rule appears to be that the word ""walm"" results in the output of three repetitions of a color. The color that is repeated three times seems to depend on the word that comes before ""walm."" 

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" so with the word ""lug,"" the color blue is repeated three times.
- In the second and third examples, ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" so with the word ""zup,"" the color yellow is repeated three times.
- The fourth example confirms the rule with ""lug wif dax zup walm"" giving the output of blue (for ""lug""), red (for ""wif""), green (for ""dax""), followed by three yellows (for ""zup walm""). This demonstrates that ""wif"" and ""dax"" correspond to red and green respectively, while ""zup walm"" still corresponds to three yellows.
- The fifth example ""lug walm zup walm"" again shows ""lug walm"" resulting in ""blue blue blue"" and ""zup walm"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" reinforcing the rule.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"" as:

Rule: When following the word ""walm,"" repeat the associated color three times as follows: ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and so on for any other words that have an associated color.

2. In ""wif zup bluf,"" we get ""red yellow yellow,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" again.
3. ""wif lug walm"" translates to ""red blue blue blue,"" which implies ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""lug walm"" is associated with repeated ""blue.""
4. ""zup wif zup"" outputs ""yellow red yellow,"" with ""wif"" again corresponding to ""red.""
5. ""wif walm"" gives ""red red red,"" indicating ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""walm"" also translates to repeated ""red.""

From these examples, regardless of the context in which it is used, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,123,wif
"From the examples provided, it can be discerned that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"". Additionally, it seems that the other words have a consistent translation as well: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", and ""walm"" translates to ""blue"" multiple times (and possibly indicates a repetition of ""blue""). The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"". 

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red",1.0,123,wif
"Based on the given examples, wif consistently translates to the word ""red."" Each time wif appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: wif -> ""red""",1.0,123,wif
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Every time the word 'zup' appears in the input, the output is 'yellow'.",1.0,123,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: Regardless of context in the given examples, ""zup"" always translates to the color ""yellow"".",1.0,123,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Each occurrence of the word ""zup"" is translated as ""yellow"" in the outputs provided. There is a one-to-one correspondence where every ""zup"" equates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words.",1.0,123,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word zup translates to the color yellow regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,123,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" directly translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the context.",1.0,123,zup
"To ascertain the meaning or rule for ""bluf,"" we must analyze the patterns in the provided examples and their corresponding outputs. Let's start by examining each instance where ""bluf"" appears:

1. Input: dax zup bluf  
   Output: green yellow yellow  
   * Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the last ""yellow.""

2. Input: zup bluf wif  
   Output: yellow yellow red  
   * Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""yellow.""

3. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf  
   Output: yellow red green red red  
   * Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the last ""red.""

4. Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax  
   Output: red red yellow red blue green  
   * Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red.""

5. Input: dax walm wif bluf  
   Output: green green green red red  
   * Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the first ""red.""

Looking at the patterns, ""bluf"" does not correspond to a consistent color in the output. Instead, it seems that the color output for ""bluf"" is dependent on the preceding word's output. If we inspect further, we notice that in every case, ""bluf"" has the same output color as the word that comes immediately before it:

1. Input: dax zup bluf  
   zup -> yellow, bluf -> yellow

2. Input: zup bluf wif  
   zup -> yellow, bluf -> yellow

3. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
   wif -> red, bluf -> red

4. Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
   wif -> red, bluf -> red

5. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   wif -> red, bluf -> red

Rule: bluf takes on the color output of the word that immediately precedes it.

Bluf -> meaning. Meaning: ""bluf"" results in an output color that matches the output color of the word before it.",1.0,123,bluf
"Examining the examples provided where the nonce word `bluf` is used, it is possible to infer a rule for its meaning based on the color outputs associated with it in various contexts. Here are the examples again for reference:

1. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow

2. Input: zup bluf wif
   Output: yellow yellow red

3. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow red green red red

4. Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
   Output: red red yellow red blue green

5. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red

Looking at these examples, the output color that corresponds to ""bluf"" changes, which implies that ""bluf"" does not have a consistent color output like ""dax"" does (which is consistently ""green""). However, in every case, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

Based on the data, the rule can thus be stated as:

Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red."" 

Therefore:

bluf -> red",1.0,123,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, I will infer the meaning of ""bluf"" by comparing the inputs and their corresponding outputs to identify the rule.

Here are the observed patterns:

1. Every time ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
2. Every time ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red.""
3. ""zup"" appears and the output is ""yellow.""
4. ""lug"" is associated with the output ""blue.""

Now let's analyze the occurrences of ""bluf"":

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the color yellow is repeated in the output.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" precedes ""wif"" and the output is red, which is associated with ""wif.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" and ""dax,"" and before another ""wif."" The color associated with ""bluf"" here is red, matching the rule for ""wif.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup"" and the output for ""bluf"" is red, followed by yellow for ""zup.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows two ""wif"" and the output is red for both, following the pattern for ""wif.""

From these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" does not have a fixed color associated with it, but rather, its output seems dependent on the word (or the color associated with the word) that follows it. Notably, when ""bluf"" precedes ""wif,"" the output is red, and when it precedes ""zup,"" the output is yellow. This suggests that the color following ""bluf"" is determined by the color associated with the next word in sequence.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color associated with the next word's output. If the next word outputs red, then ""bluf"" is red; if the next word outputs yellow, then ""bluf"" is yellow; and so on.",0.8,123,bluf
"Rule: ""bluf"" maps to ""red"".",0.6,123,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" is associated with a color output that changes depending on the context. Let's look at the occurrences:

- In the first example, when ""bluf"" appears after ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" also follows ""zup"" and the output is again ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is at the end, and the output is ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" again and the output is ""red.""

However, the context provided is not sufficient to derive a rule for ""bluf"" that covers all cases with certainty. The occurrences of ""bluf"" do not show a clear, consistent pattern that correlates to a single color output. Given that ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" in both the fourth and fifth examples and the color is ""red"" both times, there might be a rule that says ""wif"" followed by ""bluf"" results in ""red."" However, this rule does not hold in other contexts where ""bluf"" is not immediately preceded by ""wif.""

Given the conflicting information and limited context, we can't deduce a definitive rule for ""bluf,"" but we can observe that it possibly takes on different colors depending on the preceding word. To deduce a rule with confidence, we'd need more examples or additional context. For now, we can only hypothesize that:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" may change depending on the word(s) immediately preceding it; it is context-dependent, but the exact rule cannot be determined with the given examples.",0.5,123,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to examine the relationship between the input and the output. It appears as though ""walm"" is responsible for the repetition of a color word corresponding to the input that precedes it. Each example has a unique color repeated three times, followed by a fourth color if there is a third input word. Here's the pattern:

- ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- ""dax walm wif"" produces ""green green green red.""
- ""zup walm lug"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow blue.""
- ""lug walm dax"" produces ""blue blue blue green.""
- ""wif walm"" produces ""red red red.""

From these examples, it looks like the word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times. The only time we see a fourth color is when there is a third word in the input sequence, which then produces the color associated with that third word.

The word preceding ""walm"" determines the color:
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Therefore, we can surmise that:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,123,walm
"walm -> triple repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: When the word 'walm' follows a color-associated word, the output is that color repeated three times.",1.0,123,walm
"walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word thrice.

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word that precedes it to be repeated three times in the output.",1.0,123,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following correspondences:

- ""zup"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""dax"" leads to ""green green green""
- ""lug"" leads to ""blue blue blue""
- ""wif"" leads to ""red red red""

It is clear that each word corresponds to three repetitions of a color. The presence of the word ""walm"" in each input does not change the color that is output, thus we can induce that ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,123,walm
"walm -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times. Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" indicates that the color word that comes before ""walm"" should be repeated three times in the output.",1.0,123,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" we will look for patterns in the inputs and outputs:

1. Whenever ""lug"" appears, the color ""blue"" is always in the output.
2. No other input word correlates consistently with ""blue.""

From this observation, we can hypothesize that ""lug"" correlates with the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,124,lug
"Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""",1.0,124,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" I'll look for patterns where it occurs in the input and the corresponding output colors.

1. ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif"" -> ""blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red""
2. ""dax zup lug wif lug"" -> ""green yellow blue red blue""
3. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
4. ""zup walm dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green blue""
5. ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" -> ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow""

Considering example 1, the first ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and the second ""lug"" also corresponds to ""blue,"" despite being separated by ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red.""

Looking at example 2, ""lug"" appears twice and corresponds to ""blue"" each time, despite being surrounded by different words.

Example 3 shows ""lug"" followed by ""walm,"" with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" to ""blue.""

In example 4, ""lug"" is the last word and corresponds to ""blue.""

Finally, in example 5, ""lug"" is followed by ""wif"" and corresponds to ""blue,"" while ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

From these observations, we can induce that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue,"" regardless of its position or surrounding words. Therefore, we can conclude:

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,124,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"". The presence of ""lug"" consistently results in the word ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""lug"" in the input sequence or the words that come before or after it.

Therefore, the rule appears to be: lug -> blue.",1.0,124,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" we will examine the outputs where ""lug"" is present and compare them to the adjacent words and outputs. Let's look for a pattern:

1. lug wif lug walm zup walm wif -> blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
2. dax zup lug wif lug -> green yellow blue red blue
3. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
4. zup walm dax lug -> yellow yellow yellow green blue
5. wif walm zup lug wif walm zup -> red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

It appears that each time ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue."" Additionally, when comparing the outputs to the non-""lug"" words, we can't see a dependency on position or surrounding words for this output. Based on the given examples, ""lug"" seems to be consistently translated to the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,124,lug
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's look for patterns concerning the word and its relation to the output colors.

First example:
Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
Output: red green yellow red green green

In this example, ""dax"" appears twice and corresponds to ""green"" both times. The pattern also suggests that ""wif"" correlates to ""red"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Second example:
Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
Output: blue green yellow green green green red

Similarly, ""dax"" results in ""green"" every time. ""Zup"" is consistent with ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" with ""blue."" ""Wif"" at the end is ""red,"" consistent with the first example.

Third example:
Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow

""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and ""walm"" seems to follow with another ""green,"" while ""wif"" aligns with ""red,"" consistent with previous examples, and ""zup"" with ""yellow.""

Fourth example:
Input: lug wif dax walm zup
Output: blue red green green green yellow

Once more, ""dax"" is followed by ""green,"" and the other words' colors remain consistent with the previous examples.

Fifth example:
Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" Following the pattern, ""walm"" should then lead to ""green,"" but instead, it results in additional ""blue"" colors.

From these examples, the clear rule for ""dax"" seems to be that it consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,124,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce a rule for the nonce word 'dax' by identifying patterns that correlate with its appearance and the resulting colors in the output.

Looking at the output strings, we notice that 'dax' consistently corresponds to the color 'green'.

For example:
- In the first input, 'dax' appears twice and in the output, 'green' also appears twice in the same positions.
- In the second input, 'dax' appears twice and is followed by 'green' twice.
- Similarly, in the rest of the inputs, every occurrence of 'dax' matches up with 'green' in the output.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: dax -> 'green' (Dax consistently corresponds to the color green in the output, no matter its position in the input.)",1.0,124,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to look for patterns in the given examples. Let's analyze when ""dax"" appears and what color follows it in the output.

1. ""wif dax"" -> ""red green""
2. ""dax zup"" -> ""green yellow""
3. ""lug dax"" -> ""blue green""
4. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green""
5. ""dax lug"" -> ""green blue""

The word ""dax"" is always followed by ""green"" in the output, regardless of the word that comes before or after it in the input. Therefore, we can infer that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

dax -> ""green"". Rule: The word ""dax"" represents the color ""green.""",1.0,124,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's observe its position and the corresponding output colors in the given examples:

1. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
   Output: red green yellow red green green
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds with the color green both times it appears.

2. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red
   Again, ""dax"" corresponds with the color green in both instances.

3. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   ""Dax"" at the beginning is green, and ""walm"" and ""wif"" are subsequently red.

4. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
   ""Dax"" corresponds with green, and its presence doesn’t seem to influence the colors following it.

5. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   ""Dax"" is associated with green again.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""dax"" seems consistent across all examples provided. It consistently translates to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,124,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look for patterns associated with ""dax"" and the subsequent colors in the output.

- When ""dax"" appears, the corresponding output is always ""green"".
- ""dax"" itself doesn't seem to influence the color that comes after it, as that color can be different (yellow, green, blue, etc.).

From this, we can infer that ""dax"" corresponds directly to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the context it is used in.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,124,dax
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" is consistently mapped to the output ""red."" Thus, the rule is:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""red.""",1.0,124,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Each time ""wif"" is present in an input, the output includes the color ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,124,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,124,wif
"Based on the given examples, each instance of ""wif"" correlates to an output of ""red."" There is no example where ""wif"" corresponds to a different output. Therefore, the rule seems straightforward.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,124,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red"". There is no variation in the output when ""wif"" appears in the input, regardless of the surrounding words. Therefore, the rule appears to be quite straightforward:

wif -> meaning: ""wif"" means ""red"".

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" is in the input, the output is ""red"".",1.0,124,wif
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,124,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the given outputs. Each time ""zup"" is presented in the input, regardless of the surrounding words, the output is consistently yellow.",1.0,124,zup

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,124,zup

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of context within the provided examples.",1.0,124,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" by comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs. 

Let's observe the instances of ""bluf"" and their outputs consistently.

1. In every example, whenever the word ""bluf"" appears, so does the color mentioned in the output just before.
    - Example 1: ""dax bluf"" corresponds with ""green green""
    - Example 2: ""zup bluf"" corresponds with ""yellow yellow""
    - Example 4: ""zup bluf"" corresponds with ""yellow yellow""
    - Example 5: ""dax bluf"" corresponds with ""green green""

2. ""Bluf"" does not correspond with the same color—its output color changes depending on the word that appears before it.
    - In examples involving ""dax,"" ""bluf"" relates to green.
    - In examples involving ""zup,"" ""bluf"" relates to yellow.
    - When ""lug"" is used, ""bluf"" is not present, but ""lug"" is followed by the color blue in Example 3.

Rule: The word ""bluf"" seems to replicate the color mentioned in the output of the word immediately preceding it.

Therefore, we can infer the following rule for ""bluf"":

Bluf -> meaning: The word ""bluf"" means ""repeat the color associated with the previous word.""",1.0,124,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> repeat the colour associated with the previous word.

Explanation: 

- In the first example, ""dax"" yields a green output, followed by ""bluf"", which yields another green. This suggests that ""bluf"" may cause the repetition of the previous output.
- In the second example, ""zup"" yields a yellow output, followed by ""bluf"" giving another yellow. Again, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the previous color.
- The third and fourth examples reinforce this pattern, where ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and ""zup"" respectively, and both times the color associated with ""lug"" (blue) and ""zup"" (yellow) is repeated.
- The last example is consistent with this rule, where ""dax"" is associated with green, directly followed by ""bluf"" which also gives a green output.

Thus, the rule induced is that ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the word that comes directly before it.",1.0,124,bluf
Rule: bluf -> the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it.,1.0,124,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the common factors associated with the outputs each time the word ""bluf"" appears in the examples.

- In every example where ""bluf"" appears, the output that follows it matches the last color before ""bluf"":
  - ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green""
  - ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow""

- However, when other words follow ""bluf,"" the color sequence is not continued:
  - ""bluf zup"" results in ""yellow yellow green""
  
- ""bluf"" does not seem to match with any predefined color, unlike ""dax"" which consistently matches with ""green"" or ""zup"" which consistently matches with ""yellow"".

Given these observations, ""bluf"" acts as a sort of repeating operator for the previously mentioned color. Thus, we can deduce:

bluf -> meaning. Repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""bluf.""

Rule: When ""bluf"" is used after another word/color, it repeats the color associated with that word. If ""bluf"" is followed by another word, it doesn't affect the color of the word that follows ""bluf."" The specific color associated with ""bluf"" is contingent on the preceding word.",0.9,124,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the examples and their corresponding outputs:

1. ""dax bluf zup bluf dax"" -> ""green green yellow yellow green""
2. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red""
3. ""zup lug bluf"" -> ""yellow blue blue""
4. ""zup bluf lug zup"" -> ""yellow yellow blue yellow""
5. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""

Based on the outputs, we can infer:

- The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- The word sequence ""wif walm"" corresponds to the sequence ""red red.""

""bluf"" appears between other words, and in each instance, the color that follows ""bluf"" in the output corresponds to the color of the word that follows ""bluf"" in the input. For example:

- In the first input, ""dax bluf zup bluf dax,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup"" and then ""dax,"" and in the output, the colors following the color for ""bluf"" (which would be yellow as per this logic) are yellow and green, respectively. But we do not see simply a yellow following the first ""bluf""; there's a green immediately afterward, which corresponds to ""dax.""
- In the second input, ""zup bluf wif walm,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif walm,"" and in the output, the colors following the color for ""bluf"" are reds, which correspond to ""wif walm.""
- In the third input, ""zup lug bluf,"" ""bluf"" comes after ""lug,"" and in the output, the color blue is after the color blue, which corresponds to ""lug.""
- In the fourth input, ""zup bluf lug zup,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" and then ""zup,"" and in the output, after the color for ""bluf,"" we have blue and yellow, corresponding to ""lug"" and ""zup,"" respectively.
- The fifth input, ""dax bluf,"" only includes ""bluf"" following ""dax,"" and in the output, we see green corresponding to ""dax"" again.

From this, we can induce that ""bluf"" means ""repeat the color of the following word."" If there is no word following ""bluf"" (which is not the case in the given examples), we would not have information to deduce its color.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the following word.",0.8,124,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word that precedes it three times, followed by the color associated with the word that follows it. Each input word corresponds to a specific color:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" appears to correspond to ""blue"" as well (assuming this is not a typo for ""lug""), or it might be that we don't have enough information about ""bluf"" to conclude its color, but it can be inferred from the last example. 

Given the examples:

- ""wif walm dax"" (red red red green) means ""red"" is repeated three times because ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and then ""green"" follows because ""dax"" comes after ""walm.""
- ""lug walm zup"" (blue blue blue yellow) means ""blue"" is repeated three times because ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and then ""yellow"" follows because ""zup"" comes after ""walm.""
- ""lug walm wif"" (blue blue blue red) means ""blue"" is repeated three times because ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and then ""red"" follows because ""wif"" comes after ""walm.""
- ""wif walm lug bluf"" (red red red blue blue) means ""red"" is repeated three times because ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and then ""blue"" is shown twice, once for ""lug"" and once for ""bluf."" Based on this we can assume ""bluf"" also means ""blue.""
- ""zup walm wif"" (yellow yellow yellow red) means ""yellow"" is repeated three times because ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and then ""red"" follows because ""wif"" comes after ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" three times, followed by the color corresponding to the word after ""walm"".",1.0,124,walm
"Based on the examples provided, where the word ""walm"" appears in the input, it is always followed by a series of identical colors in the output, except for the last color which is different. This last color corresponds to the word following ""walm"" in each input. To establish the rule, we need to map the words before ""walm"" to the color they produce in the output:

- ""wif"" leads to ""red"" in the output.
- ""lug"" leads to ""blue"" in the output.
- ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"" in the output.
- ""bluf"" is not used before ""walm"" but follows ""lug walm"" and results in a ""blue"" (from ""lug"") and then an additional ""blue"" (from ""bluf"").

Given this, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the next word's corresponding color to repeat three times, followed by the color corresponding to the word immediately after ""walm"".

So, for each example:

- ""wif walm dax"" -> ""red red red green"" because ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and although ""dax"" hasn't been defined, we can infer that it would produce ""green"".
- ""lug walm zup"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- ""lug walm wif"" -> ""blue blue blue red"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- ""wif walm lug bluf"" -> ""red red red blue blue"" because ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""blue"", continuing the color series.
- ""zup walm wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow red"" because ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Conclusively,

walm -> The function of ""walm"" is to repeat the color corresponding to the word before it three times, followed by the color corresponding to the word after it.",1.0,124,walm
"walm -> repeats the color of the previous word in the sequence. Rule: When ""walm"" appears in a sequence, it causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated for the number of times ""walm"" appears.",1.0,124,walm
"Walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word. Rule: The color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"" is repeated three times, followed by the color associated with the word immediately after ""walm"". 

For example:
- ""wif walm dax"" translates to ""red red red green"" because ""wif"" is associated with red, which is repeated three times due to ""walm"", followed by ""green"" for ""dax"".
- ""lug walm zup"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow"" because ""lug"" is associated with blue, repeated three times, followed by ""yellow"" for ""zup"".",1.0,124,walm
"From the examples provided, we can hypothesize that ""walm"" is a color transformer or modifier that causes the subsequent word to adopt the color associated with the word ""walm."" Specifically, it seems to repeat or extend the color of the word immediately preceding ""walm."" Here's how we can break it down:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and since ""wif"" corresponds to red, the following word ""dax"" also becomes red.
- In the second example, ""lug"" is associated with blue, and when followed by ""walm,"" the subsequent word ""zup"" becomes yellow, which seems unrelated until we look at the other examples.
- In the third example, ""walm"" again follows ""lug"" (blue), and the next word ""wif"" becomes red. The rule seems consistent here with the first example.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" which is not preceded by ""walm"" is simply translated to blue without transformation.
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with yellow, which changes ""wif"" to red afterward.

However, looking closely, ""walm"" does not transform ""zup"" into yellow in the second example as it does in the fifth example. This inconsistency suggests that there might be a mistake in the second example or that ""walm"" has a more complex rule that is not obvious from the examples given alone.

Nevertheless, the consistent pattern in the other examples shows that ""walm"" affects the color of the word that follows it to reflect the color of the word immediately preceding it. Therefore, based on the examples excluding the second one which seems anomalous, the rule could be formulated as:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the following word to repeat the color of the word immediately before ""walm.""

Thus:

walm -> A modifier that repeats the color of the preceding word for the following word.",0.8,124,walm
lug -> blue. Rule: The word 'lug' corresponds to the color 'blue' in the outputs.,1.0,125,lug

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,125,lug
"lug -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that ""lug"" translates to the word ""blue"".

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the output includes the color ""blue"". ""lug"" on its own translates to a single ""blue"", and ""lug"" followed by another word may result in repetition of the word ""blue"" or additional colors, depending on the other words present. The other words following ""lug"" dictate the number of times ""blue"" is repeated or which other colors are added to the sequence. However, from the data provided here, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to at least one ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,125,lug

2. ""walm"" consistently results in ""blue blue blue"".

4. ""zup"" matches with ""yellow"".

"From the given examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Here's how this deduction lines up with the examples:

Input: wif
Output: red
""Wif"" on its own yields the output ""red"".

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
Again, ""wif"" is the first word and its translation is ""red"".

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red
Here, ""wif"" is in the middle but still corresponds to the color ""red"".

Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf

Rule:

"Based on the provided examples, it can be observed that the output corresponding to the word ""wif"" does not seem to depend on its position or the context of the other words around it. Regardless of its placement, ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red."" Therefore, the rule seems to be quite simple:

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,125,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" every time it appears. Here's the evidence supporting this conclusion:

- Every instance of the word ""wif"" is followed by the color ""red"" in the output.
- No other word in the inputs consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the outputs.
- Other words correspond to different colors or, in some cases, the same word may correspond to different colors depending on their position (like ""dax"" which corresponds to “green” when it comes after ""wif"" but to “red” when it comes after ""walm"").

Therefore, we can deduce:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" represents the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,125,wif
"Rules:

1. The output consists of color words: red, blue, green, and yellow.
2. Each input word corresponds to one color in the output.
3. The word ""wif"" consistently leads to the output ""red.""

Based on the examples:

- ""lug"" leads to the color ""blue"" (seen in the first and fourth examples).
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" (seen in the first, third, and fifth examples).
- ""walm"" results in the color ""green"" (seen in the first and second examples).
- ""zup"" leads to the color ""yellow"" (seen in the third example).
- ""bluf"" seems to be ""green"" (seen in the fourth and fifth examples).

Given these observations, we can determine that:

This correlation holds true regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence or the presence of other words around it. No other factors are shown to affect this relationship in the given examples.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,125,zup
"Based on the examples given, we can induce the following rules for the meanings of certain words:

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue

From the way bluf appears to influence the output, we notice that bluf doesn't have a fixed color associated with it. Instead, it results in the repeating of the colors that correspond to the words immediately following it. 

Let's observe how bluf interacts with the words following it in each example:

1. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
2. Input: zup bluf wif walm (walm doesn't have an assigned color, it seems to be irrelevant) -> Output: yellow yellow red red red
3. Input: zup bluf dax -> Output: yellow yellow green
4. Input: wif zup bluf -> Output: red yellow yellow (note that bluf comes after the word zup here, which has repeated)
5. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax -> Output: blue green green red green (note that wif comes after bluf, causing red to repeat)

Rule:
bluf -> Causes the color(s) represented by the word(s) immediately following it to be repeated once.

Example deductions showing the rule at work:

- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"" because wif means red and bluf repeats the following word's color once.
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" results in ""yellow yellow red red red"" because zup means yellow, wif means red. Bluf repeats the colors of the words that follow (yellow and red); walm has no assigned color but could potentially be ""ignored"" as it has no effect.
- ""zup bluf dax"" results in ""yellow yellow green"" because zup means yellow, dax means green, and bluf causes the repetition of the following word's color (green).
- ""wif zup bluf"" results in ""red yellow yellow"" because wif means red, zup means yellow and bluf repeats the color yellow once (notice that ""wif"" doesn't repeat because bluf isn't immediately after it).
- ""lug dax bluf wif dax"" results in ""blue green green red green"" because lug means blue, dax means green, and bluf repeats the following colors of wif and dax (red, green). 

Thus, the rule for bluf is that it repeats the color output associated with the immediately subsequent word(s). If there are two words following bluf, it will repeat the sequence of colors associated with both words. If there's only one word, it will repeat the color associated with that word once.",1.0,125,bluf
"bluf -> repeat previous color

Rule: The word ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated once.",1.0,125,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. 

To illustrate:

- In ""wif bluf"", ""wif"" yields ""red"", and then ""bluf"" repeats that color, yielding another ""red"".
- In ""zup bluf wif walm"", ""zup"" yields ""yellow"", ""bluf"" repeats that ""yellow"", and then ""wif"" yields ""red"", while ""walm"" has no precedent but follows the pattern where ""wif"" is followed by two ""red""s.
- In ""zup bluf dax"", ""zup"" yields ""yellow"", ""bluf"" repeats ""yellow"", and ""dax"" yields ""green"".
- In ""wif zup bluf"", ""wif"" yields ""red"", ""zup"" yields ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" repeats that ""yellow"".
- In ""lug dax bluf wif dax"", ""lug"" yields ""blue"", ""dax"" yields ""green"", ""bluf"" repeats ""green"", ""wif"" yields ""red"" and the next ""dax"" again yields ""green"".

bluf -> meaning. The rule underlying the meaning of ""bluf"" is that it repeats the color associated with the word that directly precedes it.",1.0,125,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can start by examining the relationship between the input and output pairs. It seems that each word in the input is translated to a specific color in the output, maintaining the same order. If we match each word in the input to the corresponding color in the output, we can deduce the following associations:

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue

Now, while ""bluf"" appears in every input example, its output color isn't immediately obvious, as the surrounding words all correspond directly to a specific color. Hence, it indicates that ""bluf"" is likely a nonce word that acts as a repeat function for the color word that immediately precedes it.

Validating with examples given:

- In the first input ""wif bluf"", ""wif"" corresponds to red, followed by another ""red"" for ""bluf"", which repeats the preceding color.
- In the second input ""zup bluf wif walm"" (though ""walm"" is not clearly translated, we can disregard it as it's not part of understanding ""bluf""), ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""bluf"" repeats this color, followed by ""wif"" translating to red. Since we don't have a color for ""walm"", we cannot be certain; however, it seems to be translated to red, matching ""wif"".
- For input ""zup bluf dax"", ""zup"" is yellow, ""bluf"" repeats the yellow, and ""dax"" is translated to green.
- In the fourth example, ""wif zup bluf"", ""wif"" is red, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""bluf"" repeats the preceding color, yellow.
- Finally, ""lug dax bluf wif dax"" translates to blue, green, followed by ""bluf"" repeating the previous color green, then ""wif"" as red, and lastly ""dax"" as green.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color of the word immediately before it.",1.0,125,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" represents a repetition of the output colors corresponding to the words that appear before it in the input. Looking at each example:

1. Input: wif bluf 
   Output: red red
   Here ""bluf"" is followed by ""red"", the color corresponding to ""wif"".

2. Input: zup bluf wif walm 
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow yellow"", the colors corresponding to ""zup"". The word ""walm"" does not seem to be affected by ""bluf""; instead, it repeats the last color mentioned, which in this case is ""red"".

3. Input: zup bluf dax 
   Output: yellow yellow green
   ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow yellow"", the colors corresponding to ""zup"".

4. Input: wif zup bluf 
   Output: red yellow yellow
   ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow"", the color corresponding to ""zup"".

5. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax 
   Output: blue green green red green
   ""bluf"" is followed by ""green green"", the colors corresponding to ""dax"".

From these observations, we can formulate the rule for ""bluf"" as follows:

bluf -> Repeat the sequence of colors corresponding to the words prior to bluf. 

Rule: ""Bluf"" repeats the output associated with all the words that come before it in the input sequence.",0.8,125,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's observe the relationship between the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

Input: zup walm wif

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

Looking at the examples, every time the word ""walm"" appears in the input, the output contains a repetition of a color three times. For example:

- ""zup walm"" consistently results in ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""dax walm"" consistently results in ""green green green""

The repeated color corresponds to the color mentioned before ""walm."" Therefore, ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the previously mentioned color, three times.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""walm"" means to repeat the color mentioned just before the word ""walm"" three times.",1.0,125,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we examine the input and corresponding output sequences.

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

In the outputs, every time ""walm"" appears, a sequence of three colors is produced: three yellows following ""zup walm"" and three greens following ""dax walm"". When ""wif"" or ""bluf"" are added after ""walm,"" additional reds and blues are produced, but the sequence of three identical colors persists and is consistent with the first word. It seems ""walm"" repeats the color indicated by the word immediately preceding it three times. Notice that ""lug"" also has a consistent color (blue), although it is not the focus here.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Thus, ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and ""dax"" with green. When ""wif"" or ""bluf"" follow ""walm,"" additional colors red or blue are produced in the sequence. ""walm"" operates independently of these additional words, maintaining the rule of repeating the preceding color three times.",1.0,125,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the color coded by the word that precedes it. The number of repetitions seems to be three times the color associated with the word before ""walm"". The color-coded words are ""zup"" for yellow and ""dax"" for green. There are no examples to indicate what happens if a word other than ""zup"" or ""dax"" precedes ""walm"". Further examples would be needed to elaborate the rule in those contexts.

Here is the deduced rule:

- When the word ""zup"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- When the word ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""green"" repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,125,walm
"Based on the given examples, ""walm"" seems to be associated with repeating the color correlated with the word immediately preceding it three times. 

For instance, in the first example, ""zup"" correlates with a single ""yellow,"" so ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" Similarly, ""dax"" correlates with a single ""green,"" so ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

"walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, the color associated with that preceding word is repeated three times.

- In both the third and fourth examples, ""lug"" appears on its own or followed by ""dax"" and results in ""blue"" with or without another color to follow.

The word that precedes ""bluf"" in each instance seems to determine its color translation:

- If ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", then ""bluf"" is translated to ""red"".
- If ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", then ""bluf"" is translated to ""green"".
- If there's no word before ""bluf"", as in the fourth example, we need more information to determine the rule, but based on the previous rules, it is likely that the absence of a preceding word defaults ""bluf"" to the color assigned to ""dax"" since ""dax"" was also in the input, making it ""green"".
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" follows ""bluf"" not precedes it, and the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue"". This might suggest that the following word can also affect the color, or there's another rule at play.

However, we need more information to come up with a definitive rule for all cases since we don't have a consistent positional rule. Moreover, we see that ""bluf"" translates differently when preceded by different words, but we do not have an example with ""lug"" and ""zup"" preceding ""bluf"" or ""bluf"" without any context.

2. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue blue blue"". Here, ""walm"" appears twice resulting in six 'green' outputs, ""zup"" is ""yellow"", and ""lug"" is ""blue"", which suggests that each ""walm"" results in ""green green green"".

3. ""wif dax lug walm"" leads to ""red green blue blue blue"", where ""wif"" is ""red"", ""dax"" is ""green"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", and again, ""walm"" appears to translate to ""blue blue blue"".

4. ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" gives ""blue green yellow green green green red"", where ""walm"" again corresponds to ""green green green"", and all other words lead to a single color output.

5. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"". Here, since we know ""dax"" is green and there are three greens in the output, it can be inferred that ""walm"" generates the other two greens.

Rule: walm -> three repetitions of the word ""green"".",0.9,126,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the repeating patterns and see how they correlate with changes in the output.

1. The first and last examples suggest that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" 
   - Input: ""dax lug walm"" → Output: ""green blue blue blue""
   - Input: ""dax walm"" → Output: ""green green green""

2. The presence of ""lug"" seems to correspond to the color ""blue,"" but we need to figure out how many times ""blue"" follows ""lug.""
   - It appears that ""lug"" is followed by multiple ""blue"" in the output, but the number isn't consistent across all examples.

3. ""walm"" seems to influence the number of times ""green"" occurs in the output, except in the first and last examples, where it follows ""dax.""
   - When ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output has additional ""green"" colors.
   - However, when ""walm"" is followed by another word (like ""zup"" or ""lug""), the pattern doesn't hold.

4. Looking at the second example, ""dax walm zup lug walm"" generates ""green green green yellow blue blue blue.""
   - If we take ""dax"" as ""green,"" ""zup"" as ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" as ""blue,"" then ""walm"" might repeat the previous color, but it does not explain the third ""green"" in the output.

5. The third example includes ""wif"" before ""dax lug walm,"" resulting in ""red green blue blue blue.""
   - This suggests that ""wif"" might correspond to ""red.""

To rectify the inconsistencies, let's consider the possibility that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that comes immediately before it, a specific number of times. We can test this hypothesis by examining ""dax lug walm"" where ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and should thus repeat ""blue"" multiple times. 

The number of repetitions might depend on the presence and position of ""dax"":
- When ""dax"" is immediately followed by ""walm,"" ""walm"" produces two additional ""green.""
- When ""walm"" comes after some other color word, ""walm"" repeats that color twice.

Let's consider if this applies to all examples:

1. ""dax lug walm"" → ""green blue blue blue"" (After ""lug,"" ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" two times.)
2. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" → ""green green green yellow blue blue blue"" (After ""dax,"" ""walm"" repeats ""green"" two times; after ""lug,"" ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" two times.)
3. ""wif dax lug walm"" → ""red green blue blue  blue"" (After ""lug,"" ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" two times.)
4. ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" → ""blue green yellow green green green red"" (After ""dax,"" ""walm"" repeats ""green"" two times.)
5. ""dax walm"" → ""green green green"" (After ""dax,"" ""walm"" repeats ""green"" two times.)

This rule seems to fit all the given examples. The number of repetitions generated by ""walm"" is two times the previous color mentioned (regardless of what that color is).

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word twice.",0.9,126,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can observe the following:

1. Whenever the nonce word ""walm"" is present, the output consists of multiple occurrences of ""blue.""
2. The amount of ""blue"" in the output seems to correspond to the position of ""walm"" in the input; the earlier ""walm"" appears, the more occurrences of ""blue"" in the output.

Let's analyze the occurrence of ""walm"" and the corresponding output:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue.""
- In the second example, ""lug walm"" still results in ""blue blue blue,"" and it seems ""walm"" by itself leads to ""green green,"" which precedes the ""blue blue blue.""
- In the third example, ""lug walm"" follows the same pattern with ""blue blue blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" and there is no ""lug"" before ""walm,"" but here, ""walm"" produces three greens instead of two as in the second example.
- In the fifth example, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" consistent with ""dax walm"" in the fourth example.

Combining the observed patterns, we can infer that ""walm"" induces a repetition of the color ""blue"" in the output, and the number of ""blue"" repeats is augmented by the presence of another word (possibly ""lug"") or by its own position in the sequence. However, following ""dax,"" it produces repetitions of ""green"" instead, suggesting that ""dax"" influences the behavior of ""walm.""

Rule: ""walm"" by itself -> repeat the color ""green"" for as many times as its position in the input list. If ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" then the color output is changed to ""blue.""
",0.8,126,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to directly influence the output by producing a sequence of ""green"" words. The number of times the word ""green"" appears in the output correlates with the position of ""walm"" within the input sequence. Specifically, it appears to add a ""green"" to the output for each word that precedes ""walm"" in the input sequence.

Here's how the rule applies to the examples:

1. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Rule Application: The word ""walm"" comes after two words (""dax"" and ""lug""), hence two ""green"" in the output before the other colors coded by ""lug"".

2. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   Rule Application: The first occurrence of ""walm"" comes after one word (""dax""), resulting in one ""green"". The second occurrence follows three words, adding three ""green"" to the output before the other colors coded by ""zup"" and ""lug"".

3. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   Rule Application: ""walm"" comes after three words (""wif"", ""dax"", ""lug""), resulting in three greens in the output before the sequence influenced by ""lug"".

4. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red
   Rule Application: ""walm"" follows four words (""lug"", ""dax"", ""zup"", ""dax""), adding four ""green"" to the output before the color influenced by ""wif"".

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Rule Application: ""walm"" follows one word (""dax""), therefore resulting in one ""green"" in the output.

From the above, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" adds a ""green"" to the output for each word that appears before it in the input sequence.

Rule: walm -> Add ""green"" to the output for each preceding word in the input sequence.",0.8,126,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the outputs in each example where the word ""walm"" is used. In every instance where ""walm"" is included, a sequence of ""blue blue blue"" follows it.

1. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Explanation: ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""walm"" is followed by ""blue blue blue"".

2. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   Explanation: ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""walm"" is followed by ""green green green"" which means ""walm"" itself results in ""green green"", ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" responds to blue, and ""walm"" again followed by ""blue blue blue"".

3. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   Explanation: ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""dax"" to green, ""lug"" to blue, and ""walm"" again followed by ""blue blue blue"".

4. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red
   Explanation: ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""dax"" to green, ""zup"" to yellow, there's another ""dax"" for green, then ""walm"" is followed by ""green green green"", and finally ""wif"" corresponds to red.

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Explanation: ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" is directly followed by two more greens, suggesting that ""walm"" itself also results in green.

Consistently, ""walm"" is followed by a triplet of the color that precedes it. Hence, we can deduce the likely rule that ""walm"" causes the duplication of the color word that appears directly before it, creating a triplet of that color.

Rule: walm -> repeat the preceding color word three times.",0.8,126,walm
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,127,lug

Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,127,lug
"Based on the provided examples and their associated outputs, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green."" Here is the reasoning:

Input: dax
Output: green
- Here, ""dax"" is the only word and the output is ""green.""

Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" while ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green.""

Input: lug dax
Output: blue green
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" comes out as ""green.""

Input: zup wif lug dax
Output: yellow red blue green
- Following the previous translations of ""zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""lug,"" ""dax"" remains consistent as ""green.""

Input: dax wif
Output: green red
- ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""wif"" is ""red.""

Given this consistent pattern in the examples, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" is:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,127,dax
"Based on the examples given, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, the output includes ""green"" in the corresponding position. There does not appear to be any context-dependent variation in the meaning of ""dax"" that would cause its translation to change based on other words present.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,127,dax
Rule: dax -> green,1.0,127,dax

"wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the examples provided.",1.0,127,wif

Output: red blue green green green

Input: zup wif

From these examples, we can see that whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.

There is a one-to-one correspondence between the appearance of ""wif"" and the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,127,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"":

Each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. Looking through the examples, we can see that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""walm"" to a repetition of ""green"" three times. ""Bluf"" corresponds to ""red"", but only when it does not appear immediately after ""wif"".

When ""wif"" appears, it translates to ""red"" in the output, and it also seems to affect the translation of the word that follows it if that word is ""bluf"", in which case ""bluf"" remains ""red"" instead of its usual translation.

Rule: wif -> ""red"" and the word ""bluf"" following ""wif"" also translates to ""red"" (instead of ""yellow"", which is its translation when it does not follow ""wif"").",1.0,127,wif
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the output. Here's how the deduction is made:

1. In the first example, ""lug zup dax wif"" translates to ""blue yellow green red"", with no context to infer the specific meaning of ""wif"".
2. In the second example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green"". Here, ""bluf"" appears to mean ""red"", and ""dax"" is consistently ""green"". The repeated ""green"" at the end suggests ""walm"" might indicate a repeated color.
3. In the third example, ""wif lug dax walm"" translates to ""red blue green green green"" which supports the previous deductions. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""dax"" to ""green"".
4. In the fourth example, ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red"" which directly provides the meaning of ""wif"" as ""red"".
5. Lastly, in the fifth example, ""zup bluf wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red"". This further reinforces that ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""bluf"" is ""red"", and consequently confirms that ""wif"" must also mean ""red"".

Putting it all together, we can deduce that:

Wif -> ""red""

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,127,zup

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow."" The word ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green."" The order of the words in the input seems to directly relate to the order of the colors in the output, which suggests that the system operates on a direct word-to-color mapping.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,127,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,127,zup
"To deduce the meaning or rule for ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns in the given examples where ""bluf"" is used and the corresponding output colors. Let's analyze the instances:

- Every instance of ""bluf"" in the input is paired with ""blue"" in the output.
- ""Bluf"" does not seem to be context-dependent since it translates consistently to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it.

Based on the examples provided:

Rule: bluf -> blue. Bluf consistently means blue regardless of the context within the given examples.",1.0,127,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine how it fits into each example and the corresponding outputs:

1. ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup"" maps to ""yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow.""
   - ""bluf dax"" is consistent in leading to ""green blue,"" and it follows ""zup"" which maps to ""yellow.""
   - ""lug bluf"" leads to ""blue blue,"" suggesting a repeated color output.

2. ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" maps to ""blue red red green blue blue.""
   - ""lug bluf"" once more leads to ""blue blue.""
  
3. ""wif bluf dax lug"" maps to ""red red green blue.""
   - ""wif bluf"" is matched with ""red red,"" hinting at a potential repetition.
  
4. ""wif zup dax bluf"" maps to ""red yellow green green.""
   - ""bluf"" as the last word shifts the previous color sequence by introducing another ""green,"" which suggests repeatability or duplication.

5. ""lug bluf"" maps to ""blue blue.""
   - Consistently, ""bluf"" after ""lug"" leads to the same color being output twice.

Based on these examples, ""bluf"" appears to create a repetition of the color output that precedes it. When ""bluf"" follows a word, the color corresponding to that word is outputted twice. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it results in the duplication of the immediately previous color in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> causes the previous color to be repeated.",1.0,127,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" translates directly to a color. In each instance where ""bluf"" is used, the corresponding output is ""blue"". Thus, ""bluf"" seems to signify the color ""blue"". 

Rule: bluf -> blue.",1.0,127,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to examine how it relates to the outputs and its role in each given input. Let's break it down by occurrence:

Input/Output Analysis:
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow
- lug bluf -> blue blue
- wif bluf -> red red
- dax bluf -> green green

In each example, ""bluf"" seems to precede a color repeatedly:
- ""bluf dax"" leads to ""green green,""
- ""bluf zup"" is not explicitly shown, but considering ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow,"" one might infer ""bluf zup"" would also result in a double yellow,
- ""bluf lug"" leads to ""blue blue,"" and so on.

Based on these, ""bluf"" seems to indicate the repetition of a color word that follows it. Therefore, when ""bluf"" is before a word representing a color, the output is that color word twice.

Rule:
bluf -> Repeats the color of the following word in the output.",1.0,127,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to a color, but its specific color appears to change depending on the context of other words around it. To deduce what ""bluf"" means, we should look for patterns in the examples.

Let’s examine each example and the output:

1. Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
   Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
   
2. Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
   Output: blue red red green blue blue
   
3. Input: wif bluf dax lug
   Output: red red green blue
   
4. Input: wif zup dax bluf
   Output: red yellow green green
   
5. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue

Observations:

- Whenever a color word is repeated with ""bluf"" in between (like ""lug bluf dax lug"" or ""wif bluf dax wif""), the output for ""bluf"" is the color that is repeated (blue or red), which could hint at ""bluf"" meaning ""repeat the next color"".
- In the first input, ""bluf"" appears twice and corresponds to ""blue"" both times. It is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""dax"", and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". This could indicate that ""bluf"" might be referring to the color that comes before it, which is further supported by input 5.

Based on these observations, a possible rule could be:

Rule: ""bluf"" means to repeat the color of the word that comes after it, unless it is at the end of a sequence, in which case it repeats the color of the word that comes before it.

Putting it into the requested format:

bluf -> repeat the next color's word, or if at the end, the previous color's word.",0.8,127,bluf
"Rule: ""walm"" means repeating the color designated by the previously mentioned word. 

For example: 
- In ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" thus ""walm"" corresponds to ""green green green,"" repeating the color associated with ""dax.""
- In ""zup walm wif,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""",0.8,127,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can look for patterns in the examples provided. It appears that each example containing ""walm"" has a corresponding output with repeated colors.

1. ""dax walm"" yields ""green green green"" – Here, ""walm"" is associated with a repetition of the color that precedes it (""dax"" = green).
2. ""zup walm wif"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow red"" – ""walm"" is again associated with a repetition of the color that precedes it (""zup"" = yellow), followed by another color (""wif"" = red).
3. ""wif walm dax zup"" yields ""red red red green yellow"" – ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" so the output is ""red"" repeated; the colors following ""walm"" then continue the sequence.
4. ""zup wif walm"" yields ""yellow red red red"" – ""walm"" follows ""wif"" again, so the color ""red"" is repeated.
5. ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" yields ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow"" – ""walm"" follows a ""zup,"" and the resulting output is ""yellow"" repeated.

Rule:
walm -> a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" in the sequence.",0.8,127,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the preceding color three times. Here is the reasoning:

In the first example, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"". Here, ""dax"" appears to correspond to ""green"", and ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""green"" three times.

In the second example, ""zup walm wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow red"". ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""walm"" causes the triple repetition of ""yellow"", and finally, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Continuing to analyze the other examples supports this rule, as ""walm"" consistently causes a triple repetition of the color word that precedes it.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the preceding color to be repeated three times in the output.",0.8,127,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the pattern of the colors in connection with the presence of ""walm"" in the inputs.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow

From these examples, we can observe the following patterns:

- When ""walm"" follows a word, the output repeats the color associated with that word (e.g., ""dax walm"" -> green green green, ""zup walm"" -> yellow yellow yellow).
- When ""walm"" is in the middle of a string of words, the color before ""walm"" is repeated as many times as the number of words following ""walm"" (e.g., ""wif walm dax zup"" -> red red red green yellow; there are three words after ""walm,"" so ""red"" is repeated three times).
- When ""walm"" is the last word, the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"" is repeated three times (e.g., ""zup wif walm"" -> yellow red red red).

Based on these observations, we can conclude that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately before it. The number of repetitions is either three or the number of words following ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> indicates a repetition of the color of the preceding word. The number of repetitions is three if ""walm"" is the last word or equals the number of words that follow ""walm"" in the sequence.",0.8,127,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" it is necessary to look at the patterns across the examples provided. 

Firstly, compare examples where we have isolated ""walm"" with other words:

- In the first example, ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green,"" indicating that ""walm"" may echo the color associated with the preceding word.

- In the second example, however, ""zup walm wif"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" implying that ""walm"" again echoes the color of the preceding word but does not impact the following word (""wif""), which has its own color.

- The third example can be slightly more confusing because ""walm"" is sandwiched between two words, but it outputs ""red red red green yellow,"" suggesting that ""walm"" echoes the color of the preceding word without impacting the following word's output.

This pattern breaks down with the fourth and fifth examples. The fourth example, ""zup wif walm,"" outputs ""yellow red red red,"" and the fifth, ""wif zup lug dax zup walm,"" produces ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow."" In both examples, the color red repeats more than once with the appearance of ""walm."" This repetition suggests that ""walm"" affects not just the color of the word immediately preceding it but may extend this effect to replicate the color a certain number of times.

Specifically, comparing the number of times ""walm"" causes replication in these examples may yield a pattern:

- In example 2, ""zup walm wif,"" ""zup"" is red, but because ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and it is followed by another word, ""wif,"" it seems to repeat the output of ""zup"" (yellow) until a new color prompt ""wif"" (red) appears.

- In example 4, ""zup wif walm,"" repetition occurs with the color red, where ""wif"" is immediately before ""walm.""

- In example 5, the occurrence of ""walm"" follows two instances of ""zup,"" suggesting that there may not be a strict limit on how many times it repeats the color of the previous word or words but that it can extend over multiple repetitions.

From this pattern, it begins to appear that ""walm"" causes the previous color word's output color to echo and repeat until a new color word appears. However, there is the possibility of an upper limit of repetition, suggested by example 5 where ""walm"" repeats the yellow from ""zup"" three times, but this is less certain.

Therefore the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in a sequence, it causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated in the output until a new color word is encountered or it has repeated a color a maximum of three times (although the upper limit is not confirmed with the examples given, as it could just be a coincidence that we never see more than three repetitions).

Hence, the induction would be:

"Based on the input-output pairs provided, ""wif"" appears to be associated with a sequence of color outputs, specifically ""red."" Every occurrence of ""wif"" in the input corresponds with ""red"" in the output. Additionally, the output ""red"" is repeated once more than the number of repetitions of ""wif."" Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and also requires repeating the color ""red"" one additional time beyond its own occurrence.

Rule:
wif -> the word ""wif"" in the input results in as many ""red"" in the output as there are wif plus one.",1.0,128,wif
"From observing the patterns in the inputs and outputs, it appears that each input word is associated with a color-coded output. Specifically, ""wif"" is consistently followed by ""red"" in the output, and each occurrence of ""wif"" yields a single ""red"" in the output sequence. Furthermore, the word ""walm"" that follows ""wif"" also translates to ""red,"" which can be confirmed by examples where ""walm"" appears without ""wif"" preceding it.

Based on the given examples:

- ""zup"" translates consistently to ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" translates consistently to ""blue"".
- ""wif"" translates consistently to ""red"".
- ""walm"" translates consistently to ""red"".

The presence of ""wif"" does not change the translation of the words that follow it; ""wif"" itself consistently results in ""red"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,128,wif
"Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color red. Each occurrence of ""wif"" results in the word ""red"" in the output.",1.0,128,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" appears to contribute to the output of the word ""red."" When ""wif"" is mentioned once, ""red"" is produced once in the output; when ""wif"" is mentioned twice, ""red"" is repeated twice in the subsequent positions within the sequence. It does not appear to be affected by its position in the input list, nor does it depend on the surrounding words since ""wif"" is consistent in contributing to the output of ""red"" regardless of context.

wif -> The word ""wif"" seems to translate to the color ""red"" in the output sequence. Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, add ""red"" to the output at the corresponding position.",1.0,128,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we need to look at each context it is used in and the corresponding output. Let's analyze it:

1. ""zup bluf wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red red red""
2. ""zup walm lug wif"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red""
3. ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red""
4. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" corresponds to ""blue red yellow red red red""
5. ""zup wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow red red red""

From these examples, we can observe that:
- ""walm"" always leads to red outputs, so it most likely corresponds to ""red.""
- ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow,"" since it always leads to a yellow output.
- ""lug"" appears once and corresponds to ""blue.""

Now, focusing on ""wif"":
- In example 1, it corresponds to two ""red"" outputs.
- In example 2, it follows ""lug"" and corresponds to a single ""red"" output.
- In example 3, it precedes ""walm"" with all ""red"" outputs.
- In examples 4 and 5, ""wif"" always corresponds to a ""red"" output before ""walm"" and after other words (""lug"" and ""zup"").

Given that ""wif"" appears directly before ""red"" outputs and considering that ""walm"" itself correlates with ""red,"" it seems that ""wif"" doesn't necessarily have a fixed color output on its own. Instead, it may be a modifier that, when combined with ""walm,"" creates repetition in the ""red"" output.

Therefore, the rule could be that ""wif"" before ""walm"" results in an extra ""red"" output for each instance. When used alone, the output for ""wif"" is ""red,"" likely because it implies a ""walm"" that isn't explicitly stated but is understood from context.

Rule: ""wif"" -> repeats the ""red"" output (associated with ""walm""), such that for each ""wif,"" there is one ""red"" in the output before the red(s) for ""walm."" If ""wif"" appears without ""walm,"" the output is one ""red,"" implying a missing ""walm.""",1.0,128,wif
"Based on the given examples, 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow.' Every instance of 'zup' in the input leads to 'yellow' in the output, regardless of its position or surrounding words.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,128,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can notice a consistent pattern where the nonce word ""zup"" is translated into a color. In each example where ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow."" Therefore, we can deduce that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,128,zup
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". This is demonstrated as follows:

- Whenever ""zup"" is present in the input, ""yellow"" is present in the corresponding output.
- ""Zup"" as a standalone input results in ""yellow"" as the output.
- The order of appearance of ""zup"" in the input matches the order of ""yellow"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule we deduce is:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,128,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can analyze the instances where ""zup"" appears and the corresponding output:

1. When “zup” appears alone, the output is just “yellow”.
2. Whenever “zup” appears in a sequence, it translates to “yellow”.

Given these observations, the meaning of ""zup"" seems to be consistently linked to a specific color in English:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,128,zup
Rule: zup -> yellow,1.0,128,zup
"From the provided examples, we can infer a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" by focusing on the output colors and their positions relative to the inputs:

1. Input: dax bluf wif lug
   Output: green green red blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""wif"" to red, and ""lug"" to blue.

2. Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
   Output: yellow yellow red blue green
   - Here, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" to red, ""lug"" to blue, and ""dax"" to green.

3. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow red green red red
   - ""zup"" is yellow, ""wif"" is red, and ""dax"" is green.

4. Input: lug bluf dax bluf
   Output: blue blue green green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""dax"" corresponds to green.

5. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""wif"" to red.

From these examples, when ""bluf"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is either red or green. It may not be immediately clear how to define ""bluf"" based on the first and last examples alone, but by examining the outputs related to ""bluf"" amongst all examples, we can note a pattern:

- The color red is only ever produced by the word ""wif"" or the word ""bluf.""
- The word ""bluf"" will output red if it is preceded by the word ""wif"" and green in all other cases.

Thus, we can deduce the rule for ""bluf"" as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to red when immediately following ""wif,"" and corresponds to green otherwise.

So we can express the meaning of ""bluf"" as:

bluf -> meaning: ""red"" if preceded by ""wif,"" otherwise ""green"".",1.0,128,bluf
"Reviewing the given examples and their corresponding outputs, we can identify a pattern for the nonce word ""bluf."" Here is the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""dax bluf wif lug"" translates to ""green green red blue,"" where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" Therefore, ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green.""

- In the second example, ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow red blue green."" Here, we see ""bluf"" coming right after ""zup,"" which results in another ""yellow"" in the output.

- In the third example, ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red green red red."" The only instance where ""bluf"" does not result in the word ""green"" is when it follows ""wif,"" leading to ""red.""

- In the fourth example, ""lug bluf dax bluf"" translates to ""blue blue green green."" ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" ""Bluf"" here produces ""green"" when not following ""wif.""

- Finally, in the fifth example, ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red."" Again, ""bluf"" yields ""red"" following ""wif.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" unless it immediately follows the word ""wif,"" in which case it translates to ""red.""

Therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" can be encapsulated by the rule:

bluf -> When following ""wif,"" translates to ""red."" In all other contexts, translates to ""green.""",1.0,128,bluf
"Analyzing the given examples, one can see that each instance of a nonce word has a corresponding color in the output. We look for a pattern to deduce the meaning or the rule behind the word ""bluf."" Here is what each input word corresponds to in the outputs:

1. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
2. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
3. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
4. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Now, by looking at each example:

1. In the first input, ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""blue."" However, since ""lug"" also corresponds to ""blue,"" this does not provide a distinctive meaning for ""bluf.""

2. In the second input, ""bluf"" again corresponds to ""red"" in the output, but since ""wif"" already corresponds to ""red,"" this is also not distinct.

3. In the third input, ""bluf"" corresponds to the last ""red"" in the output.

4. In the fourth input, ""bluf"" correlates with ""green"" in the output, but so does ""dax,"" therefore this is not uniquely linked to ""bluf.""

5. In the fifth input, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second and last ""red"" in the output.

By examining the patterns, it becomes apparent that ""bluf"" does not consistently correspond to a single color across the examples. Instead, it seems to repeat the color output of the immediate previous word (except in the cases where ""bluf"" is the first word, which we do not have examples of). So whenever ""bluf"" appears after another nonce word, the output color is repeated.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it duplicates the color output of the word that precedes it:

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.",0.8,128,bluf
"From the examples provided, we can see a pattern of word to color mapping, with each unique word being assigned a specific color. The challenge is to ascertain what ""bluf"" represents in the context of colors. Here's the analysis:

1. In the first example, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red.
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" also corresponds to the color red.
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red again.
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows the pattern and corresponds to green, which conflicts with the previous examples.
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to red, consistent with the first three examples.

It seems there is an inconsistency in example four that needs to be explained. One possible explanation is that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red, but in this instance, another rule might be affecting the output, such as the repetition of the word ""bluf"" causing a change in the color output from red to green. However, without more examples or information, we cannot determine if any such secondary rules exist.

Based on the consistency in four out of five examples, the most straightforward conclusion is:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> red",0.8,128,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, bluf corresponds to the color red. Each time the word bluf appears in the input, the word red appears in the same position in the output.

Therefore, the rule is: bluf -> red.",0.0,128,bluf
"walm -> rule. Rule: The word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, repeated three times. For example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green"" being repeated three times because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" while ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow"" being repeated three times because ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""",1.0,128,walm
"walm -> repeat the color of the previous word three times.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" appears in a sequence, the output is three times the color corresponding to the word that appears just before ""walm."" For instance, ""dax"" corresponds to green, so ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green."" Similarly, ""lug"" correlates with blue, making ""lug walm"" turn into ""blue blue blue."" The pattern persists irrespective of the word that comes before ""walm"".",1.0,128,walm
"From the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" results in a repetition of three or four colors in the output, depending on the context:

1. dax (green) wif (red) walm -> green red red red
2. lug (blue) dax (green) walm -> blue green green green
3. dax (green) walm -> green green green
4. zup (yellow) walm -> yellow yellow yellow
5. dax (green) lug (blue) walm -> green blue blue blue

The pattern suggests that ""walm"" causes the last mentioned color to be repeated three more times. If there are two colors mentioned before ""walm,"" the last color is repeated three times, following the first mentioned color. If one color is mentioned, just that color is repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the last color mentioned in the input three additional times. If two colors are mentioned before walm, the second color is repeated three times following the first color. If only one color is mentioned, it is repeated three times.",1.0,128,walm
"After examining the examples provided, we can infer a pattern that associates the nonce word ""walm"" with the repetition of a color. The color repeated seems to depend on the word coming before ""walm."" Here are the apparent associations:

- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow
  
When ""walm"" follows any of these words, the output is the color associated with the preceding word, repeated multiple times. Specifically, the number of color repetitions seems to depend on the number of words in the input sequence before ""walm""—one for ""dax"" or ""zup,"" and one additional for each other word.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the last word before ""walm"" in the sequence, multiple times. The number of repetitions is equal to the number of words before ""walm,"" with each word contributing one repetition.

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the associated color, with the number of repetitions equal to the word count before ""walm"".",1.0,128,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to signify repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. Specifically, each instance of ""walm"" is followed by repetitions of a color adjective that corresponds to the preceding word.

Analyzing the examples:

1. ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" and when ""walm"" follows it, ""green"" is repeated three times.
2. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and with ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times.
3. When ""walm"" immediately follows ""dax,"" the ""green"" is repeated two times, suggesting that ""walm"" may require a prior word to determine the number of repetitions.
4. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and with ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
5. When ""walm"" follows both ""dax"" and ""lug,"" ""green"" is stated once, and then ""blue"" is repeated three times, indicating that ""walm"" might cause repetition of the color corresponding to the last word before it.

Taking this into account, ""walm"" appears to cause the preceding color word to be repeated three times. If ""walm"" follows two color-associated words, then the color associated with the last word is repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the last color word before it three times. If ""walm"" is the only word after a color word, then the color word is repeated two more times. If it follows two color words, the last one is repeated three more times, and the first color is mentioned once.",1.0,128,walm

Other words appear to correspond with other colors: ""dax"" with green, ""bluf"" with yellow, and ""wif"" with red.

Therefore, the rule that can be deduced for ""zup"" is:

"Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds with the color ""yellow.""",1.0,129,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can observe that the presence of the nonce word ""bluf"" determines a specific color in the output. Here is what we see for each example:

4. ""bluf"" following ""zup"" results in two yellows: ""green yellow yellow.""
5. ""bluf"" between ""zup"" and ""lug"" gives two yellows followed by a blue: ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow.""

Taking these observations into account, it appears that the word ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow."" To confirm this, we can check whether replacing ""bluf"" with ""yellow"" in the input gives us a direct match to the sequence of colors in the output:

- Input ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" would become ""yellow yellow wif green wif yellow,"" which matches the output ""yellow yellow red green red yellow,"" considering that ""wif"" is red (as it's the remaining color not represented in the output when ""bluf"" is turned into ""yellow"").

- Example 2: Input ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" output: ""yellow blue red green green red"". Here, ""bluf"" appears after ""dax"" and is translated to ""green"". It seems to assume the color of the word before it, which in this case is ""dax"" representing ""green"".

- Example 3: Input ""zup bluf lug dax lug"" output: ""yellow yellow blue green blue"". ""Bluf"" again follows ""zup"" and is translated to ""yellow"". Like previously, it seems to adopt the color associated with the preceding word.

- Example 4: Input ""dax zup bluf"" output: ""green yellow yellow"". ""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" and translates to ""yellow"".

- Example 5: Input ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" output: ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"". ""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" and takes on the color ""yellow,"" but when it precedes ""lug"", it's translated to ""blue"", following the pattern where it takes the color of the word that comes after it.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes on the color of the preceding word (if there is one); if ""bluf"" precedes another color word, it adopts that color instead. In case there is no word before ""bluf"", we would need more examples to deduce what the default color may be, if any.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the closest adjacent color word. If it follows a color word, it assumes that color; if it precedes one, it takes the color of the word after it.

5. zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue

Here's what we can gather from these examples:

- Whenever ""dax"" is present, the output begins with green repeated three times.
- Whenever ""lug"" is present, the output begins with blue repeated twice.
- Whenever ""zup"" is present, but not immediately following ""walm,"" ""yellow"" appears after the colors that correspond to ""dax"" or ""lug.""
- In the presence of ""walm,"" the color before it repeats one or more times for each instance of ""walm.""

Therefore, it suggests that ""walm"" means to repeat the previous color. Let's verify this with each example:

1. ""dax walm"" (green repeated 3 times) confirms the rule.
2. ""lug walm"" (blue repeated 3 times) confirms the rule.
3. ""lug walm zup walm"" (blue repeated 3 times, yellow, then yellow repeated twice) confirms the rule as ""walm"" occurs twice and the pattern follows accordingly.
4. ""dax walm"" (as before, green repeated 3 times) confirms the rule.
5. ""zup lug walm"" (yellow, then blue twice, then blue one more time) also confirms the rule as the color blue is repeated thanks to ""walm.""

Rule:
walm -> meaning: Repeat the previous color output.",0.9,129,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" we need to analyze the pattern of inputs and their corresponding outputs. Since the examples each include the nonce word ""walm"" followed by a series of color words in the output, it seems that ""walm"" causes repetition of the previous color word associated with the preceding nonce word. Here's a look at each input and output set:

- ""dax walm wif zup"" leads to ""green green green red yellow"". Here, ""dax"" is associated with ""green"", and after ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated twice more before moving on to the next associated color.
- ""dax lug walm"" yields ""green blue blue blue"". ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" and ""lug"" with ""blue"". After ""walm"", the color ""blue"" is repeated three times in total.
- ""lug walm zup walm"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow"". ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"", which is repeated three times after ""walm""; then ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"", which is also repeated three times after the second occurrence of ""walm"".
- ""dax walm"" gives us ""green green green"". Again, ""dax"" correlates with ""green"", and it is repeated two additional times after ""walm"".
- ""zup lug walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue"". ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"" and ""lug"" with ""blue"". After ""walm"", we get ""blue"" three times.

Based on the above observations, ""walm"" intersects the preceding nonce word's associated color to be repeated two additional times. Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous nonce word three times in total.",0.9,129,walm
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,130,lug
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following patterns:

1. ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"".
2. ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"".
3. ""walm"" is followed by four repetitions of ""red"".
4. ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".

The word ""lug"" seems to consistently translate to ""blue"", appearing both at the beginning and in the middle of the sequences, and always resulting in the word ""blue"" in the output. However, in examples where ""lug"" is followed by other words like ""wif"", ""walm"", ""dax"", or ""zup"", it doesn't seem to affect the translation of those other words. 

So the possible rule for the nonce word ""lug"" can be:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,130,lug
"Based on the examples provided, lug consistently translates to the color blue. Each time the word 'lug' is mentioned, the output always includes the color blue, irrespective of its position in the input string or the surrounding words.

"Given the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" To confirm this, I will look at each example and verify the correspondence.

- In the first example, ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue."" Here, ""lug"" could represent ""blue"" as it's the second color mentioned.
  
- In the second example, ""lug wif walm"" results in ""blue red red red."" It is consistent with the rule that ""lug"" is ""blue,"" as ""lug"" is the first word and ""blue"" is the first color mentioned. ""wif"" may then correspond to ""red,"" and ""walm"" might mean repeating the color mentioned before it.

- In the third example, ""lug dax"" translates to ""blue green,"" which supports that ""lug"" is ""blue,"" as it appears first and is followed by ""green,"" possibly represented by ""dax.""

- The fourth example, ""lug zup lug"" results in ""blue yellow blue."" This supports that ""lug"" is ""blue"" since it appears on both sides of ""yellow,"" which may be represented by ""zup.""

- In the final example, ""dax lug wif"" results in ""green blue red."" This again is consistent with ""lug"" being ""blue"" as it appears in the middle of the sequence, similar to its position in the output.

- In the first example, ""zup bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow red,"" where ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the color associated with ""wif"" (red).
- Similarly, in the second example, ""wif bluf lug zup"" turns into ""red red blue yellow,"" where ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""lug"" (blue).
- The pattern holds in all other examples provided where the occurrence of ""bluf"" always repeats the color associated with the word following it.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the following word.",1.0,130,bluf
Rule: bluf means to repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before it.,1.0,130,bluf
"From the given examples, we can infer the following pattern: the output color that follows the word ""bluf"" is always the same as the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"". Let's analyze the pattern:

In the first example:
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow"" (the same color that represents ""zup"")
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

In the second example:
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""bluf"" is followed by ""red"" (the same color that represents ""wif"")
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

In the third example:
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" is followed by ""green"" (the same color that represents ""dax"")
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

In the fourth example:
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow"" (the same color that represents ""zup"")
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

In the fifth example:
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" is followed by ""green"" (the same color that represents ""dax"")
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- The second ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow"" once more (the same color that represents ""zup"")
- The last ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" (consistent with the ""dax"" representation)

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" is that it signifies a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that comes just before it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word that precedes ""bluf"".",1.0,130,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we must find a pattern in the examples provided:

1. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   
2. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue
   
3. Input: lug walm zup
   Output: blue blue blue yellow
   
4. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   
5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

From the outputs associated with the inputs that contain ""walm,"" a pattern emerges. Each time ""walm"" is mentioned, multiple instances of the color that precedes it are repeated. Paying close attention, it seems that ""walm"" doubles the occurrence of the color word that precedes it. For example:

- In the first example, ""wif"" is associated with the color red, and after ""walm,"" we have ""red red red"" instead of just ""red.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" is associated with the color blue, and after ""walm,"" we have two extra occurrences of ""blue,"" tallying to four instances of ""blue.""
- In the third example, the color blue (associated with ""lug"") is repeated thrice after ""walm.""
- In the fourth example, again, the color blue (associated with ""lug"") is repeated thrice after ""walm.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" is the word right before ""walm"" and is associated with the color blue. After ""walm,"" there are three instances of ""blue"" indicating that the appearance of ""lug"" is doubled.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:
Rule: walm -> repeats the preceding color word twice, effectively tripling that color's occurrence.

Based on this rule, ""walm"" can be seen as a nonce word that means to triple the immediate preceding color in the sequence.",1.0,130,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we notice that the word ""walm"" translates to repetitions of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. Here is the breakdown:

- ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red""—""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and ""walm"" results in two additional repetitions of ""red.""
- ""dax lug dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue green blue blue blue""—""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and ""walm"" leads to two extra occurrences of ""blue.""
- ""lug walm zup"" gives ""blue blue blue yellow""—""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" duplicates ""blue"" two times before moving onto ""zup,"" which is associated with ""yellow.""
- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue""—again, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" doubles the ""blue.""
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" translates to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue""—""lug"" is ""blue,"" and so ""walm"" follows with two more ""blue"" before continuing to ""dax"" and ""lug,"" which are ""green"" and ""blue,"" respectively.

Hence, the rule is that ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the color associated with the previously mentioned color word, specifically adding two more instances of that color.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word two more times.",1.0,130,walm
"Based on the provided examples, ""walm"" seems to be associated with a repetitive pattern of the color blue. More specifically, ""walm"" seems to output a series of blue repetitions that equal the number of previous words plus one. To validate this hypothesis, let's examine the inputs and outputs more closely:

- ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red"" which means one word before ""walm"" leads to two repetitions of blue, plus one.
- ""dax lug dax lug walm"" outputs ""green blue green blue blue blue"" which means four words before ""walm"" lead to five repetitions of blue.
- ""lug walm zup"" produces ""blue blue blue yellow"" indicating that ""walm"" comes with three preceding words, hence three repetitions of blue plus one.
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" correctly fitting the pattern of two blues for the one word before ""walm,"" plus one.
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" outputs ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue,"" revealing that there are four colors before ""walm,"" thereby corresponding to five blues after the word ""lug.""

Considering these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" translates to a number of consecutive ""blue"" words equal to the count of the preceding words plus one.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the word ""blue"" a number of times equal to the number of words that come before ""walm"" in the sequence, plus one.",1.0,130,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns before and after the word in the given inputs and outputs.

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

It seems that ""wif"" is translated to ""red"" and following ""walm"" we still have ""red."" However, this is not sufficient information to deduce what ""walm"" means because it is only followed by a repetition of the color that directly precedes it.

Input: dax lug dax lug walm
Output: green blue green blue blue blue

In this example, ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" After ""walm,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated twice, suggesting that ""walm"" might be causing a repetition of the color that came just before it.

Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow

Here, ""lug"" is again translated to ""blue,"" followed by two additional ""blue"" after ""walm,"" before ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" This example reinforces the idea that ""walm"" causes the color before it to repeat.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

Once more ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and is followed by ""walm,"" which creates two more occurrences of ""blue.""

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

Here we have several more colors to consider, but after ""walm"" we again see a repetition, this time of ""blue,"" which was the color directly preceding ""walm.""

Rule:
Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" is a rule that causes the color word directly preceding it to be repeated twice more in the output.

So:

walm -> Causes the prior color to be repeated two more times.",0.9,130,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word 'walm' seems to generate a series of the word 'blue' in the output. Specifically, it appears that the quantity of 'blue' it generates depends on the preceding words. To derive the underlying rule, let's analyze the number of times 'blue' appears after 'walm':

1. 'wif walm' -> 'red red red' (no 'blue' after 'walm' since it doesn't appear, but let's keep this for reference)
2. 'dax lug dax lug walm' -> 'green blue green blue blue blue'
3. 'lug walm zup' -> 'blue blue blue yellow'
4. 'lug walm' -> 'blue blue blue'
5. 'wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug' -> 'red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue'

Looking at examples 2, 3, and 4, here's what aligns:
- In example 2, 'walm' is followed by four 'blue', preceded by 'dax lug dax lug'.
- In example 3, 'walm' is followed by three 'blue', preceded by 'lug'.
- In example 4, 'walm' is also followed by three 'blue', and it's also only preceded by 'lug'.

We can guess that 'lug' before 'walm' causes a repeat of 'blue' three times. To confirm, we might compare example 5, which has 'lug' before 'walm' and is also followed by three 'blue'. 

However, when considering 'dax lug dax lug walm', 'walm' generates four 'blue'. If every 'lug' before 'walm' results in three 'blue' and 'dax' turns to green, the fourth 'blue' seems to indicate that an additional 'lug' also contributes to another 'blue'. Therefore, the rule might involve not only the immediate preceding word but could also consider a pattern preceding 'walm'.

Now let's form the rule considering all the examples:

- For every 'lug' immediately before 'walm', there are three 'blue'. (examples 3, 4, and 5 confirm this)
- 'dax lug' immediately before 'walm' seems to add an extra 'blue', making it four 'blue' in total. (only example 2 confirms this)

So the rule could be:

- 'walm' outputs three 'blue' if preceded by 'lug'.
- An extra 'blue' is added for every 'lug' present in the combination of two words preceding 'walm', perhaps specifically the pattern 'dax lug'.

Therefore, 'walm' seems to be a command for producing 'blue' based on its preceding context, primarily influenced by the presence of the word 'lug'.

Rule: The word 'walm' produces a series of 'blue' in the output, with the number being dependent on the preceding words, especially 'lug' and 'dax lug'.",0.8,130,walm

3. wif dax zup dax -> red green yellow green
4. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow

A pattern emerges where each instance of ""bluf"" in the input results in a duplication of the color that precedes it in the output:

""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red.""
""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and when ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output includes a duplicate ""yellow.""

1. wif bluf -> red red
2. zup bluf -> yellow yellow

4. zup bluf dax lug -> yellow yellow green blue

In the third example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" again. Similarly, in the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the output is ""yellow"" once more.

Thus, based on these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately before it.

"Rule: bluf -> repeater. The word ""bluf"" in the examples repeats the color word that precedes it. If there is no color word before ""bluf,"" then it does not output a color.",0.8,131,bluf
"Rule: ""walm"" refers to repeating the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times. 

In the examples given:
- ""zup wif walm"" yields ""yellow red red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- ""lug walm wif lug"" leads to ""blue blue blue red blue"" since ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug"" (blue) three times, followed by the color corresponding to ""wif"" (red), and then the color for ""lug"" again (blue).
- ""dax walm"" produces ""green green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- Finally, ""lug walm zup walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow"" because ""walm"" repeats the color for ""lug"" (blue) and then repeats the color for ""zup"" (yellow).

Therefore:

walm -> Repeat the color of the word immediately before ""walm"" three times.",1.0,131,walm
"Based on the examples, it seems that ""walm"" affects the color output without introducing a new color by itself, but rather by repeating the color associated with the previous word a number of times. The number of repetitions and the particular color repeated depend on the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

- In the first example, the word ""wif"" appears to correspond to the color red. When followed by ""walm,"" it results in ""red red red,"" which could indicate that ""walm"" makes the last color appear three times.
- In the second example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and seems to be associated with blue, with ""walm"" causing the color to appear three times as well.
- The third example reiterates the behavior, with a sequence of ""lug walm"" resulting in ""blue blue blue,"" and then adding ""wif lug"" results in an additional ""red blue,"" showing that ""lug"" still corresponds to a single blue when not followed directly by ""walm.""
- ""Dax"" seems to be green, and when followed by ""walm,"" it gives us ""green green green,"" just like the previous patterns.
- Lastly, ""lug walm zup walm"" provides us with ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""lug walm"" and ""zup walm"" each respectively result in three blue and three yellow repetitions.

- ""lug walm"" yields ""blue blue blue."" We could infer that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" results in repetition of the color thrice.
- ""lug walm wif lug"" results in ""blue blue blue red blue."" ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" and by the previous deduction, we saw ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" Since ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it is again associated with repeating ""blue"" three times.
- ""dax walm"" yields ""green green green."" As with ""lug,"" we can infer ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" is again linked to tripling the first color.
- ""lug walm zup walm"" yields ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow."" Breaking it down: ""lug walm"" seems to correspond to ""blue blue blue,"" and ""zup walm"" appears to correspond to ""yellow yellow yellow."" 

This observation suggests the rule for ""walm"" is consistent across different contexts. It seems to cause the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times.",1.0,131,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" indicates repetition of a color associated with the word that comes before it. Each instance of ""walm"" causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times. 

Here are how the examples break down:
- ""zup wif walm"": ""zup"" becomes yellow, ""wif"" becomes red, and ""walm"" causes red to be repeated three times.
- ""lug walm"": ""lug"" becomes blue, and ""walm"" causes blue to be repeated three times.
- ""lug walm wif lug"": ""lug"" becomes blue, and ""walm"" causes blue to be repeated three times, ""wif"" becomes red, and the second ""lug"" becomes blue again.
- ""dax walm"": ""dax"" becomes green, and ""walm"" causes green to be repeated three times.
- ""lug walm zup walm"": ""lug"" becomes blue, and ""walm"" causes blue to be repeated three times, ""zup"" becomes yellow, and the second ""walm"" causes yellow to be repeated three times.

"In order to induce the rule for the word ""dax,"" let's look at the position of ""dax"" in each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   (""dax"" is followed by ""green"")

2. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red
   (""dax"" is followed by ""green"")

3. Input: lug dax walm wif
   Output: blue green green green red
   (""dax"" is followed by ""green"")

4. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   (""dax"" is followed by ""green"")

5. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   (""dax"" is followed by ""green"")

Looking at the outputs corresponding to each input where ""dax"" is mentioned, the word ""dax"" is consistently followed by the color ""green"" in the outputs. Now we should also check if any other pattern applies to other parts of the inputs or if there's any counter-example where ""dax"" doesn't lead to ""green"", but there are none. Every occurrence of ""dax"" corresponds directly to ""green"" in the output sequence.

Therefore, the rule we can induce for ""dax"" is:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,132,dax
"To deduce the meaning or rule for ""dax"" from the examples given, let's look at each example, the position of ""dax,"" and the corresponding output:

- In the first input, ""dax"" is followed by ""wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""walm,"" and the output sequence starts with ""green,"" followed by ""red,"" ""yellow,"" and a series of ""red"" outputs. The presence of ""dax"" coincides with ""green"" starting the sequence.

- In the second input, ""dax"" is immediately followed by ""wif,"" and the output is ""green red."" It suggests that ""dax"" translates directly to ""green,"" with ""wif"" mapping to ""red.""

- In the third input, ""dax"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""walm,"" and ""wif,"" with the output being ""blue,"" ""green,"" ""green,"" ""green,"" ""red."" Here, ""dax"" also corresponds to ""green.""

- The fourth input places ""dax"" after ""lug"" and before ""zup"" and ""walm,"" with the output sequence containing ""green"" at the position after ""blue,"" which is the color associated with ""lug.""

- In the fifth input, ""dax"" is located between ""bluf"" and ""walm,"" with ""green"" appearing in the output following the ""red"" that corresponds to ""wif.""

Considering all these examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" directly correlates with the output color ""green,"" regardless of its position or the surrounding words. The word ""dax"" is consistently mapped to ""green"" in the output sequence. Hence, the rule for ""dax"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,132,dax
"To determine the meaning or rule for ""dax,"" let's look at the outputs after each occurrence of the word:

- In the first example, ""dax"" is followed by four other words, and the corresponding output starts with ""green"" followed by three reds and a yellow. Since ""wif"" corresponds to red in all the examples, the presence of ""walm"" at the end correlates with the shift in pattern (yellow).

- In the second example, ""dax wif"" translates to ""green red."" Here, ""wif"" stands for red consistently, and ""dax"" for green (confirmed by the previous example).

- In the third example, ""lug dax walm wif"" translates to ""blue green green green red."" The ""lug"" correlates to blue, ""dax"" to green, ""walm"" is contextually green, and ""wif"" ends with red.

- In the fourth example, ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" becomes ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow,"" which shows that after ""lug"" (blue), ""dax"" is followed by ""green,"" and then ""zup"" and ""walm"" string together yellows.

- In the last example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" corresponds to ""red red green green green."" ""Bluf"" corresponds to red, and ""dax"" is followed by green, and ""walm"" which follows ""dax"" also correlates with green.

Given the consistencies in pattern, ""dax"" consistently correlates with the color ""green,"" regardless of the context it's in. Thus, the meaning of ""dax"" seems to be the color green.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,132,dax
"To deduce the meaning or the rule for the nonce word ""dax,"" we analyze the outputs in relation to their inputs, paying attention to where ""dax"" appears:

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
Analysis: ""dax"" precedes ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" ""wif,"" and ""walm."" ""Green"" is followed by a series of colors that correlate with other words, except for ""dax.""

Input: dax wif
Output: green red
Analysis: ""dax"" directly precedes ""wif,"" and the corresponding output is ""green"" followed by ""red.""

Input: lug dax walm wif
Output: blue green green green red
Analysis: ""dax"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and precedes ""walm"" (green) and ""wif"" (red). Since ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and both yield ""green,"" but only when ""dax"" is present does it repeat.

Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
Analysis: When ""dax"" appears after ""lug"" (blue), it is followed by ""green,"" but when ""zup"" and ""walm"" follow ""dax,"" they yield ""yellow.""

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
Analysis: ""dax"" is preceded by ""bluf"" (red) and followed by ""walm,"" which yields repeated ""green.""

Based on these analyses, ""dax"" seems to not have a corresponding color but rather a rule that it enforces upon the subsequent word(s). The rule appears to involve repetition:
1. When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated.
2. When ""dax"" is followed by ""wif,"" the next color (red) appears but is not repeated.
3. ""dax"" seems to cause a repeat of the color corresponding to the word that follows it unless that word is ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" might be that it causes the color of the following word to repeat, except when the following word is ""wif,"" in which case ""red"" does not repeat.

Rule: dax -> causes the next word's color to repeat, except when the next word is 'wif'.",0.8,132,dax
"Rule: ""dax"" translates to a sequence of ""green green green"".

Explanation: Whenever ""dax"" is present, it is followed by ""green green green"" in the output.

Let's verify this with the given examples:

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
- Here, the ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" and the subsequent colors match the pattern after other words.

Input: dax wif
Output: green red
- Again, ""dax"" is followed immediately by ""green"".

Input: lug dax walm wif
Output: blue green green green red
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", followed by ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green green green"", and then ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
- The sequence after ""dax"" includes ""green"" followed by the pattern for subsequent words (""zup"" and ""walm"" both correspond to ""yellow"").

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
- ""dax"" appears after ""wif"" and ""bluf"" and is followed by a ""green green green"" sequence.

Therefore, the rule is:
Rule: ""dax"" -> green green green",0.0,132,dax
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""

Here are the examples with the translation applied:

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow
Explanation: The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red
Explanation: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds again to ""red.""

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow
Explanation: This is the same as the first example and follows the same translation.

Input: dax bluf wif lug
Output: green green red blue
Explanation: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" again (as it did in the second example), ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red
Explanation: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Thus, the meaning can be deduced as follows:

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the outputs provided. Each occurrence of ""zup"" is directly translated to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,132,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can look at the position of the word and the corresponding color output. Each example seems to pair the word before ""bluf"" with the color before ""red"" in the output. Here is what we can deduce:

1. ""dax bluf wif zup"" -> ""green green red yellow""
   - The word ""bluf"" follows ""dax""; ""green"" is in the position after the first ""green.""

2. ""lug bluf wif"" -> ""blue blue red""
   - The word ""bluf"" follows ""lug""; ""blue"" is in the position after the first ""blue.""

3. ""dax wif bluf"" -> ""green red red""
   - The word ""bluf"" follows ""wif""; ""red"" is in the position after ""green.""

4. ""zup bluf dax"" -> ""yellow yellow green""
   - The word ""bluf"" follows ""zup""; ""yellow"" is in the position after the first ""yellow.""

5. ""wif bluf zup"" -> ""red red yellow""
   - The word ""bluf"" follows ""wif""; ""red"" is in the position after the first ""red.""

Based on these examples, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" results in a repetition of the color corresponding to the word preceding it. If we were to assign a color directly to ""bluf,"" it wouldn't be consistent across the examples. Instead, ""bluf"" functions like a ""repeat"" command for the color code associated with the word before it.

Rule: *bluf* -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word.",1.0,132,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word. 

So in each case, the color corresponding to the word right before ""bluf"" is repeated:
- ""dax bluf wif zup"" -> ""green green red yellow"" (""dax"" is green, so ""bluf"" means repeat green)
- ""lug bluf wif"" -> ""blue blue red"" (""lug"" is blue, so ""bluf"" means repeat blue)
- ""dax wif bluf"" -> ""green red red"" (""wif"" is red, so ""bluf"" means repeat red)
- ""zup bluf dax"" -> ""yellow yellow green"" (""zup"" is yellow, so ""bluf"" means repeat yellow)
- ""wif bluf zup"" -> ""red red yellow"" (""wif"" is red, so ""bluf"" means repeat red)",1.0,132,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it. Here's the breakdown:

- In ""dax bluf wif zup"", ""dax"" leads to ""green"", and then ""bluf"" also leads to ""green"".
- In ""lug bluf wif"", ""lug"" leads to ""blue"", and ""bluf"" leads to ""blue"" as well.
- In ""dax wif bluf"", ""wif"" leads to ""red"", and then ""bluf"" leads to ""red"", following ""wif"".
- In ""zup bluf dax"", ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" also leads to ""yellow"".
- In ""wif bluf zup"", ""wif"" leads to ""red"", and ""bluf"" follows with ""red"".

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be repeating the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> copies the color of the preceding word.",1.0,132,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word that follows it. If no word follows ""bluf"", then ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes it. 

Examples with rule applied:

- dax bluf wif zup => dax is green, bluf takes color of wif which is red, wif is red, zup is yellow.
- lug bluf wif => lug is blue, bluf takes color of wif which is red, wif is red.
- dax wif bluf => dax is green, wif is red, bluf takes color of wif which is red.
- zup bluf dax => zup is yellow, bluf takes color of dax which is green, dax is green.
- wif bluf zup => wif is red, bluf takes color of zup which is yellow, zup is yellow.

Hence, bluf -> takes the color of the following word, or the preceding if none follows.",1.0,132,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look at its position in the sentences as well as its correspondence with the colors in the output. Let's examine the pattern based on the position of ""bluf"" and the words associated with it:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the colors are ""green green.""
- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the colors are ""blue blue.""
- When ""bluf"" precedes ""wif,"" the output color is ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" precedes ""dax"" or ""zup,"" the output colors are ""yellow green"" and ""red yellow"" respectively, matching the colors associated with ""dax"" and ""zup"" when they stand alone or follow other words.

From these observations, we can generate a rule about the meaning of ""bluf"":

Rule:
""Bluf"" appears to take on the color of the word that precedes it. When it is followed by certain words like ""wif,"" it appears to take on a predetermined color (in this case, ""red"").

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> meaning. Rule: When ""bluf"" directly follows another word, the output color for ""bluf"" is the same as the color for the word preceding it. When ""bluf"" directly precedes ""wif,"" it changes the output color for ""bluf"" to red. The effect of ""bluf"" on words that follow it does not seem to apply a consistent rule that we can deduce from the given examples, except when it precedes ""wif.""",0.9,132,bluf
"walm -> meaning. Based on the input and output examples provided, ""walm"" translates to the repetition of the color associated with the word just before it three times. 

Rule: When ""walm"" follows another word, it causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to be output three times. 

Example mapping: 
- ""zup"" means yellow, thus ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- ""dax"" means green, thus ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green.""
- ""lug"" means blue, but there's no instance of ""lug walm"" to confirm if it would lead to ""blue blue blue."" However, ""zup walm lug"" does result in ""yellow yellow yellow blue,"" suggesting ""lug"" on its own simply means blue.",1.0,132,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. For instance:

- In ""zup walm"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"", indicating a repetition of the color three times.
- In ""dax walm"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and the output is ""green green green"", also a threefold repetition of the color.
- When ""walm"" is followed by another word such as ""lug"" in ""dax walm lug"", the pattern continues after adding the color for ""lug"", which is ""blue"".

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" in this context is:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,132,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" means repeat the color associated with the preceding word.

Examples:
- In ""zup walm"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", so ""walm"" means to repeat ""yellow"" three times.
- In ""dax walm"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", so ""walm"" means to repeat ""green"" three times.
- In ""zup walm lug"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". ""Walm"" causes ""yellow"" to repeat three times, followed by the ""blue"" associated with ""lug"".",1.0,132,walm
"Based on the presented examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" corresponds to the repeating of the color that immediately follows the preceding word three times:

- In the first example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"", so after ""zup,"" the color ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""dax walm lug"" becomes ""green green green blue"". Here, ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and the color ""green"" is repeated three times followed by the color ""blue"" for ""lug.""
- In the third example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"", following the same pattern as before.
- The fourth example, ""wif zup walm dax zup"", translates to ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow."" This suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""walm"" resulted in the triplication of the color following ""zup,"" in this case ""yellow.""
- The fifth example matches the second example and follows the same rule.

The consistent pattern indicates that ""walm"" causes the color term that would follow it to be said three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the next color word to be repeated three times.",1.0,132,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" consistently translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"". Each appearance of ""walm"" is followed by the output of ""yellow"" repeated three times, regardless of the words that precede or follow it. Here is the breakdown:

- Input: dax walm | Output: green green green
- Input: wif zup walm dax zup | Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
- Input: zup walm lug | Output: yellow yellow yellow blue

In the third example, ""dax walm"", ""walm"" still results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" and ""dax"" is consistently associated with green (in all instances where ""dax"" appears, it is followed by green outputs), reinforcing the pattern that ""walm"" equates to three yellows.

- Example 2: The single word ""dax"" results in ""green.""
- Example 3: ""dax"" appears at the end of the sequence and is still followed by ""green.""
- Example 4: ""dax"" is at the beginning of the sequence and maps to ""green.""

The rest of the words (""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""wif,"" ""walm,"" ""bluf"") yield different colors (yellow, blue, red), but ""dax"" consistently corresponds to green regardless of its position in the list or the other words present.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,133,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the instances where it occurs and the output provided:

- ""dax zup bluf"" corresponds to ""green yellow yellow""
- ""dax lug wif walm"" corresponds to ""green blue red red red""
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" corresponds to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue""
- ""dax"" on its own corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup bluf lug dax lug"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow blue green blue""

In all cases where ""dax"" occurs:
- It corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.
- No other word seems to consistently correspond to the color ""green"".
- It does not seem to impact the color associated with other words.

Based on these observations, the rule for the meaning of ""dax"" appears to be:

Rule: The word ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green"".",1.0,133,dax
"Based on the given examples, it appears that each word is associated with a particular color when translated into the output. The color that corresponds to the word ""dax"" is consistently green, regardless of its position in the input. The repeated occurrence of ""dax"" always maps to ""green,"" and no other word has resulted in the color green in the output. Therefore, the meaning attributed to the word ""dax,"" in this context, is the color green.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,133,dax
"From the provided examples, it seems that the output colors correspond to the nonce words in a certain way. Let's examine each instance where ""dax"" appears:

3. ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue blue green blue""
4. ""dax"" -> ""green""
5. ""zup bluf lug dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow blue green blue""

It is clear from these examples that every time ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""green."" Whether ""dax"" is at the beginning, middle, or end of the sequence, and no matter what other words are present, the output associated with ""dax"" is consistently ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,133,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the color output associated with the word ""dax"" is always ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,133,dax
"Based on the examples provided:

""wif"" alone outputs ""red"".
When ""wif"" is combined with ""dax lug walm,"" it results in ""red green blue blue blue."" It seems that each word after ""wif"" adds one more color:
- ""dax"" -> ""green""
- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- ""walm"" -> ""blue blue""

In the third example, ""lug wif zup wif walm,"" the output sequence is ""blue red yellow red red red."" Here ""wif"" is preceded by ""lug"" and produces ""red"" (the same as when ""wif"" stands alone), and when ""wif"" is followed by ""zup,"" the result is ""yellow red,"" indicating that ""zup"" alone would correspond to ""yellow."" When ""wif"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""walm,"" it leads to ""red red red,"" which is consistent with ""walm"" being ""blue blue,"" with ""wif"" adding another ""red.""

In the fourth example, ""dax zup wif,"" the output is ""green yellow red,"" where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" again results in ""red.""

In the fifth example, ""zup bluf wif dax lug,"" the output is ""yellow yellow red green blue,"" which demonstrates that ""wif"" retains its output ""red"" regardless of its position between ""bluf"" and ""dax,"" and it does not seem to be influenced by the presence of ""bluf.""

The rules deduced from these examples indicate that:
1. ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
2. The presence of other words does not appear to alter the meaning of ""wif.""
3. The meaning of ""wif"" appears to be independent of its position within the sequence of words.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,133,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following correlations between inputs and outputs:

- Whenever the single word ""wif"" appears as input, the output is ""red"".
- When ""wif"" appears with other words, it seems to contribute one occurrence of ""red"" to the output, regardless of its position in the input list.
- There are no examples where ""wif"" affects the colors associated with other words or changes the pattern in an unpredictable way.

The other words in the inputs have consistent outputs, which can be inferred as follows:
- ""dax"" always translates to ""green"".
- ""lug"" always translates to ""blue"".
- ""walm"" outputs a sequence of ""blue blue"".
- ""zup"" always translates to ""yellow"".
- The word ""bluf"" has only one occurrence and corresponds to ""yellow"", the same output as ""zup"", but with the single occurrence in the examples, it's not enough to conclude a rule for ""bluf"".

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" can be inferred as consistently mapping to the color ""red"", and it does not seem to be context-dependent or affect the interpretation of other words.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,133,wif
"Based on the examples provided, each instance where the nonce word ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red."" There are no examples showing that wif has a different meaning in different contexts. Therefore, the rule appears to be quite simple:

In this example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" ""Walm"" is followed by ""blue blue,"" which would indicate a doubling effect, or that ""walm"" translates to repeating the color word that just appeared before it.

Input: lug wif zup wif walm

Here we see ""lug"" again corresponding to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" ""Wif"" shows up twice and is translated to ""red"" both times, which is consistent with the first example. ""Walm"" again seems to be followed by a repetition of the previous color word, supporting the doubling effect.

Input: dax zup wif
Output: green yellow red

This example has ""dax"" translating to ""green"" and ""zup"" translating to ""yellow"" again, and ""wif"" translates to ""red."" There are no contradictions here.

Input: zup bluf wif dax lug
Output: yellow yellow red green blue

""Zup"" is consistent with ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" is consistent with ""red."" ""Bluf"" could also mean yellow here, or it could have no meaning on its own but serve as a repetition of the preceding color since it is followed by another ""yellow"" in the output. Given that ""walm"" was deduced as repeating the previous word, it might be possible that ""bluf"" is a single repetition whereas ""walm"" may indicate a double repetition. However, there is not enough information to firmly establish what ""bluf"" means. 

Based on the above examination of the examples, it is safe to conclude:
Rule: wif -> red",1.0,133,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the meaning of ""wif"" and establish a rule for it by examining the output associated with each input:

Input: wif -> Output: red
Input: wif dax lug walm -> Output: red green blue blue blue
Input: lug wif zup wif walm -> Output: blue red yellow red red red
Input: dax zup wif -> Output: green yellow red
Input: zup bluf wif dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow red green blue

From the examples, we can see that every time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output, regardless of the position of ""wif"" within the sequence of words in the input.

Therefore, the rule we can establish is:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".",1.0,133,wif
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present.",1.0,133,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the word ""zup."" Here are the relevant parts of each example:

1. Input: zup
   Output: yellow

2. Input: wif dax zup
   Output: red green yellow

3. Input: zup bluf dax
   Output: yellow yellow green

4. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

5. Input: lug bluf zup
   Output: blue blue yellow

From Example 1, we can see that ""zup"" in isolation translates directly to ""yellow.""

In the following examples, each input word corresponds to a color in the output. For instance, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" Regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input or the combination of other words, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" seems to be independent of its position in the sentence or the presence of other words. The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,133,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following rule for the nonce word 'bluf':

- Whenever 'bluf' appears immediately after another word, the color associated with 'bluf' is the same as the color associated with the word before it.

Let's verify this rule with the examples:

1. Input: zup bluf wif 
   Output: yellow yellow red
   (The color before 'bluf' is 'yellow' and hence 'bluf' is also 'yellow'.)

2. Input: wif dax bluf

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word",1.0,133,bluf
"Looking at the sequences provided, we can attempt to deduce the rule that defines what ""bluf"" means based on the colors associated with it in the output.

From the given examples:

- ""zup bluf"" consistently leads to ""yellow yellow""
- ""dax bluf"" consistently leads to ""green green""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" or ""dax"", the color that follows ""bluf"" is always the same as the color that precedes it.
- ""bluf"" does not have a color associated with it independently, as it is never given a color in a standalone context.

Therefore, we can infer that ""bluf"" serves as an indicator to repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,133,bluf
"Looking at the examples, we can try to deduce the underlying rule for the word ""bluf."" 

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""wif,"" resulting in the colors ""yellow yellow red.""

- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""wif,"" resulting in the colors ""green green red.""

- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""zup,"" resulting in the colors ""green green yellow.""

- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows directly after ""zup,"" and the sequence is ""yellow yellow.""

- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" occurs twice. When it follows ""zup"" or ""dax,"" the color ""green"" is repeated, just like the color before ""bluf."" When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the color ""yellow"" is also repeated.

Therefore, we can deduce the rule for the word ""bluf"" as follows: bluf -> meaning. When ""bluf"" follows a color in the sequence, the output duplicates that color's word.

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color of the word before it and repeats it in the output. When it is at the end (no word follows ""bluf""), it seems there's no extra color word to add, so it just keeps the duplication rule with the previous word.",1.0,133,bluf
"bluf -> green

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color green regardless of its position in the sequence.",0.0,133,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat the color that was generated by the word immediately preceding it. The number of repetitions corresponds to the number of times ""walm"" is mentioned. To confirm and illustrate:

- In ""dax lug walm"", ""lug"" produces the color blue, and ""walm"" causes the color blue to be repeated an extra time, resulting in ""green blue blue blue"".
- In ""zup walm wif"", ""zup"" produces the color yellow, and ""walm"" causes the color yellow to be repeated multiple times, ending with ""wif"" changing the sequence with red, to result in ""yellow yellow yellow red"".
- In ""lug zup walm lug"", ""zup"" produces yellow, followed by ""walm"" which repeats the color yellow, before ""lug"" produces blue, resulting in ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"".
- In ""dax walm"", ""dax"" produces green and ""walm"" repeats the color green twice, for a total of three greens: ""green green green"".

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word multiple times, equal to the number of times ""walm"" appears in sequence.",1.0,133,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's consider each input and its corresponding output:

2. Input: zup walm wif

3. Input: lug zup walm lug

4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

In each case, ""walm"" appears to replace the color of the word that precedes it with sequences of that color. When ""walm"" appears, it copies the color linked to the immediately preceding word for all subsequent positions until a new color word appears.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word for the remaining positions unless interrupted by a new color word.",1.0,133,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" maps to repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it. To break it down further:

- In the first example, ""dax lug walm,"" the output is ""green blue blue blue."" Here, ""walm"" refers to repeating the color associated with ""lug,"" which is blue, three times.
- In the second example, ""zup walm wif,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow red."" ""Walm"" in this case repeats the color associated with ""zup,"" which is yellow, three times before moving on to ""wif.""
- The third example, ""lug zup walm lug,"" has an output of ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" Here again, ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color from ""zup,"" which is yellow, three times, and is then followed by ""lug,"" which is blue.
- In the fourth example, ""dax walm,"" the output is ""green green green."" ""Walm"" leads to a repetition of the color associated with ""dax"" (green) three times.
- The fifth example, ""lug zup walm lug,"" is identical to the third example and thus leads to the identical output of ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" reinforcing the established pattern.

So, ""walm"" indicates the repetition of the color corresponding to the word that appears immediately before it, occurring three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,133,walm
"walm -> repeats the color of the previous word.

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the output of a sequence of colors that repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" multiple times.

In the first and third examples, the repeating pattern is interrupted by following words, but it starts with a repetition corresponding to the preceding word.

The rule for ""walm"" appears to be that the output color repeats the color related to the word preceding ""walm"" for a total of three repeats (unless the pattern is cut short by the end of the list or another word, as seen in the examples).

- ""zup lug"" outputs ""yellow blue,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""lug bluf"" outputs ""blue blue,"" here ""lug"" is the first ""blue"".
- ""dax lug"" outputs ""green blue,"" and ""lug"" aligns with ""blue"" once more.

"Based on the examples provided, ""dax"" consistently maps to the output ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, we can deduce that ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,134,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce a rule for what ""dax"" represents. Here's the deduction process:

Looking at the input and correlate output strings:

1. ""dax wif"" corresponds to ""green red.""
2. ""dax bluf wif lug zup"" corresponds to ""green green red blue yellow.""
3. ""zup dax"" corresponds to ""yellow green.""
4. ""zup bluf dax"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow green.""
5. ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" corresponds to ""blue red green green red blue.""

Analyzing these pairs, we can identify the following patterns:

- Every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
- The order of other words in the input correlates to specific colors in the output (""wif"" to ""red,"" ""bluf"" to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow"").
- The occurrence of ""dax"" does not affect the output of other words in the string; it is independent and maps directly to ""green"" regardless of where it appears or repetition of other words.

Based on this analysis, the rule for ""dax"" is straightforward:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,134,dax
"dax -> green

- When it is part of a longer string, ""dax"" is still consistently translated to ""green,"" as seen in ""dax bluf wif lug zup,"" which results in ""green green red blue yellow.""
- Regardless of where ""dax"" appears in the sequence (either before or after other words), its output is ""green,"" as demonstrated in the third and fourth examples: ""zup dax"" (yellow green) and ""zup bluf dax"" (yellow yellow green).

"By examining the provided examples and their corresponding outputs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""zup"". Let's analyze each input-output pair to identify the pattern.

1. Input: dax wif zup dax

   Observation: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""zup"" occurs in between with an output of ""yellow"".

2. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
   Observation: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""bluf"" to ""yellow"", and ""zup"" again corresponds to ""yellow"". ""zup"" seems to precede ""blue"", and when it follows ""blue"", it produces ""yellow"".
   
3. Input: lug dax zup

5. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   Observation: ""lug"" to ""blue"" and ""walm"" to ""green"", but interestingly, after ""zup"", the sequence continues with ""blue"" and not ""green"".

From these observations, it is evident that regardless of the preceding or following word, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"". There doesn't appear to be a dependency on the context.

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" is as follows:

zup -> yellow",1.0,134,zup

2. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug

5. Input: lug walm zup lug walm

   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

In every example, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Thus, it seems that the meaning of ""zup"" is consistent and does not depend on the context.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,134,zup
"Analyzing the given examples and their outputs, I notice that:

Based on this analysis, it seems that ""zup"" translates directly to the color ""yellow"" irrespective of its context within the sequence. Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow.

1. ""wif"" appears before ""bluf"" - ""red"" appears twice in the output.
2. ""wif"" is still before ""bluf"" despite ""zup"" being added to the beginning - ""red"" appears twice after ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"".
3. Here ""wif"" is before ""bluf"", but ""zup"" is now between them - only one ""red"" and two ""yellows"", likely influenced by ""zup"" but keeping in line with the rule that ""bluf"" repeats the color word before it.

"Based on the given examples, the rule seems to associate ""bluf"" with the duplication of the color associated with the preceding word. Here's the breakdown:

- wif bluf -> red red (The color red associated with ""wif"" is duplicated.)
- zup wif bluf -> yellow red red (The color yellow associated with ""zup"" is duplicated, but following ""wif"" which is red.)

- wif bluf zup -> red red yellow (The color red associated with ""wif"" is duplicated before the color associated with ""zup,"" which is yellow.)
- lug bluf -> blue blue (The color blue associated with ""lug"" is duplicated.)

Based on the patterns observed, the rule for ""bluf"" can be described as follows:

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a word, it causes the output color for the preceding word to be repeated. If there are multiple words with associated colors before ""bluf,"" only the color of the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" is repeated. If ""bluf"" is the last word, its preceding color is echoed last.

- In the first example, ""wif"" is turned into ""red"", and then ""bluf"" doubles the color output so we get ""red red"".
- In the second example, ""zup"" turns into ""yellow"", then ""wif"" translates to ""red"", and ""bluf"" duplicates the ""red"" to result in ""yellow red red"".
- In the third example, it seems that the position of ""zup"" changes its translation effect, turning ""wif"" into ""yellow"" instead of ""red"", and ""bluf"" duplicates this color to get ""red yellow yellow"".
- The fourth example is similar to the third one but with ""bluf"" coming after the modified color word, ""wif"", suggesting that the order affects the color ""bluf"" will duplicate.

- In the fourth example, 'lug' is followed by 'walm', and later 'zup' is followed by 'walm', with 'lug' corresponding to 'blue' and 'zup' to 'yellow'. 'Walm' repeats the previous color three times.

The rule seems consistent across all examples, therefore:

Rule: walm -> the word walm means to repeat the color name that appears directly before it three times in the output.",1.0,134,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Regardless of its position in the input string, ""lug"" always results in ""blue"" in the output sequence.",1.0,135,lug

"Based on the examples provided, each instance of the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue."" This suggests that ""lug"" translates directly to the color ""blue."" 

The other words, ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" and ""zup,"" correspond to ""red,"" ""blue,"" and ""yellow,"" respectively. However, since the word ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""blue,"" we can infer that ""bluf"" likely results in a repetition of the color it represents, hence the double ""blue blue"" in the first output.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,135,lug
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""lug"" seems to be consistently associated with the color blue in the output. When ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output.

"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output. The appearance of ""dax"" in the input is always translated to ""green,"" regardless of its position in the list of words. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,135,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that each input word corresponds to a particular color in the output. Let's analyze the patterns:

- In the first example, ""lug wif bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red red"". Since ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"" in other examples, we can infer that ""lug"" likely corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- In the second example, ""wif dax"" translates to ""red green"". We already suspect ""wif"" means ""red"", which is reinforced by this example. It’s reasonable to assume ""dax"" means ""green"".
- In the third example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" becomes ""yellow yellow red red red"". ""Bluf"" is again ""blue"" at the beginning, and since ""zup"" appears right before ""bluf"" and the output starts with ""yellow yellow"", we can infer that ""zup"" means ""yellow"". The repetition of ""red"" at the end indicates that ""walm"" might translate to two ""red""s as ""wif"" does to one.
- The fourth example, ""wif lug zup bluf"", becomes ""red blue yellow yellow"". We've seen ""lug"" as ""blue"", ""zup"" as ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" as ""blue"" in previous examples, which is consistent here, and ""wif"" remains ""red"".
- In the final example, ""wif dax wif"" results in ""red green red"". We've gathered that ""dax"" is ""green"", and since ""wif"" appears twice with ""red"" on each side of ""green"", it supports our conclusion that ""wif"" means ""red"".

Rule:
- The word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it.

Examples:
1. In ""lug bluf"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""bluf"" is also blue.
2. In ""dax bluf zup"", ""dax"" corresponds to green, so ""bluf"" is also green.
3. In ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"", the first ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" that corresponds to red, so ""bluf"" is red; the second ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" that corresponds to green, so ""bluf"" is green.
4. In ""lug zup bluf dax"", ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and corresponds to yellow, so ""bluf"" is also yellow.

Hence, the rule is:
bluf -> takes the color of the word immediately before it.",1.0,135,bluf
"Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" changes its meaning depending on the word that precedes it. Specifically, ""bluf"" takes the color corresponding to the previous word in the sequence. Here's the mapping based on the examples:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", ""bluf"" means green.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"", ""bluf"" means blue.
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", ""bluf"" means red.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", ""bluf"" means yellow.
- When ""bluf"" is the first word or follows itself, its meaning is blue based on the second example ""lug bluf"" which outputs ""blue blue"".

So, the rule is: bluf -> takes the color of the word preceding it; if it has no predecessor or follows itself, it defaults to blue.",1.0,135,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately follows it. If ""bluf"" is at the end of a sequence, it takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

bluf -> the color of the following word, or if it is at the end, the color of the preceding word.",0.8,135,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond with the color that matches the color word that came immediately before ""bluf"" in the input. Here is the rule induction based on the examples:

- In the first example, ""dax"" comes before ""bluf"" and in the output ""green"" is before the first ""red"". Noticing that the second ""dax"" also outputs ""green"" on the output but the first ""bluf"" has ""red"", it seems there is an inconsistency if we consider ""bluf"" to mean the same as the preceding word.

- In the second example, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" and ""blue"" is the color for both in the output.

- In the third example, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and ""green"" is the color for both in the output.

- In the fourth example, ""wif"" precedes the first ""bluf"" and both have ""red"" in the output. The second ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and both have ""green"" in the output.

- In the fifth example, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output for both is ""yellow"".

If we revise our initial observation with the first example, considering that ""bluf"" might not be a direct representation of the color that precedes it but could instead indicate that the same color should be repeated, it could explain why the first ""red"" appears. Indeed, if ""bluf"" means repeat the last color, ""dax"" (green) is followed by ""bluf"", therefore, ""red"" which doesn't follow our rule. Then, the next color is ""dax"" which leads to ""green"" following our first logical rule. However, the word ""wif"" is not before any ""bluf"" but also gives ""red"". This breaks the pattern that ""bluf"" represents a repetition of the last color seen. 

Given the inconsistencies and contradictions in the first example, a definitive rule for ""bluf"" cannot be determined based on the current data. More consistent data would be required to accurately determine the rule for ""bluf"".",0.2,135,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" reflects the color of the word that follows it. If ""bluf"" appears at the end of a sequence, it takes the color of the word that precedes it. 

Evidence:
- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"", and the output is ""red green"". Since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""bluf"" takes the color ""red"" from the preceding word ""wif"".
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", and the output is ""blue blue"". ""Bluf"" takes the color of ""lug"", which is ""blue"".
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup"", and the output is ""green green yellow"". Here, ""bluf"" again takes the color of the preceding word ""dax"", which is ""green"".
- In the fourth input, ""bluf"" appears twice and each time it takes the color of the word following it. When ""bluf"" is at the end, it takes the color of the preceding word ""wif"" which is ""red"".
- In the fifth input, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" and both are assigned the color ""yellow"", which implies ""bluf"" took the color of ""zup"" which is ""yellow"".

Hence:

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns in the given examples.

- In the first example, ""zup walm dax"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow green."" Since ""zup"" on its own elsewhere translates to a singular ""yellow"" and ""dax"" translates to a singular ""green,"" it seems that ""walm"" is linked to the repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it.
  
- In the second example, ""wif dax zup walm,"" the pattern ""red green yellow yellow yellow"" is seen. Here again, ""walm"" seems to follow the same rule of repeating the color linked to the preceding word.

- In the third example, ""wif walm dax zup,"" we get ""red red red green yellow."" ""walm"" follows the word ""wif,"" and the color ""red"" is repeated three times, suggesting that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it.

- In the fourth example, ""zup walm,"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" The presence of ""walm"" after ""zup"" again causes the ""yellow"" to be repeated.

- In the fifth example, ""dax walm,"" gives us ""green green green,"" reinforcing the idea that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color linked to the previous word.

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,135,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems the word ""walm"" determines the color that the word before it will translate to. We can infer this from observing that the color repeated in the output corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm"":

- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"", thus ""zup"" should translate to ""yellow"".
- In ""wif walm dax zup"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and after ""walm"" is introduced, ""red"" is repeated three times.
- Similarly, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"", indicating ""dax"" translates to ""green"".

There's no direct information about the translation of ""walm"" on its own, but based on the consistency of the other words' outputs, we deduce that ""walm"" causes the preceding word to repeat its output color thrice.

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding word's associated color to repeat three times.",1.0,135,walm
"Based on the examples provided, walm seems to correspond with repeating the color associated with the word just before it, for as many times as walm would conceptually signify. Observing the patterns:

- In ""zup walm dax,"" walm results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which is the color associated with ""zup"" repeated three times before the color for ""dax"" (green) appears.
- In ""wif dax zup walm,"" walm produces ""yellow yellow yellow,"" following the colors for ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup"" (red, green, and yellow).
- In ""wif walm dax zup,"" walm leads to ""red red red,"" which is the color for ""wif"" repeated three times, then followed by the colors for ""dax"" and ""zup"" (green and yellow).
- In ""zup walm,"" walm results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" following the color for ""zup"" without any succeeding colors, as there are no more words after walm.
- In ""dax walm,"" walm results in ""green green green,"" which is the color for ""dax"" repeated three times without any following colors.

From these examples, it seems that walm causes the output to be three instances of the color associated with the preceding word. There is not enough information to conclude if the number of repetitions is always fixed to three or if it varies under certain conditions, as it is always three in the given examples. However, for the sake of rule induction from these specific examples, we can deduce the following:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,135,walm
"Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" seems to correspond to a repetition of the color associated with the word that directly precedes it.

Here’s how it breaks down:

""zup walm dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green"" (zup corresponds to yellow and is repeated three times due to walm, then dax corresponds to green)

""wif dax zup walm"" -> ""red green yellow yellow yellow"" (walm follows zup and repeats the yellow color associated with zup three times)

""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow"" (walm follows wif and repeats the red color associated with wif three times)

""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"" (walm repeats the yellow associated with zup three times)

""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"" (walm repeats the green associated with dax three times)

So the rule can be stated as:

Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,135,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the positions of ""walm"" and the corresponding color outputs:

1. In ""zup walm dax,"" ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow green.""
2. In ""wif dax zup walm,"" ""walm"" is at the end and follows ""zup"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
3. In ""wif walm dax zup,"" ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" resulting in ""red red red green.""
4. In ""zup walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""zup"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
5. In ""dax walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""dax"" resulting in ""green green green.""

Rule:
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output color is yellow.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output color is green.
- ""walm"" by itself does not have a definitive color associated with it, but it seems to take the color of the word it follows.
- Also, the color output is repeated three times, followed by a different color when ""dax"" is in the sequence before or after ""walm."" In sequences where ""dax"" is not present, only the repeated color is shown.
  
Given these observations, we can deduce the following rule for ""walm"":

walm -> meaning: When following ""zup,"" the output is yellow. When following ""dax,"" the output is green. ""Walm"" causes the preceding word's associated color to repeat thrice, followed by another color defined by the presence and position of ""dax.""",0.9,135,walm
"Based on the examples given, ""lug"" appears to consistently map to ""blue."" There is no contextual variation in the meaning; ""lug"" always results in ""blue"" in the output regardless of its position or neighboring words.

5. ""dax zup walm wif walm"" translates to ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red."" In this sequence, ""walm"" seems to have multiple outputs (yellow and red), complicating the pattern. However, ""zup"" continues to correspond to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,136,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the meaning of zup is independent from its position in the sequence and is consistently translated to the same color. Each example that includes ""zup"" results in the word ""yellow"" in the corresponding position of the output.

Looking at the correlation between the input and output sequences:

1. ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" -> ""green green red yellow red""
   ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow"" independent of the surrounding words.

2. ""dax walm zup lug dax"" -> ""green green green yellow blue green""
   ""zup"" is again translated to ""yellow"" no matter what other words precede or follow it.

3. ""zup dax zup"" -> ""yellow green yellow""
   ""zup"" at the beginning and in the middle of the sequence is translated to ""yellow"" both times.

5. ""dax zup walm wif walm"" -> ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red""
   ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow"", and the multiple instances of ""walm"" afterwards are all translated to ""yellow"" as well.

However, the presence of other words like ""walm"" that seem to have different translations (sometimes ""green"" and multiple ""yellow"" in the last example) might suggest an underlying rule that affects ""walm"". But since the meaning of ""zup"" remains consistent, we can conclude that the rule for ""zup"" is invariant of the context.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we will look at the relationship between the inputs containing ""walm"" and their corresponding outputs.

1. Input: wif walm --> Output: red red red
   This input contains the word ""wif"" followed by ""walm,"" and the output is three instances of ""red"". ""Walm"" here may be associated with repeating the color corresponding to the word before it.

2. Input: dax walm --> Output: green green green
   Similarly to example 1, the word ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" and the output is three instances of ""green"". Again, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word that precedes it.

3. Input: zup walm wif --> Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   The word ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" which is then followed by ""wif,"" and the output is three instances of ""yellow"" followed by ""red"". We see ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in thrice repetition of ""yellow,"" the corresponding color for ""zup,"" followed by the color for ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

4. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif --> Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   The word ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"" and then ""dax,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and a second ""wif."" The output is three instances of ""blue,"" followed by ""green,"" one ""red,"" another ""blue,"" and a final ""red"". ""Walm"" after ""lug"" leads to the repetition of ""blue,"" with succeeding words having their colors listed in order.

5. Input: dax walm lug --> Output: green green green blue
   ""Dax"" precedes ""walm"" which is followed by ""lug,"" and the output is three instances of ""green"" followed by ""blue,"" the color corresponding to ""lug"".

Based on these examples, ""walm"" appears to cause the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it three times. Thus,

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately before it, three times.",1.0,136,walm
"Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" seems to correspond to a repeating color that is determined by the word that precedes it. Specifically, ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word in the following manner:

- ""wif walm"" produces ""red red red,"" where the color red is associated with ""wif.""
- ""dax walm"" produces ""green green green,"" where the color green is associated with ""dax.""
- ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow,"" where the color yellow is associated with ""zup.""
- ""lug walm"" produces ""blue blue blue,"" where the color blue is associated with ""lug.""

When placed after a word with an associated color, ""walm"" causes the output to repeat that color three times.

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times.",1.0,136,walm
"Analyzing the given examples, I will start by looking at the output whenever the nonce word ""walm"" is present:

1. wif walm -> red red red
2. dax walm -> green green green
3. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red
4. lug walm dax wif -> blue blue blue green red
5. dax walm lug -> green green green blue

In each instance, the presence of ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here's the breakdown:

- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"" (wif correlates with red). 
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" (dax correlates with green). 
- ""zup walm wif"" includes ""yellow yellow yellow"" (zup correlates with yellow) followed by ""red"" (wif correlates with red, but there's no repeat since ""walm"" comes before ""wif"").
- ""lug walm dax wif"" has ""blue blue blue"" (lug correlates with blue) followed by ""green"" (dax correlates with green) and then ""red"" (wif correlates with red).
- ""dax walm lug"" includes ""green green green"" (dax correlates with green) followed by ""blue"" (lug correlates with blue).

Based on these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" indicates that the color associated with the preceding word should be repeated three times. 

Therefore:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,136,walm
"walm -> meaning. Meaning appears to be a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it, and the color is repeated three times.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, it causes the output to be the color associated with that word repeated three times. If ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red""; if ""dax"" precedes it, the output is ""green green green""; if ""lug"" precedes it, the output is ""blue blue blue""; and if ""zup"" precedes it, the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"".",1.0,136,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output, irrespective of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,137,lug
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue in the output. Therefore, the rule can be stated simply as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,137,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the output is ""blue.""",1.0,137,lug
"Rule: lug -> blue

The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" across all examples given.",1.0,137,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: Every time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output.",1.0,137,lug
"To deduce what ""dax"" means in this context, we can analyze the patterns and commonalities in the examples provided. Each example begins with ""dax,"" and the corresponding output always begins with ""green."" This consistent occurrence suggests that ""dax"" is directly related to the color ""green."" 

Now, let's consider the other words and their respective colors to determine if there is a one-to-one correspondence or if ""dax"" has an effect on the other words:

- lug consistently translates to ""blue,"" as seen in examples 1, 3, and 5.
- walm translates to ""blue blue"" when following ""lug dax lug"" in example 1 but translates to ""red"" when following ""wif"" in example 5. This indicates there may be an intervening rule or context dependency.
- wif consistently translates to ""red,"" seen in examples 2 and 5.
- zup consistently translates to ""yellow,"" as seen in examples 3 and 5.
- bluf translates to ""blue,"" seen in example 3.

Considering the above analysis, ""dax"" seems to directly correspond to ""green."" It appears as the first word in the input sequence, and the first color in the output sequence is always ""green"" when ""dax"" is present. There's no sign that ""dax"" modifies the meanings of the following words under the given examples. However, there may be an unwritten rule impacting when ""walm"" translates to ""blue blue"" or ""red,"" possibly dependent on its position or surrounding words.

Rule:
dax -> green

This rule means that ""dax"" represents the color ""green,"" and that association does not change regardless of context in the given examples.",1.0,137,dax
"Given the examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" Hence, the rule appears to be that whenever the word ""dax"" is encountered, it translates to the color ""green.""

The rule can be written as:

dax -> green

However, it might be worth noticing that there isn't enough context to deduce the meanings of the other words with certainty, but we can speculate based on frequency:

- ""lug"" mostly corresponds to ""blue"" in the given context.
- ""wif"" appears to be ""red"" based on only two data points.
- ""walm"" seems to be ""red"" based on one instance and ""blue"" on another, so it's unclear.
- ""zup"" might correspond to ""yellow,"" but again, there is only a single instance.
- ""bluf"" has only appeared once and corresponds to ""blue.""

These associations are not definitive and would require additional examples to establish a clear and consistent rule.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,137,dax
"Based on the given examples, it is possible to deduce that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output at the same position. No other words follow this consistent pattern.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,137,dax
"Based on the input and output examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Here is the rule deduced from the examples:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,137,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we can analyze each of the given input-output pairings, looking for consistent patterns in how the word ""dax"" correlates with parts of the output.

1. With ""dax lug dax lug walm,"" the output is ""green blue green blue blue blue."" The word ""lug"" is consistently followed by ""blue,"" and ""dax"" matches ""green."" The output ""blue blue"" at the end corresponds to the single input word ""walm,"" indicating that this word maps to a double ""blue blue.""

2. With ""dax wif,"" the output is ""green red."" Here we see ""dax"" again matches with ""green,"" and ""wif"" correlates with ""red.""

3. With ""dax zup lug bluf,"" the output is ""green yellow blue blue."" The word ""lug"" produces ""blue"" again, ""zup"" yields ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" is ""green."" The word ""bluf"" leads to a double ""blue,"" similar to how ""walm"" produced a double blue in the first example.

4. With ""dax,"" the output is simply ""green,"" confirming that ""dax"" by itself translates to ""green.""

5. With ""dax wif walm lug zup,"" the output is ""green red red red blue yellow."" This sequence confirms the previous associations: ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" However, the word ""wif"" this time is followed by three occurrences of ""red,"" unlike the single red from the second example. This discrepancy suggests that the frequency of the output color might depend on context or position, but since it follows ""dax,"" which is green every time, counting won't help here. The ""walm"" having a triple ""red"" following it as compared to the double ""blue"" in the first example shows there may not be a simple one-to-one correspondence between input words and output color sequences.

Based on these observations, the most consistent rule we can deduce is that:

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Other words in the sequence appear to dictate different output colors and can affect the number of times those colors appear, but ""dax"" always results in a single ""green"" in the output.",1.0,137,dax
"Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""",1.0,137,wif
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red.""

Here is the breakdown of the correspondence based on the examples:

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" at the end of the sequence also corresponds to ""red.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" at the beginning of the sequence corresponds to ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" is in the middle of the sequence, preceded by ""bluf"" and followed by ""dax,"" yet it still corresponds to ""red.""
- Finally, in the fifth example, when ""wif"" is presented alone, the output is solely ""red.""

From this set of data, it appears that the word ""wif"" is not context-dependent; its meaning is consistent regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,137,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The presence of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.",1.0,137,wif

Input: wif bluf lug

Output: yellow yellow red green blue

The rule appears to be that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a color.

No other context is provided that links ""zup"" to any other word, pattern, or rule that would allow for a different interpretation. Therefore, the meaning of ""zup"" can be deduced to be the color ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,137,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word that immediately precedes it.

1. In ""zup bluf dax,"" zup corresponds to yellow, and bluf takes on the color yellow, which corresponds to zup. So in this context, bluf -> yellow.

2. In ""lug wif bluf,"" wif corresponds to red, and bluf takes on the color red, which corresponds to wif. So in this context, bluf -> red.

3. In ""dax bluf,"" dax corresponds to green, and bluf also takes on the color green, which corresponds to dax. So here, bluf -> green.

4. In ""zup bluf lug dax lug,"" zup corresponds to yellow, so bluf takes on the color yellow. In the sequence ""lug dax lug,"" the color names do not change, and bluf is not present to potentially alter the pattern, suggesting that bluf only takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

5. In ""zup wif bluf,"" zup is yellow, but bluf is red, which comes from the color corresponding to wif. This further supports that bluf's color is derived from the word right before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,137,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red whenever ""wif"" is present before ""bluf"", and to the color yellow whenever ""zup"" is present before ""bluf"". When ""bluf"" is present after ""dax"" or on its own with ""dax"", it corresponds to the color green. Not enough information is provided for other scenarios, so the rule is only applicable to these specific cases. The rule seems context-dependent. In summary:

- ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow"", indicating that ""bluf"" means ""yellow"" after ""zup"".
- ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red"", indicating that ""bluf"" means ""red"" after ""wif"".
- ""dax bluf"" leads to ""green green"", indicating that ""bluf"" means ""green"" after ""dax"".

Therefore, the word ""bluf"" changes meaning based on the word that precedes it in the sequence. The rule can be formulated as the following:

Rule: ""bluf"" means ""yellow"" after ""zup"", ""red"" after ""wif"", and ""green"" after ""dax"".",0.9,137,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the examples and their corresponding outputs:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf dax"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow green."" Since ""zup"" and ""dax"" are in other examples and correspond to ""yellow"" and ""green"" respectively, ""bluf"" in this context corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""lug wif bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red red."" Since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in another example and ""wif"" is not in the other examples, it could either correspond to ""red"" or ""bluf"" could be varying based on context. However, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue,"" so in this context, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the third example, ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green."" Since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in other examples, ""bluf"" in this context also corresponds to ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup bluf lug dax lug"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow blue green blue."" Since ""zup"" and ""dax"" correspond to ""yellow"" and ""green"" respectively, and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" here, matching the color associated with ""zup.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow red red."" Since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in other examples, and ""wif"" is not in the other examples, it could either correspond to ""red"" or ""bluf"" could be varying based on context. However, since ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" here, similar to the second example.

Given the above analysis, the rule for the word ""bluf"" seems to depend on the context—it corresponds to the color of the word that either directly precedes it or has a strong pattern association in the sentence.

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color meaning of the immediately preceding word or matches a color that has established a pattern with the word that ""bluf"" follows.

In summary, ""bluf"" does not have a fixed meaning; instead, it changes based on the context of the word that comes before it or a word that it shows a pattern relationship with in the examples provided.",0.8,137,bluf
"The examples show a consistent pattern where the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that represents the word that directly follows it. In every instance, ""bluf"" is followed by a word whose corresponding color is then duplicated in the output:

- In ""zup bluf dax"", ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"", and the color for ""dax"" (green) is replicated in the output following the color for ""bluf"" (yellow).
- In ""lug wif bluf"", ""bluf"" is followed by no word, but its corresponding color (red) is seen twice in the output.
- In ""dax bluf"", ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and both output the color green.
- In ""zup bluf lug dax lug"", ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"", and ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" in the output, which is repeated immediately after the color for ""bluf"" (yellow).
- In ""zup wif bluf"", again ""bluf"" has no word following it, but the color red is shown twice, indicating that it is replicating the color for ""wif"" (red) that comes just before it.

Given these examples, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be that it represents a color which is determined by the color of the word that follows it (assuming there is one). If there is no word following ""bluf"", the color is repeated as red for an unknown reason (due to limited context).

Rule: bluf -> represents the color of the word that follows it. If no word follows, the output color is red.",0.8,137,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" always corresponds to the color red.",0.0,137,bluf
"To figure out what ""walm"" means, let's look for patterns in the colors outputted in response to each example input.

- In the first input, ""dax zup walm wif,"" we see that the output associated with ""walm"" is three yellow followed by a red: ""yellow yellow yellow red."" However, ""zup"" which precedes it in the sequence, has an output of just one yellow. 
- In the second input, ""lug walm zup lug zup wif,"" ""lug"" always corresponds to blue and ""zup"" to yellow, with ""wif"" corresponding to red. Directly associated with ""walm,"" we again see three blue followed by a red.
- In the third sequence, ""lug wif walm,"" we can see that ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" to red, and associated with ""walm"" are three red.
- The fourth input, ""dax lug wif walm,"" produces ""green blue red red red,"" where ""walm"" correlates with three consecutive reds following ""dax,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif.""
- The last example, ""lug walm,"" gives us ""blue blue blue,"" implying ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color for ""lug,"" which is blue.

It seems that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the preceding color three times, but if followed by ""wif,"" an additional red is added at the end. In other words, ""walm"" repeats the previous color three times and if ""wif"" follows ""walm"", add red at the end.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word three times. If followed by ""wif,"" add red at the end.",1.0,137,walm
Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word in the sequence.,1.0,137,walm
"The examples each seem to have a pattern that correlates with colors. The words ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif"" each represent different colors. It can be inferred from the inputs and outputs that:

- ""dax"" corresponds to green,
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow,
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue,
- ""wif"" corresponds to red.

Looking at the word ""walm,"" it always results in a repetition of the color word that comes before it. The number of repetitions depends on the position of ""walm"" in the input series:

- If ""walm"" is preceded immediately by a color word, it turns into that color once.
- If ""walm"" is preceded by one color word and then another color word, it turns into the color two times.
- If ""walm"" is preceded by two color words and then another color word, it turns into the color three times, and so on.

So we can deduce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color that precedes it, with the number of repetitions equal to the number of color words before ""walm"" in the sequence (including the word right before ""walm"").",0.9,137,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to closely examine the patterns in the colors in relation to the presence of the word ""walm"" in the inputs and outputs. Let's look at each example:

1. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   - Here, 'dax' corresponds to green, 'zup' to yellow, and 'wif' to red. 'walm' is followed by three yellows, indicating a possible repetitive effect on the color that precedes it.

2. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
   - Here, 'lug' corresponds to blue, 'zup' to yellow, and 'wif' to red. 'walm' comes after 'lug' and results in two additional blues.

3. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   - 'lug' is followed by blue, 'wif' by red, and after 'walm' there are additional reds.

4. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
   - 'dax' is followed by green, 'lug' by blue, 'wif' by red, and 'walm' results in additional reds.

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - 'lug' corresponds to blue, and 'walm' leads to the repetition of blue.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" has the effect of repeating the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Where it precedes the final word, it also appears to add a red to the end.

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color corresponding to the preceding word. If 'walm' is before the final word, it also adds a red to the sequence.

Now, I will refine the rule considering the input where ""walm"" comes before ""wif"" and does not end with an extra red:

- In the third input, ""walm"" comes immediately before the last word ""wif,"" but there is no extra red in the output.

This leads to the updated rule:

walm -> causes the repetition of the color corresponding to the preceding word. If 'walm' is not before the final word, it adds a red to the sequence.",0.9,137,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let us analyze each example and output pair:

1. dax zup walm wif -> green yellow yellow yellow red
2. lug walm zup lug zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
3. lug wif walm -> blue red red red
4. dax lug wif walm -> green blue red red red
5. lug walm -> blue blue blue

From the pairing of inputs and outputs, it's clear that each word in the input correlates to a specific color in the output. Looking closely:

- ""dax"" correlates to ""green.""
- ""lug"" correlates to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" correlates to ""red.""

Now let us specifically look at ""walm"":

1. In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" and correlates to three ""yellow"" and one ""red.""
2. In the second example, ""walm"" is before ""zup"" and followed by ""lug,"" leading to three ""blue.""
3. In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and results in three ""red.""
4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" is at the end after ""wif"" leading to three ""red.""
5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which leads to two additional ""blue.""

From this analysis, we can deduce:

- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it causes the color of ""wif"" (red) to be repeated three more times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it causes the color of ""lug"" (blue) to be repeated two more times.
- After ""walm"" comes ""zup,"" in the second example, it interrupts the pattern and resumes with the color for ""zup"" (yellow).

Based on the pattern, ""walm"" seems to cause repetition of the color that corresponds to the word that comes immediately before it; the number of repetitions depends on whether ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (two repetitions) or ""wif"" (three repetitions). The effect of ""walm"" is interrupted if another word/color comes after it, as seen in example 2.

Hence, the rule is as follows:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" repeat the color associated with ""lug"" (blue) two more times. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" repeat the color associated with ""wif"" (red) three more times. If another word comes after ""walm,"" proceed to the next color as dictated by the following word.

So, in general:

walm -> meaning: Repetition of the previous color as specified by the context and quantity varying depending on the specific word that precedes ""walm.""",0.9,137,walm
"Rule: lug means ""repeat the color of the previous word."" If there is no previous word (as in the beginning of a sequence or after another ""lug""), it defaults to blue.",1.0,138,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,138,lug
"lug -> red when following wif, yellow when following or followed by zup, blue otherwise. Rule: The meaning of ""lug"" depends on the context of the preceding or succeeding word. If ""lug"" comes after ""wif,"" it translates to ""red."" If ""lug"" is surrounded by ""zup"" or comes after ""zup,"" it translates to ""yellow."" In all other cases, ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""",1.0,138,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" let's look at the patterns associated with its usage and the corresponding output.

Input: wif walm lug bluf -> Output: red red red blue blue
Input: wif bluf lug zup -> Output: red red blue yellow
Input: lug zup walm lug -> Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
Input: lug wif lug bluf -> Output: blue red blue blue
Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf -> Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow

First, it's clear that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. The colors ""red,"" ""blue,"" and ""yellow"" are clearly matched to the words ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" and ""zup,"" respectively. The color ""yellow"" always follows the word ""zup.""

Now let's focus on ""lug."" In the first example, the ""lug"" corresponds to two reds and a single blue, but in the context of ""wif walm lug bluf,"" it seems that ""walm"" and ""bluf"" retain their colors of red and blue, respectively. 

In the third example, after ""lug zup,"" we see ""yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""zup"" consistently translates to yellow. The presence of two ""lug"" in the example seems to result in an additional yellow, suggesting that ""lug"" might be repeating the color of the word following it, except when it's the first word. When ""lug"" is the first word, it corresponds to a blue, as seen in examples three and four.

Analyzing the fifth example, when ""lug"" follows ""zup"" or itself, it repeats the yellow color, and when it stands before ""bluf,"" it does not result in a repetition of blue but the color changes to yellow.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""lug"" repeats the color of the next word in the sequence. If ""lug"" is the first word, it corresponds to blue by default.

Rule: lug -> Repeats the color of the next word in the sequence; if it's the first word, it corresponds to blue.",0.9,138,lug
"Rule: Based on the provided examples, the word ""lug"" seems to cause a repetition of the color that follows it. When ""lug"" precedes a color word, that color word is repeated once in the output sequence, often replaced with a ""blue"" if ""lug"" comes before ""wif"":

- In example 1, ""lug bluf"" results in ""red red red blue blue"", where ""bluf"" (blue) is repeated.
- In example 2, ""lug zup"" results in ""red red blue yellow"", with ""zup"" (yellow) following the repetition pattern.
- In example 3, ""lug zup walm lug"" results in ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"", with ""lug zup"" and ""lug"" at the end causing the repetition of ""yellow"".

"Given the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" acts as a repeater or duplicator for the preceding word's associated output. When ""bluf"" follows a word, the output for that word is duplicated. Now let's look at how this rule applies in each example:

- In the first example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"", suggesting that ""dax"" on its own would output ""green"", and ""bluf"" duplicates this output.
- In the second example, ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" becomes ""yellow red red yellow blue"". Here, ""wif"" must correspond to ""red"", and the presence of ""bluf"" following it duplicates the ""red"" output. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"", with ""bluf"" having no effect since it is not following those words.
- In the third example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"", which, given the rule deduced, indicates that ""bluf"" duplicates the output for ""wif"", which is ""red"".
- In the fourth example, ""lug bluf wif"" gives ""blue blue red"". The word ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"", and ""bluf"" again duplicates the previous output. ""wif"" follows with its own output of ""red"", unaffected by ""bluf"" since it comes after.
- In the fifth example, ""dax walm wif bluf"" outputs ""green green green red red"". Here, ""dax"" and ""walm"" both appear to correlate with the output ""green"", and ""wif"" with ""red"". ""Bluf"" duplicates the outputs for ""wif"".

The rule for ""bluf"" therefore seems to be: ""bluf"" duplicates the output of the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the output of the preceding word.",1.0,138,bluf
"Observing the input-output pairs, we can deduce the following rule for the nonce word ""bluf"":

- ""bluf"" after a color word (like ""dax"" for green, ""wif"" for red, or ""lug"" for blue) results in the output repeating the color of the word preceding it.

Now let's analyze the examples to see if this rule holds true:

1. dax bluf -> green green (Here ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""dax"", which is green.)
2. zup wif bluf zup lug -> yellow red red yellow blue (The word ""bluf"" is after ""wif"" which translates to red, and ""bluf"" results in red being repeated.)
3. wif bluf -> red red (The word ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""wif"", which is red.)
4. lug bluf wif -> blue blue red (The word ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""lug"", which is blue, then the sequence continues normally.)
5. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red (The word ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and repeats its color, red, after all the greens representing ""dax"" and ""walm"".)

From the above analysis, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,138,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the relationship between the input and output words:

From the first and third examples:
- ""dax bluf"" outputs ""green green""
- ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red""

Observing these examples, it looks like ""bluf"" causes the preceding word to be repeated in the output with its corresponding color.

From the second example:
- ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" outputs ""yellow red red yellow blue""

Here, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and ""red"" is repeated. ""Zup"" is not directly followed by ""bluf,"" so its color is not repeated.

From the fourth example:
- ""lug bluf wif"" outputs ""blue blue red""

Again, the word preceding ""bluf"" (""lug"") is repeated in the output along with its color ""blue.""

From the fifth example:
- ""dax walm wif bluf"" outputs ""green green green red red""

The words ""dax"" and ""walm"" precede ""bluf"" and are both associated with the color ""green."" Thus, ""green"" is repeated twice due to ""dax"" and ""walm."" ""Wif,"" which comes after ""bluf,"" appears only once and the color ""red"" is associated with it. Since ""dax"" and ""walm"" have the same color, it may imply that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the immediately preceding word.

Based on the analysis, ""bluf"" seems to duplicate the color associated with the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the word immediately before it.",0.9,138,bluf
"Observing the input and output pairs, one can attempt to identify a pattern for the meaning of ""bluf"". The word ""bluf"" seems to always result in the word before it being repeated in the output:

- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
- ""lug bluf wif"" -> ""blue blue red""
- ""dax walm wif bluf"" -> ""green green green red red""

Based on these examples, we can induce the following rule:

bluf -> Repeats the color associated with the word that precedes it in the output.

Thus, when ""bluf"" follows a word, the color that corresponds to that word is repeated once in the output. If ""bluf"" is the last word, this pattern seems consistent. When ""bluf"" is followed by another word, the pattern continues from the next word as normal.",0.8,138,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" causes the output to be a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here's how the rule applies to each example:

- In ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" leads to the color ""green,"" and after ""bluf"" the word ""green"" is repeated once.
- In ""zup wif bluf zup lug,"" ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and after ""bluf"" the word ""red"" is repeated two times (""red red"").
- In ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" leads to the color ""red,"" and ""bluf"" causes it to be repeated once (""red red"").
- In ""lug bluf wif,"" ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and after ""bluf,"" ""blue"" is repeated once (""blue blue""), then ""wif"" leads to ""red.""
- In ""dax walm wif bluf,"" ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and after ""bluf,"" the word ""red"" is repeated twice since ""wif"" is mentioned once before ""bluf.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf causes the output to be the color associated with the immediately preceding word repeated the number of times that word appears before ""bluf."" 

bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the preceding word the number of times that word appears before ""bluf"".",0.8,138,bluf
"Rule: walm -> repeats the last color mentioned multiple times (specifically three times, based on the provided examples).",1.0,138,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer that the word ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word in the sequence. Each non-""walm"" word seems to have a color association, which is as follows:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red

Now, let's analyze the examples to deduce the rule for ""walm"":

1. Input: dax zup dax walm
   - Output: green yellow green green green 
   - After the third ""green"" associated with ""dax,"" ""walm"" induces two more ""green"" repetitions.

2. Input: zup walm lug
   - Output: yellow yellow yellow blue 
   - Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and causes two repetitions of ""yellow"" before moving on to ""lug.""

3. Input: dax walm zup walm
   - Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow 
   - ""Walm"" first causes two repetitions of ""green"" associated with ""dax,"" then it follows ""zup"" and causes two repetitions of ""yellow.""

4. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   - Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow 
   - The pattern repeats with ""wif"" causing three ""red"" due to ""walm,"" then continues normally until ""walm"" repeats the effect for ""wif"" again before finishing with ""zup"" for ""yellow.""

5. Input: lug zup dax walm
   - Output: blue yellow green green green 
   - Again, after ""dax,"" the word ""walm"" causes the ""green"" to repeat two more times.

Consistently, ""walm"" induces two additional occurrences of the color of the word that comes before it. If the preceding word were to change, it is implied that the color repeated by ""walm"" would also change accordingly.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the preceding word two additional times.",1.0,138,walm
"To figure out the rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the relationship between the input and output patterns.

1. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green

Here, 'dax' corresponds to the color 'green,' 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow,' and 'walm' seems to replicate the same color as the word before it, as we get three 'green' colors in a row.

2. Input: zup walm lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue

In this example, 'lug' corresponds to 'blue,' so if we follow the same principle, 'walm' should mean the same as the word before it, which would be 'yellow.' 

3. Input: dax walm zup walm
   Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

Here, 'walm' follows 'dax' and the colors are 'green green green,' aligning with our previous observation. Then 'walm' follows 'zup,' with the output being 'yellow yellow yellow,' confirming our rule further.

4. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

'Wif' corresponds to 'red,' and each occurrence of 'walm' after 'wif' results in a repetition of 'red.' This supports our earlier deduction. 

5. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green

In this sequence, 'walm' follows 'dax' once more, and the output is again a repetition of the color associated with 'dax,' which is 'green.'

Based on these observations, the rule for 'walm' appears to be that it replicates or repeats the color associated with the word preceding it. If 'walm' follows 'dax,' the color will be 'green'; if it follows 'zup,' the color will be 'yellow'; following 'wif' results in 'red,' and following 'lug' results in 'blue.'

Rule: walm -> Replicates the color associated with the previous word.",1.0,138,walm
"From the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the rule by comparing the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Here's the process:

- In ""dax zup dax walm"", the word ""walm"" produces three ""green"" after the sequence ""dax"". This suggests ""walm"" might be repeating the color associated with ""dax"" (which is green) three times.

- In ""zup walm lug"", the output after ""zup walm"" is ""yellow yellow yellow"", and ""lug"" has a consistent output of ""blue"". This suggests ""walm"" after ""zup"" also repeats the color associated with ""zup"" (which is yellow) three times.

- In ""dax walm zup walm"", ""dax walm"" produces ""green green green"", and ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow"". This again indicates repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

- In ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"", ""wif walm"" produces ""red red red"", then ""zup"" and ""lug"" follow the established pattern. Again, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"" followed by ""zup"".

- In ""lug zup dax walm"", ""lug"" outputs ""blue"", ""zup"" outputs ""yellow"", ""dax"" outputs ""green"", and ""dax walm"" produces ""green green green"". 

The pattern suggests that the nonce word ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> Triplicate the color associated with the word that comes directly before ""walm"".",1.0,138,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we look at how its presence alters the output sequence. In each example, we can see the following patterns:

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), the output is a series of three greens.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), the output is two additional yellows.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), the output is two additional reds.
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), the sequence does not include the word ""walm,"" so we cannot determine its effect in this case.

From the given examples, it's not entirely clear if ""walm"" directly translates to a specific color when it follows ""lug"" (blue) or if it takes on a different role due to the missing pair in the examples.

However, for the other colors, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes repetition of the color word that it follows. Specifically:

- Dax (green) => add two more greens when followed by ""walm.""
- Zup (yellow) => add two more yellows when followed by ""walm.""
- Wif (red) => add two more reds when followed by ""walm.""

With the given data, we can propose the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color word, it repeats that color two more times in the sequence. If ""walm"" follows a word that isn't previously defined by a color, such as ""lug,"" its effect cannot be determined from the examples provided.",0.8,138,walm

"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to induce the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax."" Here is an analysis of each provided example in order to deduce the rule:

- In all instances where ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- ""Dax"" does not seem to be influenced by the position in the sequence, as it maintains the same output regardless of where it is placed.
- There is no clear pattern regarding the other words (wif, bluf, lug, zup) affecting the output of ""dax.""

Given this analysis, we can infer the following rule:

dax -> meaning. Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" irrespective of its position or surrounding words.",1.0,139,dax
"Based on the given examples, each word seems to correspond to a color in the output. To determine what ""dax"" means, let's examine the appearances of ""dax"" in the input and its consistent corresponding color in the output.

Input: wif dax bluf

Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"". Since ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"" and the output is ""green"" after ""red"", ""dax"" appears to correspond to ""green"".

Input: dax
Output: green

Here, ""dax"" is the only word, and the output is ""green"". This supports the previous observation.

Input: wif bluf lug dax wif
Output: red red blue green red

In this example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" once again.

Input: dax wif
Output: green red

Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red"" as previously determined.

Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif

Rule: The examples all consistently show that the rule for ""dax"" is that it corresponds to the color ""green"".

dax -> green",1.0,139,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that when ""dax"" is used in an input, the corresponding output is ""green."" This happens regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence or the presence of other words.

This rule can be deduced because in every example where ""wif"" is present, the word ""red"" consistently appears in the output, regardless of its position or the other words around it.",1.0,139,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" seems to serve as a transition or modifier that influences the color naming sequence that follows it. When ""wif"" is used, the color word that immediately precedes it changes in the output. Here is the logic derived from the examples:

1. ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" changes to ""blue blue blue red blue blue"". Before ""wif,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""walm"" to blue, but after ""wif,"" ""lug"" changes to red.

2. ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" changes to ""blue blue red blue red red red blue"". Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to blue, but after the first ""wif,"" the subsequent ""lug"" changes to red. Then, following the second ""wif,"" the ""walm"" and ""lug"" both change to red.

3. ""dax wif"" changes to ""green red"". ""Dax"" on its own corresponds to green, but when followed by ""wif,"" it changes to red.

4. ""zup dax wif"" changes to ""yellow green red"". Here, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""dax"" to green, but ""dax wif"" changes to red.

5. ""zup wif zup dax"" changes to ""yellow red yellow green"". The first ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, but after ""wif,"" its color changes to red, and the second ""zup"" returns to yellow, with ""dax"" remaining green without ""wif"" following it.

Therefore, ""wif"" appears to cause the preceding color word to change to a specific sequence when used immediately afterward.

Rule: wif -> causes the preceding color word to change according to a specific sequence independent of the initial color.",0.8,139,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's analyze the given input-output pairs and try to identify a pattern:

- In the first input, ""lug walm wif lug bluf"", the word ""wif"" is sandwiched between ""lug"" words, and the output is ""blue blue blue red blue blue"". It seems that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red"" in this context since the output is mostly ""blue"" except for one ""red"" following ""wif.""
- In the second input, ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"", it seems that ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""walm"" to ""red"". ""wif"" appears to change the subsequent color to ""red.""
- In the third input, ""dax wif"", ""dax"" alone yields ""green"", and then ""wif"" follows as ""red.""
- In the fourth input, ""zup dax wif"", ""zup"" alone is ""yellow"", ""dax"" is ""green"", and then ""wif"" again is followed by ""red.""
- In the fifth input, ""zup wif zup dax"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and continues to be ""yellow"" after ""wif"", but ""dax"" which normally yields ""green"" comes after a ""wif"" and yields ""red.""

From these observations, we can infer that the word ""wif"" acts as a modifier that changes the subsequent translated color to ""red."" 

Rule: wif -> changes the next translated color to red.",0.8,139,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" seems to function as a color-changing operation that takes the color denoted by the word immediately preceding it and changes the output to a different specific color. The color change is dependent on the specific color word that comes before ""wif"":

- When ""lug"" (interpreted as blue) is followed by ""wif"", the output is red.
- When ""dax"" (interpreted as green) is followed by ""wif"", the output is red.
- When ""walm"" (interpreted as red) is followed by ""wif"", the output is not explicitly shown, but using the symmetry of the rule suggested by other examples, it is likely that ""wif"" would change it to blue or another color. 

Based on this pattern, it seems that ""wif"" consistently changes a color to red when following ""lug"" or ""dax"", but there is not enough data to conclude what color ""wif"" changes ""walm"" to or if the rule is more broadly applicable to other color words (since ""walm"" followed by ""wif"" may follow a similar or different pattern and there are no examples provided for color words other than ""lug"" and ""dax"").

However, for ""lug"" and ""dax"", the rule seems consistent. Therefore:

Rule: When followed by ""wif,"" the previous color word changes to red.",0.8,139,wif
"Analyzing the provided examples:

From these examples, we can try to extract the following patterns:

- The words ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup"" output a single color each time: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- When the word ""wif"" is used, it seems to generate the word ""red"" in the output sequence. However, it also seems to affect the preceding word by repeating its corresponding color again except when preceding ""walm.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" appears between ""zup"" and precedes another ""zup,"" and the output is ""red"" then ""yellow,"" meaning that in this case, ""wif"" did not repeat the color corresponding to ""zup,"" which suggests that ""wif"" doesn't repeat the color of the word that immediately follows it.

Based on the observations above:

- When ""wif"" follows ""lug,"" ""dax,"" or ""zup,"" the color corresponding to the preceding word is repeated (except when following ""zup"" and being followed by ""zup"").
- When ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" it does not repeat any color but produces ""red.""

The general rule also seems to be that ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" but can also cause the color corresponding to the previous word to repeat once prior to yielding ""red"" under certain conditions (not immediately preceding ""walm"" and not being followed by the same word it precedes).

Rule: wif -> red (may also repeat the color of the preceding word under certain conditions as described above).",0.8,139,wif

- In the first example, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
- In the second example, ""zup"" is still represented by ""yellow.""

For all examples provided, regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input sentence, it consistently translates to ""yellow"" in the output. There is no contextual variation noted that would modify the meaning of ""zup"" based on the surrounding words.

"Given the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""

4. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red
   Rule: ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which is red.

5. Input: zup lug bluf
   Output: yellow blue blue
   Rule: ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which is blue.

Notice that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word right before it. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> The word ""bluf"" represents the color of the word immediately preceding it in the sequence. If ""bluf"" is the first word, it defaults to ""green.""",1.0,139,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the previous word. 

Here's how we reach that conclusion:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and it's repeated after ""bluf.""
   
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red."" ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" which is repeated after ""bluf.""
   
3. Similarly, when ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" which is repeated after ""bluf.""
   
4. In the sequence ""dax wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" repeats the color ""red"" associated with ""wif,"" which is immediately before it.
   
5. In the last example, ""zup lug bluf,"" ""lug"" might associate with ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" repeats this as ""blue blue.""

Rule: bluf -> causes repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word in the sequence.",1.0,139,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the output associated with ""bluf"" appears to repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Here's how it works:

- In ""dax bluf"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and the output is ""green green"", indicating that ""bluf"" also means ""green"" in this context.
- In ""wif bluf dax"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""bluf"" is followed by ""red"" in the output, once again indicating that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word before it, which is ""red"" in this case.
- In ""zup bluf wif"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow"" in the output.
- In ""dax wif bluf"", ""wif"" is before ""bluf"" and corresponds to ""red"", and ""bluf"" is followed by ""red"" in the output.
- In ""zup lug bluf"", ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" and corresponds to ""blue"", and ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue"" in the output.

So the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it takes on the color meaning of the word that comes directly before it in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.",1.0,139,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" causes the output to be the same color as the color associated with the most recent word before it, repeated twice.",0.8,139,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the patterns in the color outputs and the positions of ""bluf"" in relation to the other words:

1. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
2. ""wif bluf dax"" -> ""red red green""
3. ""zup bluf wif"" -> ""yellow yellow red""
4. ""dax wif bluf"" -> ""green red red""
5. ""zup lug bluf"" -> ""yellow blue blue""

From the above examples, we can notice the following patterns:

- Whenever ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" repeated twice.
- Whenever ""wif"" follows ""bluf"", the output is ""red"" repeated twice.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow"" followed by a word that does not seem to influence the color.
- When ""wif"" is in any position other than immediately following ""bluf,"" it corresponds to the color ""red.""
- When ""zup"" is in any position other than immediately following ""bluf,"" it corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

From this, it seems that ""bluf"" repeats the output color associated with the word it immediately follows or precedes. However, in the case where ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" even though ""wif"" is usually ""red,"" the pattern does not hold when ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" as it results in ""blue blue."" Therefore, ""lug"" must correspond to the color ""blue."" This results in inconsistency since ""lug"" has no color output equivalent when it is in positions not close to ""bluf.""

Let's specify the rule to capture the consistent pattern:

Rule: ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding or following word to be repeated twice in the output, except when the word ""lug"" follows, which seems to be an exception to this pattern by generating ""blue blue,"" implying that ""lug"" itself might mean ""blue.""

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" could be summarized as:
bluf -> Repeat the color of the adjacent word. Exceptions may apply.",0.8,139,bluf
Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color.,1.0,139,walm
"Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" seems to mean repeating the color associated with the previously mentioned word. For instance, if the word before ""walm"" indicates ""blue,"" then ""walm"" would mean ""repeat the color blue.""

So, considering the examples:

- ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" follows the pattern of ""blue blue red blue red red red blue,"" where ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" which is associated with ""red,"" so ""walm"" repeats the color red until the next color word is mentioned, which in this case is ""lug"" for blue.

- ""zup walm"" follows the pattern ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" after ""zup"" (yellow) means repeating yellow.

- ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" follows the pattern ""blue blue blue red blue blue,"" where ""walm"" repeats blue until a new color is indicated by ""wif"" (red).

- ""dax lug walm"" follows the pattern ""green blue blue blue,"" where ""walm"" repeats blue after ""lug.""

- ""dax wif walm lug zup"" follows the pattern ""green red red red blue yellow,"" where ""walm"" repeats red after ""wif"" until ""lug"" introduces blue and ""zup"" changes the sequence to yellow.",1.0,139,walm
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it.,1.0,139,walm
"To figure out the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the context in which it appears and the corresponding outputs.

1. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> blue blue red blue red red red blue
2. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
3. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue
4. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
5. dax wif walm lug zup -> green red red red blue yellow

In the first example, after ""wif walm lug,"" the sequence of the output changes from ""red blue"" to ""red red red blue."" This suggests that ""walm"" may be related to repetition.

In the second example, ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which is a repetition of ""yellow.""

In the third example, ""lug walm wif"" results in ""blue blue blue red,"" where ""blue"" is repeated before the pattern changes with ""wif.""

In the fourth example, ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue,"" with ""blue"" repeated after ""walm.""

In the fifth example, ""dax wif walm lug zup"" results in ""green red red red blue yellow,"" with the ""red"" being repeated after ""walm.""

A consistent pattern in all these examples is that the presence of the word ""walm"" immediately precedes a repetition of the color indicated by the word just before ""walm."" However, the color that is repeated is also the color that is indicated by the word that follows ""walm."" Therefore, it appears that ""walm"" signifies that the color should be repeated for as many times as the colors surrounding ""walm"" match before changing to the next indicated color.

Rule: walm -> ""Repeat the color indicated by the preceding word until a different color is indicated by the following word.""",0.8,139,walm
"walm -> meaning. Rule:

Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" in each series prompts a repetition of the color that corresponds to the previous nonce word. To put this in a rule form, we could say ""walm"" means to repeat the color denoted by the immediately preceding nonce word for a set number of times, which is one less than the total number of times the word ""walm"" has appeared in the sequence so far:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""lug wif"" (blue red), which results in ""red red red"" because it's the third occurrence of ""walm"" and we have two repeats.
2. In the second example, ""walm"" is the sole word and it creates ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that it might be the first occurrence and thus prompts two repeats.
3. In the third example, ""lug walm"" (blue blue blue) suggests that ""walm"" causes the color blue to repeat two times after the first blue.
4. In the fourth example, ""lug walm"" after ""dax"" (green) gives us ""blue blue blue"", following the rule of repeating the preceding color twice.
5. In the fifth example, the ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) and thus prompts ""red red,"" and it is followed by ""lug"" (blue) and ""zup"" (yellow), carrying on the sequence.

So, we can tentatively conclude ""walm"" is an instruction to repeat the previous color, with the number of repetitions equal to the total count of ""walm"" appearances in the sequence so far minus one.",0.8,139,walm

It is important to note that the word ""bluf"" also corresponds to the color red, which is the same as ""wif."" This could either indicate a mistake in the examples or imply that different words can map to the same color.

Given the consistency across examples in which ""dax"" is always mapped to ""green,"" the rule appears to be:

When ""zup"" is paired with other words, each corresponding word is translated into a specific color—e.g., ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""wif"" corresponds to red. 

Hence, the rule seems to be that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, irrespective of the position of ""zup"" in the input string or the presence of other words.

"zup -> yellow

"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""zup"" seems to represent the color yellow each time it is mentioned.

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to examine the relationship between the input strings and the output colors. We can analyze the inputs and corresponding outputs to look for patterns:

- When ""bluf"" is present in the input, we see that ""red"" appears in the output.
- ""bluf"" is always followed by ""red"" in the output excluding the input where ""bluf"" is the last word. In this case, ""bluf"" outputs ""red"" with no subsequent color.
- Each input word appears to correspond to a specific color. For ""lug"" it's ""blue,"" for ""wif"" it's ""red,"" for ""dax"" it's ""green,"" and for ""zup"" it's ""yellow.""
- Notably, the word immediately after ""bluf"" does not appear in the output. Instead, it's replaced by an extra ""red.""

So based on these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" indicates the color ""red"" and also causes the next word's color to be omitted/skipped and replaced by another ""red.""

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> ""red"" and causes the next color to be omitted and replaced with ""red.""",1.0,140,bluf
Rule: bluf -> red,0.0,140,bluf
Rule: bluf -> red,0.0,140,bluf
Rule: bluf -> red,0.0,140,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the presence of the nonce word ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the word prior to ""walm."" To clarify, we can see the following pattern—when ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" the output is green repeated, and when it comes after ""lug,"" the output is blue repeated. 

Here is the reasoning in detail:

- ""dax walm zup lug dax"" results in ""green green green yellow blue green."" Immediately after ""walm,"" we have three greens, which corresponds to the fact that ""dax"" is before ""walm"" and associated with green.
  
- ""lug walm dax"" results in ""blue blue blue green."" The three blues correspond to the word ""lug,"" which comes before ""walm.""

- ""lug walm wif bluf"" results in ""blue blue blue red red."" Again, we have three consecutive blues after ""lug.""

- ""dax zup dax walm"" results in ""green yellow green green green."" Here, we have three greens following the last occurrence of ""dax"" which is just before ""walm.""

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" with blue being the color associated with ""lug.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times in the output sequence.

So the rule is:

- The color corresponding to that word is then repeated three times in the output after ""walm.""

- In the input ""dax lug,"" the output is ""green blue."" Since ""dax"" appears in other examples and is consistently producing ""green,"" we can infer that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the input ""lug,"" the output is just ""blue,"" which supports the previous inference that ""lug"" on its own means ""blue.""
- In the input ""wif dax wif lug wif,"" the output is ""red green red blue red."" We can notice that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and thus ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the input ""zup walm dax lug,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow green blue."" Here, ""zup"" and ""walm"" both correspond to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

- In the second example, ""dax"" precedes the color transition sequences, starting with ""yellow"" following ""green"".

For example, if ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, then ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green."" If ""lug"" corresponds to blue, then ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue"". This rule appears to be consistent with all the given examples.",1.0,141,bluf
"Based on the examples given, ""walm"" appears to trigger a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word that immediately precedes it. In each example, the output is a repeated sequence of the color associated with the word before ""walm"". The quantity of repetition seems to be three times regardless of the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.

Hence, the rule seems to be:
walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Rule: If X is the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""walm"", then ""walm"" means ""X X X"".",1.0,141,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that 'walm' affects the output by repeating the color corresponding to the previous nonce word. Therefore, the rule can be inferred as:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous nonce word. 

For example, in the input ""lug walm"", 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', and 'walm' repeats 'blue' three times. In the input ""wif walm dax"", 'wif' corresponds to 'red', and 'walm' repeats 'red' three times before 'dax' adds 'green'.",1.0,141,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to correspond to the repetition of the last color word mentioned before it. Here is the rationale:

- In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and so ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue.""
- In ""wif walm dax,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""walm"" corresponds to ""red red red"" followed by ""dax,"" which is ""green.""
- In ""dax wif walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""walm"" translates to ""red red red"" preceded by ""dax,"" which is ""green.""
- In ""wif zup lug dax zup walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and hence ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" (three repetitions of the color word right before it).
- In ""zup wif walm,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" therefore ""walm"" corresponds to ""red red red.""

This leads us to the rule that ""walm"" repeats the last mentioned color word three times. 

Rule: walm -> meaning. Repeat the last mentioned color word three times.",1.0,141,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rules:

- Each unique input word (other than ""walm"") is translated to a unique color word (""lug"" to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", ""dax"" to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"").
- The word ""walm"" results in the output color word being repeated based on the position of ""walm"" within the input sequence (one-based index), duplicating the color word that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm"".

Here's how it plays out in the examples:

1. ""lug walm"":
   ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
   ""walm"" is in the second position, so ""blue"" is repeated twice more for a total of ""blue blue blue"".

2. ""wif walm dax"":
   ""wif"" translates to ""red""
   ""walm"" is in the second position, so ""red"" is repeated twice more for a total of ""red red red"".
   ""dax"" translates to ""green"".

3. ""dax wif walm"":
   ""dax"" translates to ""green""
   ""wif"" translates to ""red""
   ""walm"" is in the third position, so ""red"" is repeated twice more for a total of ""red red red"".

4. ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"":
   ""wif"" translates to ""red""
   ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
   ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
   ""dax"" translates to ""green""
   ""zup"" again for ""yellow""
   ""walm"" is in the sixth position, so ""yellow"" is repeated five more times for a total of ""yellow yellow yellow"".

5. ""zup wif walm"":
   ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
   ""wif"" translates to ""red""
   ""walm"" is in the third position, so ""red"" is repeated twice more for a total of ""red red red"".

Therefore, the rule induction for the nonce word ""walm"" can be stated as follows:

walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word in the sequence, a number of times equal to the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence minus one.

Rule: 
For an input sequence of words, if the word ""walm"" is present:
- Find the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"".
- Determine the position of ""walm"" within the sequence.
- Repeat the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" as many times as the position of ""walm"" minus one.",1.0,141,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the patterns before and after ""walm"" in the input and how they relate to the colors in the output.

From the examples:

1. Input: lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue
2. Input: wif walm dax -> Output: red red red green
3. Input: dax wif walm -> Output: green red red red
4. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm -> Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
5. Input: zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red

Based on these examples, whenever the word ""walm"" is present, the output is a series of the same color repeated. The number of repetitions corresponds to the number of words after ""walm"" plus one (which could represent the ""walm"" itself). For example:

- In the first input, there are no words after ""walm"" which results in ""blue blue blue"" (three repetitions of the word ""blue"").
- In the second input, there is one word after ""walm"" which results in ""red red red green"" (three repetitions of ""red"" plus an additional color ""green"").
- In the third input, there are no words after ""walm"" which results in ""red red red"" (three repetitions of ""red"").
- In the fourth input, there are no words after ""walm"" which results in three repetitions of ""yellow"" (and one additional ""yellow"" for the word ""walm"" itself).
- In the fifth input, there are no words after ""walm"" which results in three repetitions of ""red.""

Thus, ""walm"" seems to trigger a repetition of the color word that precedes it (the color word immediately before ""walm"") thrice, followed by the color translation of any word that follows ""walm.""

Rule: ""walm"" -> Meaning is to repeat the color translation of the word before ""walm"" three times, followed by the color translation of any word that appears after ""walm."" If no word follows ""walm,"" just repeat the color of the word before it three times.",0.8,141,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in each example.",1.0,142,lug
"Based on the presented examples, we can deduce a pattern where each input word corresponds to an output color. By comparing the outputs associated with the word ""lug"" in each case, we can discern its meaning. The word ""lug"" consistently results in the output ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the context of the other words.

Therefore, the rule we can induce is:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,142,lug
"Based on the examples provided, lug consistently translates to the output ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule deduced is:

"lug -> blue

"Based on the provided examples, each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output, and these colors are consistent across examples. Here is the breakdown of the word-color associations:

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> blue

In the examples where ""dax"" is present, the color ""green"" is consistently in the output at the same position where ""dax"" is in the input. This is the case regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence or the surrounding words. Therefore, ""dax"" directly translates to the color ""green.""

The rule can be stated as:
dax -> green",1.0,142,dax
"From the examples provided, it seems that individual words are translated to colors consistently, except for the word ""dax."" Each instance of ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green."" However, it's also evident that ""dax"" does not always translate to the same color as the word following it (if any). Instead, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position or the surrounding words.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" appears to be:

Rule: dax -> ""green"".",1.0,142,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" results in the word ""green"" in the output. Additionally, it seems that other words have consistent color outputs as well: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" to ""blue,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"" as well.

Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
- Here, ""wif"" is ""red"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""walm"" is ""blue"", but since ""dax"" is followed by ""zup"" which is yellow, ""dax"" turns the subsequent ""blue"" to ""yellow"", except for itself, which becomes ""green"". 

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- ""lug"" and ""walm"" are both ""blue"". Since ""dax"" is at the beginning, it simply translates to ""green"".

Input: zup wif dax walm
Output: yellow red green green green
- ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""wif"" is ""red"". ""Dax"" occurs before ""walm"", and hence ""walm"" which is normally ""blue"", is turned into ""green"".

Input: lug dax
Output: blue green
- ""lug"" is ""blue"", and since ""dax"" follows it without any word after, ""dax"" is ""green"".

Input: dax wif zup dax
Output: green red yellow green
- ""wif"" is ""red"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"". The first ""dax"" is ""green"". The second ""dax"" is also ""green"", and there are no words after it for ""dax"" to transform its color.

From these examples, it seems that ""dax"" translates directly to ""green"" under any circumstance. If there are words after ""dax"", it does not change their output (as seen by ""lug"" and ""walm"" both being ""blue"" after ""dax,"" and ""zup"" remaining ""yellow"" after ""dax"").

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,142,dax

5. Input: dax wif zup dax

From these examples, it seems that ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

"Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following:

- When ""wif"" appears alone, it outputs a single ""red"" (Example: ""wif"" -> ""red"").
- When ""wif"" precedes another word, it outputs ""red"" followed by the color corresponding to that word (Example: ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue"").
- When ""wif"" is surrounded by other words, it functions the same way, outputting ""red"" for itself and the corresponding color for each following word (Example: ""wif bluf lug zup"" -> ""red red blue yellow"").

From these observations, we can deduce that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

"To determine the meaning of ""bluf"", let's look at the patterns in the examples provided:

2. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
3. lug bluf -> blue blue
4. zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> yellow blue red green green red
5. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green

Now let's analyze these examples to find the rule for ""bluf"":

- In examples 1 and 3, whenever ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", the color ""blue"" is repeated. It seems that ""bluf"" may mean ""repeat the previous color"".
- In example 2, ""bluf"" is followed after ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"", and the output is ""red"" repeated.
- In example 4, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"", the output is ""green"" repeated.
- Example 5 is similar to example 4, reinforcing the idea that ""bluf"" might mean to repeat the preceding color.

So the rule seems to be: ""bluf"" means repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""bluf"".

Rule: bluf -> repeat the previous color.",1.0,142,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns in the given input and output pairs:

Input: lug wif lug bluf Output: blue red blue blue
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Input: zup wif bluf Output: yellow red red
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Input: lug bluf Output: blue blue
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif Output: yellow blue red green green red
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Input: zup dax bluf Output: yellow green green
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

By observing these patterns, it is noticeable that:

- The appearance of ""bluf"" in the input results in a color appearing twice in sequence in the output.
- ""bluf"" comes immediately after a word corresponding to a color in the input, and the corresponding color is repeated in the output.

Given these observations, it can be deduced that ""bluf"" indicates that the color immediately preceding it should be repeated once in the output.

Rule:
bluf -> The color word immediately before ""bluf"" in the input is repeated in the output.",1.0,142,bluf
"bluf -> the color that comes before ""bluf"" is repeated. 

Rule: If a color word is followed by ""bluf"", the output is the same color word repeated.",1.0,142,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. Meaning is ""the color that was just mentioned.""

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" appears after a color word in the input, its output is that same color.",1.0,142,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we'll need to look at the patterns present in the examples and see how the input transforms into the output. Let's examine each example.

1. Input: lug wif lug bluf -> Output: blue red blue blue
2. Input: zup wif bluf -> Output: yellow red red 
3. Input: lug bluf -> Output: blue blue
4. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> Output: yellow blue red green green red
5. Input: zup dax bluf -> Output: yellow green green

We can see that the presence of ""bluf"" in the input causes the output to have one more ""red"" than it would have had based on the other words present when ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""wif."" When ""bluf"" is found at the end of the sequence, its output is the color directly preceding it. Here are the observations based on the examples provided:

- In Example 2, ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""wif,"" and hence it translates to ""red.""
- In Example 3, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and so ""bluf"" also translates to ""blue.""
- In Example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and itself is followed by ""wif."" This situation is similar to Example 2 with ""bluf"" surrounded by ""wif,"" resulting in ""red.""
- In Example 5, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and there are no words after ""bluf,"" which results in the same color as the word before it, ""green.""

From these observations, we can infer the tentative rule for the meaning of ""bluf"":

**Rule**: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" when it is preceded or followed by the word ""wif."" If ""bluf"" is at the end and is not adjacent to the word ""wif,"" then ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word directly preceding it.

Applying this rule, we can state that:

bluf -> ""red"" when next to ""wif""; otherwise, it repeats the color of the previous word.",0.8,142,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to compare the inputs to their associated outputs, focusing on the position and context of ""walm"" within each sequence.

From the examples:

1. dax walm zup lug dax -> green green green yellow blue green
2. zup lug walm wif dax -> yellow blue blue blue red green
3. dax walm wif dax -> green green green red green
4. zup walm dax lug -> yellow yellow yellow green blue
5. zup dax lug walm zup lug -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

We will analyze each instance of ""walm"" and its output. Here is a breakdown of each case:

1. In the first example, the word after ""walm"" is ""zup"" and the corresponding output is green. The position before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" which also translates to green.
2. In the second example, ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" and the associated output is blue—the same color as ""walm"" itself.
3. In the third example, ""wif"" once again follows ""walm,"" and the output is green—the same color as ""walm.""
4. In the fourth example, ""dax"" follows ""walm,"" which gives the output color yellow for both.
5. In the fifth example, ""zup"" follows ""walm,"" and both words yield the color blue.

If we look closely, we can note that in every instance, ""walm"" adopts the color of the word that follows it in the sequence. Let's confirm this pattern with the given examples:

1. green walm green (yellow blue green) – ""walm"" takes the color of the following word, ""zup"" (green).
2. yellow blue blue walm (blue red green) – ""walm"" takes the color of the following word, ""wif"" (blue).
3. green walm (green red green) – ""walm"" takes the color of the following word, ""wif"" (green).
4. yellow walm (yellow green blue) – ""walm"" takes the color of the following word, ""dax"" (yellow).
5. yellow green blue blue walm (blue yellow blue) – ""walm"" takes the color of the following word, ""zup"" (blue).

Based on this analysis, it seems ""walm"" is a chameleon word that changes to match the color of the word following it. So the rule is:

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the word that follows it in the sequence.",1.0,142,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated in the output. Here's the breakdown:

- Example 1: ""dax walm"" results in ""green green"".
- Example 2: ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue"", even though later ""walm wif"" doesn't repeat ""blue"" because ""walm"" only seems to affect the previous word.
- Example 3: ""dax walm"" again results in ""green green"".
- Example 4: ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow"".
- Example 5: ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue"" although it's at the end of the input.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.",1.0,142,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at each input-output pair to see how the presence of ""walm"" affects the color sequences.

1. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" which results in ""green yellow.""

2. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" which results in ""blue blue.""

3. Input: dax walm wif dax
   Output: green green green red green
   Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" which results in ""green red.""

4. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
   Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" which results in ""yellow green.""

5. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   Here, ""walm"" is before ""zup,"" and ""lug"" is duplicated at the end which deviates from the previous patterns seen.

Observing the examples, ""walm"" does not consistently translate to a single output color. Instead, its presence seems to affect the color sequence in a rule-dependent manner. By looking at each instance of ""walm,"" we can see that the color that follows ""walm"" is the same as the color that follows the word immediately succeeding ""walm,"" except when ""walm"" is followed by ""zup.""

Consequently, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word that comes after the next word in the sequence:

- In the first example, ""walm zup lug"" translates to ""green yellow blue,"" and ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" so ""walm"" leads to ""green.""
- In the second example, ""walm wif"" leads to ""blue blue,"" where ""wif"" is followed by ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""walm wif dax"" results in ""green red green,"" where ""wif"" again is followed by ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" followed by ""dax"" results in ""yellow green,"" as ""dax"" captures ""green.""
- In the final example, ""lug walm zup lug"" presents an irregularity, but considering ""lug"" is followed by ""blue,"" it's plausible that ""walm"" should lead to ""blue"" in front of the sequence, but this is not the case.

The rule for ""walm"" does not strictly apply in the last instance, hinting at a possible exception or an inconsistency in the rule's application when ""zup"" follows ""walm."" Due to this exception in the last example, it is more difficult to assign a strict rule to ""walm."" If we dismiss the last example as an outlier or error, the rule for ""walm"" could be understood as:

Rule: ""walm"" makes the color of its output the same as the color associated with the word that follows the next word in the sequence, except when followed by ""zup,"" where the rule may not apply or behaves inconsistently.

Consequently:

walm -> meaning. Meaning is the color associated with the word two places later in the sequence, with a possible exception when followed by ""zup.""",0.8,142,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" induces a change in the output colors, such that the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" is repeated in the output. Here's a breakdown:

1. dax walm zup lug dax 
   - Output before ""walm"": green
   - Output after ""walm"": green repeated, then continues with other colors.

2. zup lug walm wif dax
   - Output before ""walm"": blue
   - Output after ""walm"": blue repeated, then continues with other colors.

3. dax walm wif dax
   - Output before ""walm"": green
   - Output after ""walm"": green repeated, then continues with other colors.

4. zup walm dax lug
   - Output before ""walm"": yellow
   - Output after ""walm"": yellow repeated, then continues with other colors.

5. zup dax lug walm zup lug
   - Output before ""walm"": blue
   - Output after ""walm"": blue repeated, then continues with other colors.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

walm -> Repeat the color output corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"".

Rule: If ""walm"" follows a word 'x', then the color corresponding to word 'x' is repeated once in the output immediately after the output for ""walm"".",0.8,142,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I will examine patterns and correlations between the input and output sentences to deduce the rules that apply to the translation from input to output. First, let's lay out each word from the input next to its corresponding color from the output:

Example 1:
- dax -> green
- walm -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green

Example 2:
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- walm -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green

Example 3:
- dax -> green
- walm -> green
- wif -> red
- dax -> green

Example 4:
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue

Example 5:
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- walm -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

From these examples, ""dax"" consistently translates to green, and ""lug"" consistently translates to blue. ""Zup"" has translated to yellow in the first, fourth, and fifth examples but also appears in the second example where its related color is not mentioned due to the presence of the word ""walm.""

Let's now focus on the occurrences of ""walm"" and the colors associated with it:

- In the first example, ""walm"" is associated with green, which is the color associated with ""dax.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" is associated with blue, the same as ""lug,"" which comes after ""walm.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" precedes ""wif"" but is associated with green, which is the color associated with ""dax.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is associated with yellow, the color of ""zup.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is associated with blue again, following a ""lug.""

It appears that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that either immediately precedes it or follows it. However, there is an exception in the third example where ""walm"" takes the color of ""dax"" even though there are words between them. This may occur because ""dax"" is at both the start and end of the sequence.

Considering the above information, a tentative rule is that ""walm"" takes the color of an adjacent word if possible. In cases where ""dax"" appears multiple times and ""walm"" is surrounded by ""dax,"" it will take the color that ""dax"" represents, which is green. 

However, we also need to account for the fact that ""walm"" does not always take the color of the word immediately prior; in the second and fifth examples, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" but ""walm"" does not take the color of ""lug.""

Given these observations, we can propose the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> takes the color of the following word if it's ""lug"" or the color of ""dax"" if it is the next word after ""walm"" or if it appears multiple times in the sequence with ""walm"" in between.

This aligns with the above observations, fitting most examples provided. However, without a more comprehensive set of examples, this rule may not be perfectly accurate. Further examples would help refine it.",0.7,142,walm

- When ""dax"" is followed before and after by ""zup,"" the output is ""green yellow green yellow.""
- When ""dax"" is at the beginning followed by ""bluf wif,"" the output is ""green green red.""
- When ""dax"" is at the beginning followed by ""lug zup,"" the output is ""green blue yellow.""
- When ""dax"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red green.""

- Other input words such as ""lug,"" ""zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""bluf"" correlate to the colors ""blue,"" ""yellow,"" ""red,"" and another instance of ""green,"" respectively.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" can be stated as follows:

"Considering the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by examining the patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow""

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red

- ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Through these examples, we can consistently see that each time ""wif"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding place in the output. Moreover, the other words (""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""zup walm,"" and ""bluf"") correspond to other colors (""blue,"" ""green,"" and ""yellow""), but the word ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

The color associated with other words also follows a pattern, with ""lug"" always resulting in ""blue,"" ""dax"" always producing ""green,"" and ""bluf"" always mapping to ""red."" The word ""walm"" correlates with a triple ""yellow"" only in the first example, which suggests that it might be an outlier or there are not enough examples to determine a rule for ""walm.""

Considering the consistency of output for the other words, we can deduce a rule for ""wif"":

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,143,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's analyze how its position affects the output and compare it with the other words whose meanings we seem to be able to deduce:

1. lug wif dax zup walm -> blue red green yellow yellow yellow
2. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
3. wif dax bluf -> red green green
4. dax lug bluf wif -> green blue blue red
5. wif lug -> red blue

Let's begin by identifying a pattern for the known words that appear more than once:

- ""lug"" is followed by ""blue"" in every instance.
- ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" in every instance.
- ""bluf"" is always followed by ""red"" or ""green,"" which mimics the color that precedes it.

Now we can focus on ""wif"":

- When ""wif"" comes after ""lug,"" ""dax,"" or ""bluf"" (as in examples 1, 2, and 4), the output color is ""red.""
- Also, whenever ""wif"" is directly followed by another word (examples 1, 2, and 3), the following word takes on the same color as the word that came before ""wif.""

Based on this analysis, we can form the following rule for the word ""wif"":

wif -> when preceding a word, it changes the output to ""red"" and causes the subsequent word to repeat the color that comes before ""wif.""

Rule: When ""wif"" is present in an input, it turns the next color output to ""red"" and also causes the following word (if there is one) to repeat the color that was mentioned before ""wif."" If ""wif"" is at the beginning of the input or directly follows another word, the output is ""red."" If ""wif"" is at the end of the input, it influences the color of the word that precedes it, which will also be ""red.""",0.8,143,wif
"The examples provided indicate that 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow.' Each time 'zup' appears in an input, 'yellow' appears in the corresponding output. There do not seem to be any contextual dependencies that alter the meaning of 'zup' in these examples.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,143,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

The word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in every example provided.",1.0,143,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Each time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. This pattern holds true regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input sentence or the words around it. 

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" is as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,143,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""zup,"" we can analyze the different instances where it appears and the corresponding output:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow"". Since ""bluf"" does not appear in any other input/output pair to independently establish its meaning, we cannot conclusively determine which word relates to ""yellow"" based on this example alone.

- In the second example, ""zup"" appears twice, and each occurrence of ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Other words in the input (""walm dax,"" ""dax wif"") correspond to various colors in the output sequence, but ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" irrespective of its position.

- In the third example, ""zup dax walm"" outputs ""yellow green green green."" Here, ""zup"" is still consistent with the color ""yellow,"" while ""dax walm"" corresponds to three ""green"" in a row, which may imply that ""dax"" and ""walm"" are related to ""green"" in some way, but we need more data to confirm the pattern.

- In the fourth example, ""wif zup"" outputs ""red yellow."" We see here that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" again corresponds to ""yellow.""

- In the fifth example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" as established in previous examples, and ""wif"" to ""red."" ""Dax wif dax zup bluf"" corresponds to ""green red green yellow yellow."" From this, it's clear that ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" as seen in the first example. This reinforces that ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" as all instances of ""zup"" correspond to ""yellow."" However, it's inconclusive whether ""bluf"" also means ""yellow"" or if the repetition in the last word of the input results in a repeated output color.

Analyzing all examples, it is consistent that every instance of the word ""zup"" results in the color ""yellow"" irrespective of the surrounding context. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it. Thus, whenever ""zup"" appears in an input, it translates to ""yellow"" in the output.

zup -> yellow",1.0,143,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence of words.",1.0,143,zup
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns for each corresponding output:

1. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""
2. ""wif bluf dax"" -> ""red red green""
3. ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue""
4. ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow blue yellow yellow""
5. ""lug dax bluf"" -> ""blue green green""

From these patterns, it looks like each word maps to a color, and ""bluf"" seems to take on the color of the word immediately preceding it:

- When ""wif"" (which maps to ""red"") precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is also ""red.""
- When ""lug"" (which maps to ""blue"") precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is also ""blue.""
- When ""dax"" (which maps to ""green"") precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is also ""green.""

Using this information, our rule can be formulated as follows:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word immediately before it in the sequence.",1.0,143,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" changes in meaning depending on the word it follows. Here's what we can deduce from the given examples:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it leads to ""red red green"".
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" it leads to ""blue blue"".
3. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it leads to ""green green"".

Now let's look at the outputs connected to ""bluf"" and ""dax zup lug zup"". The pattern seems to suggest that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it, if that word has been assigned a color. For example, ""lug"" is blue, so ""lug bluf"" gives ""blue blue"", and ""dax"" is green, so ""dax bluf"" gives ""green green"". However, ""zup"" doesn't seem to follow this rule, as ""zup bluf"" doesn't result in ""yellow yellow"" but rather ""yellow"".

Considering this information, the most consistent rule we can induce for the meaning of ""bluf"" is:

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it, except if the preceding word is ""zup"". If ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow"".

Therefore, we can express it as:

bluf -> meaning. ""bluf"" assumes the color output of the word directly preceding it: 
- ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red""
- ""lug bluf"" leads to ""blue""
- ""dax bluf"" leads to ""green""
- ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow"" regardless of the color assigned to ""zup"".",0.9,143,bluf
"Rule: When bluf follows a word, it changes the output's color to the color associated with that word, outputting that color as many times as required by the rules governing the previous words.

For example:
- ""wif"" and ""dax"" yield ""red"" and ""green"" respectively. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif dax,"" it outputs ""red green,"" the colors corresponding to ""wif"" and ""dax,"" and an additional ""green"" because ""dax"" previously yielded a ""green.""
- ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"" because ""lug"" yields ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" following it repeats that color.
- ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" follows previously established rules: ""dax"" gives ""green,"" ""zup"" changes the output to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" gives ""blue,"" and repeating ""zup"" maintains ""yellow."" ""Bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""zup,"" thus ""yellow.""
- ""lug dax bluf"" shows ""lug"" giving ""blue,"" followed by ""dax,"" which changes the next output to ""green."" ""Bluf"" repeats ""green"" because it followed ""dax,"" which yielded ""green.""

bluf -> meaning: Bluf repeats the color output of the word it follows.

Note: The rule slightly deviates from pure repetition with the first example given (""wif bluf dax walm"") in that ""bluf"" outputs a sequence of colors and not just a single repetition, suggesting a more complex set of rules related to the sequence of words preceding ""bluf"" that aren't fully clear with the provided examples.",0.8,143,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be as follows:

- When ""bluf"" is preceded by the word ""wif,"" it translates to ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by the word ""lug,"" it translates to ""blue.""
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by the word ""dax,"" it translates to ""green.""

However, there's an exception in the fourth example, where ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output for ""bluf"" becomes ""yellow,"" which contradicts the established patterns from the other examples. This inconsistency suggests that ""bluf"" may not follow a straightforward rule and there may be more context needed to fully understand its meaning.

Considering this, we may hypothesize that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it, with ""wif"" providing red, ""lug"" providing blue, and ""dax"" providing green, but we must note the irregularity with ""zup"" resulting in a yellow output for ""bluf"" which doesn't match the color associated with ""zup"" in other contexts (seen in the fourth example where ""zup"" alone translates to ""yellow"").

Given the patterns and the irregularities, the best possible rule I can induce with this limited information is:

Rule: ""bluf"" generally reflects the color associated with the word right before it, with specific established associations for ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax"". However, there is an inconsistency when ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" suggesting there may be additional rules or context that alters the color association in this case. Further examples would be needed to clarify the rule for ""bluf"" after ""zup"" or any other preceding words not shown in the given examples.",0.8,143,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that 'bluf' translates to the color ""green"". However, this translation appears to be conditional on the presence of the word 'dax', which also translates to ""green"". When 'bluf' is used without 'dax', it translates to the color of the word that precedes it. Below is the deduced rule:

- When 'bluf' is preceded by or follows 'dax', it means ""green"".
- When 'bluf' directly follows another color word, it takes on the meaning of that word.

So, the rule is:

bluf -> ""green"" when used with or after 'dax', otherwise it takes the color of the preceding word.

Rule: 
If 'bluf' is used with or after 'dax', it means ""green"". If 'bluf' is used after another color word, it adopts the meaning of that color word.",0.8,143,bluf
"walm -> meaning. Meaning is to repeat the color that follows each instance of the word ""walm."" If ""walm"" precedes a color, that color is then repeated three times.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" is followed by a word that represents a color, repeat that color three times in the output. If ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence or isn't followed by a known color term, it results in a repetition of the color specified by the last color term mentioned before ""walm.""",1.0,143,walm
"Observing the patterns in the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. Here's the breakdown:

- In the 1st example, ""lug wif walm lug"" translates to ""blue red red red blue,"" which shows that ""walm"" caused ""red"" to repeat two more times.
- The 2nd example is ""lug walm,"" which translates to ""blue blue blue,"" indicating repetition of ""blue"" associated with ""lug.""
- For the 3rd example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" consistent with repeating the color for ""lug.""
- The 4th example, ""lug walm wif walm,"" becomes ""blue blue blue red red red,"" showing the repetition of ""blue"" after ""lug"" and ""red"" after ""wif.""
- In the 5th example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red,"" indicating a repetition of ""red.""

"From the given examples, we can deduce that the output colors are determined by the input words. Each word seems to correspond to a color, except for ""walm,"" which appears to somehow modify the output. To understand ""walm,"" let's look at the sequences that include it.

- In the first example, the presence of ""walm"" after ""lug wif"" changes the output from an expected sequence of ""blue red"" to ""red red."" Here, ""walm"" seems to cause the color to repeat, but only after changing it.
  
- In the second example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue."" We know ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so it appears ""walm"" is causing the ""blue"" to repeat two more times.

- In the third example, ""lug walm"" again leads to ""blue blue blue."" The pattern of ""walm"" causing the previous color to repeat two additional times is consistent with the second example.

- The fourth example has ""lug walm wif walm,"" resulting in ""blue blue blue red red red."" ""Lug"" is ""blue,"" and the ""walm"" afterward causes ""blue"" to repeat two more times. Then ""wif"" is ""red,"" and the following ""walm"" causes ""red"" to repeat two more times.

- The fifth example shows ""wif walm"" leading to ""red red red,"" which aligns with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red"" and ""walm"" causing it to repeat two additional times.

Rule:
walm -> causes the preceding color to be repeated two additional times.",1.0,143,walm
"walm -> meaning. Meaning can be ""repeat the color corresponding to the previous word"".

Rule: When the word 'walm' is encountered, it indicates that the color of the preceding word must be repeated as output one or more times. The number of repetitions is determined by the number of times 'walm' appears consecutively. For example, if 'walm' is said once, the previous color is repeated once; if 'walm' is said twice in a row, the previous color is repeated twice, and so on.",1.0,143,walm
"Considering the examples provided, it seems that 'walm' repeats the color associated with the word that precedes it two additional times. Below are the laws deduced in relation to 'walm':

1. When 'lug' (blue) is followed by 'walm', the output is ""blue blue blue.""
2. When 'walm' appears after 'wif' (red), the output is ""red red red.""
3. 'dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax' example shows that after 'lug' (blue), 'walm' adds two more 'blue' and continues with the pattern accordingly.
4. In the example 'zup lug walm wif walm,' 'walm' repeats the blue of 'lug' and the red of 'wif' twice.
5. 'wif walm dax zup' shows that after 'wif' (red), 'walm' adds two more 'red'.

From this, we can infer the following rule:

- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue""

- ""walm"" has been observed to correlate with ""blue""

Given these repeated patterns, the rule can be inferred as the following:

- ""zup"" before ""dax"" gives ""yellow green""
- ""lug"" before ""dax"" gives ""blue green""
- ""wif"" before ""dax"" gives ""red green""

Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
- In this case, walm comes after lug and the color for both is blue.

Based on these observations, we can deduce that the word ""walm"" assumes the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Hence, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" takes on the output value (color) of the word directly before it in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> meaning. walm takes the same output color as the preceding word.",1.0,144,walm
"Analyzing the examples and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: zup walm dax

   - ""dax"" leads to ""green""
   
2. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif

   - ""lug"" leads to ""blue""
   - ""zup"" to ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" to ""green""
   - ""wif"" to ""red""

3. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   - ""wif"" leads to ""red""
   - ""dax"" leads to ""green""

4. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   - ""zup"" leads to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" leads to ""red""

5. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   - ""dax"" leads to ""green"" (at the start) then ""blue"" (after ""lug"")
   - ""lug"" leads to a change in behavior for ""dax"" from ""green"" to ""blue""
   - ""zup"" leads to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" leads to ""red""

An inspection of the transitions suggests that ""walm"" copies the color that was indicated by the previous word before ""walm"". 

Rule:
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output for ""walm"" is ""yellow.""
- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output for ""walm"" is ""red.""
- When ""lug"" is in the sequence but not immediately before ""walm,"" the behavior of other words, like ""dax,"" is altered but ""walm"" still copies the preceding word's color.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output for ""walm"" is ""green.""

Based on these observations:

walm -> meaning: The rule for ""walm"" is that it takes on the output color of the preceding word in the sequence.",1.0,144,walm
"Based on the examples provided, walm appears to dictate the color that follows it in the output. To determine this, let's examine the input-output pairs with focus on the position of walm and the color that corresponds to it:

1. In the first example, ""walm dax"" results in ""yellow green."" However, from other examples, we know dax is associated with green. Consequently, ""walm"" independently is associated with yellow this time.
   
2. In the second example, ""walm wif"" leads to ""green green red."" Since wif is associated with red, ""walm"" prior to wif is associated with green this time, potentially indicating a change based on its position or preceding words.

3. In the third example, ""wif walm dax"" converts to ""red red red green."" Here, walm is preceded by wif (which corresponds to red) and is followed by dax (which corresponds to green). ""walm"" itself produces red in the output.

4. In the fourth example, ""zup walm wif"" translates into ""yellow yellow yellow red."" Here, we again see walm is preceded by zup (which corresponds to yellow) and followed by wif (which corresponds to red). ""walm"" mirrors the color yellow, suggesting it takes the color of the word preceding it.

5. In the fifth example, ""lug walm zup wif"" becomes ""blue blue blue blue yellow red."" The walm term follows lug (which is associated with blue) and is followed by zup (which is associated with yellow). Here, walm corresponds to blue, again mirroring the color of the word before it.

Taking these observations into account, we can induce that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. If there's no preceding word (first in the sequence), it seems to default to yellow by observation of the first example (though this pattern is not well established without additional examples).

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the preceding word.
",0.8,144,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that each non-walm word corresponds to a unique color in the output. For instance, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" ""Lug"" appears to correspond to ""blue.""

The word ""walm"" seems to take the color of the next non-walm word in the sequence. For example, in the first sequence (""zup walm dax""), ""walm"" takes the color of ""dax,"" which is ""green."" In the fourth sequence (""zup walm wif""), ""walm"" takes the color of ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

Rule: walm -> Takes the color of the following non-walm word. If it is the last word or followed by another ""walm,"" it defaults to the color of the preceding non-walm word.",0.8,144,walm
"Considering the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, we can try to deduce the pattern by examining the output colors and the position of the nonce word ""walm"" in each input. Let’s look at how ""walm"" is used:

1. ""zup walm dax"" -> Output implies ""walm"" translated to a sequence of ""yellow yellow yellow green"". ""Zup"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to ""yellow."" ""Dax"" follows ""walm"" and corresponds to ""green.""

2. ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" -> When ""walm"" is used here, it translates to a sequence of greens followed by a ""red"". ""Zup"" preceded ""walm"" with ""yellow,"" ""dax"" followed it before with ""green,"" and ""wif"" follows ""walm"" corresponding to ""red.""

3. ""wif walm dax"" -> ""Walm"" leads to the sequence ""red red red green"". ""Wif"" precedes ""walm,"" with an output of ""red,"" and ""dax"" follows it with ""green."" 

4. ""zup walm wif"" -> The appearance of ""walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow red"". ""Zup"" precedes ""walm,"" corresponding to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" follows ""walm"" with ""red.""

5. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" -> Here ""walm"" results in ""blue blue yellow red."" ""Lug"" is directly before ""walm"" with an output of ""blue,"" ""zup"" is directly after ""walm"" with an output of ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" follows, corresponding to ""red.""

From the examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it unless that word is ""dax"" or ""wif,"" where ""dax"" changes the pattern to include ""green"" at the end of the sequence, and ""wif"" changes it to end with ""red"".

Let's consolidate this into a rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it in a sequence. If the preceding word is ""dax,"" the sequence ends with ""green."" If the preceding word is ""wif,"" the sequence ends with ""red."" If any other word precedes ""walm,"" the sequence consists solely of the color corresponding to that word.",0.8,144,walm

"dax -> meaning. The word ""dax"" relates to the color green, as every instance of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to the color green in the output. When ""dax"" is combined with ""wif"" the output consists of two colors: green followed by red. Thus, ""dax"" on its own corresponds to green.

Hence, we deduce that ""dax"" means ""green.""",1.0,145,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

When the input contains only the word ""dax,"" the output is always ""green."" Therefore, we can deduce that the noun ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

When the input is ""dax wif,"" the output is ""green red,"" which suggests that ""wif"" may correspond to ""red,"" but since the rule for ""wif"" has not been asked to deduce, the focus remains solely on ""dax"" being associated with ""green.""",1.0,145,dax
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently maps to the output ""green"" irrespective of whether it is presented alone or with another word (in this case ""wif""). Therefore, when ""dax"" appears by itself, the response is ""green.""

When ""dax"" is paired with ""wif,"" the output is ""green red,"" which suggests that ""wif"" may correspond to ""red,"" as ""dax"" has been consistently associated with ""green.""

Taking this into account, the rules for the correspondence could be stated as follows:

Rule:
- dax -> green
- dax wif -> green red (where ""wif"" is understood to mean ""red"" by its consistent association with the output ""red"")",1.0,145,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can observe the following:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears after ""lug,"" the output is ""red"" following ""blue."" (e.g., ""lug wif"" -> ""blue red"")
- Whenever ""wif"" appears before ""lug,"" the output is ""red"" before ""blue."" (e.g., ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue"")
- When ""wif"" stands alone, it is translated directly to ""red."" (e.g., ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue"")
- ""wif"" can appear more than once and is still translated to ""red"" each time. (e.g., ""lug walm wif zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue red yellow red"")

Thus, we can conclude that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

In every sequence where the word ""wif"" appears, it is followed by a specific color in the output.

- Whenever ""wif"" appears before ""lug,"" the output sequence is ""red blue.""
- Whenever ""lug"" appears before ""wif,"" the output sequence includes ""blue red.""
- When ""wif"" appears after ""zup"" and ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow red"" and ""yellow red red,"" respectively.

Based on this, it seems that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" 

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

wif -> red",1.0,145,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" appears to correspond to a specific color. To determine what that color is, we must look for patterns in the input/output pairs.

- In the first input, “wif” is followed by a color word, and in the output, this corresponds to ""red"" immediately followed by ""yellow."" However, because ""wif"" also appears at the beginning where it is followed by the color ""blue,"" this does not provide a clear rule.
- In the second and fifth inputs, “wif” appears either before or after ""lug,"" and the output is ""red"" followed by ""blue"" or vice versa. This suggests that regardless of position, ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" and ""lug"" to the color ""blue.""
- In the third input, “wif” is followed by ""bluf,"" and in the output, ""red"" is followed by ""yellow."" Since we do not have a standalone example for ""bluf,"" we cannot conclusively determine its meaning, but within this input, ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red.""
- In the fourth input, “lug wif” results in ""blue red,"" further supporting that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Based on these observations, it can be determined that regardless of position or context within the given input strings, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,145,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it can be deduced that the following color mappings exist for the words: ""lug"" correlates with blue, ""zup"" correlates with yellow, and ""bluf"" correlates with red (except when following ""wif"", where it appears to be red on its own).

With this information, it seems that ""wif"" functions as a modifier that inverts the color of the word that follows it. However, there's a discrepancy with ""bluf"" that needs to be noted. In the ""zup bluf wif bluf"" example, ""bluf"" does not turn into blue after ""wif"" but remains red. This discrepancy might indicate either an inconsistency or that ""wif"" works differently with the word ""bluf"". Considering that ""bluf"" means red when following ""wif"", we might deduce that it's treated as an exception and that the ""wif"" inversion rule doesn't apply to it. Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" likely changes the expected output for the color of the word that follows it, with the exception of when the following word is ""bluf"".

However, if we strictly adhere to only consistent observations without taking into account the ""bluf"" exception, there isn't a clear rule for ""wif"". In the case that ""bluf"" is an anomaly, we cannot form a definitive rule based on the information provided. But with available data, one may propose:

- In the first example, 'dax bluf' correlates to 'green green', suggesting that bluf is taking the color of 'dax', which is green.
- In the second example, 'wif bluf' gives 'red red'. Since 'wif' is red, 'bluf' takes on the color red.
- The third example is consistent with the first two examples; 'wif bluf' and 'zup bluf' both times 'bluf' takes on the preceding word's color.
- In the fourth example, 'wif bluf' once again gives us 'blue red', and since 'wif' is blue here, 'bluf' adopts the blue color.

"Based on the examples provided, the following observations can be made:

1. When ""walm"" appears after ""zup"", the output is a repetition of the word ""yellow"", as seen in the first and second examples.
2. Regardless of the position of ""walm"" in the input (whether it's at the end, as in example 3, or in the middle, as in example 4), all words after ""walm"" (including ""walm"" itself) are translated to the color related to the word preceding ""walm"". 
3. The number of times ""walm"" is said in the output is equal to the number of words following ""walm"" in the input plus one for ""walm"" itself. This is observed in examples 1, 3, and 5.
4. In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""lug"", and all words after ""walm"", including ""walm"" itself, are ""blue"", which is the color associated with ""lug"". This further supports observation 2.

"To deduce the meaning or rules associated with the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the provided examples and correlate the inputs with the outputs. 

1. Input: ""zup walm""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to a single ""yellow"" and ""walm"" appears to add two additional ""yellow"" after the ""zup"" color.

2. Input: ""wif zup lug dax zup walm""
   Output: ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" Two instances of ""zup"" produce two ""yellow,"" and then ""walm"" adds two more ""yellow,"" reinforcing the rule observed in example 1.

3. Input: ""lug walm wif zup wif""
   Output: ""blue blue blue red yellow red""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" After ""lug,"" the presence of ""walm"" results in two more instances of ""blue"" before switching to another color, indicating that ""walm"" repeats the color immediately preceding it two more times (a triple of the same color). This adjustment must be reflected since ""walm"" did not repeat ""yellow"" after ""zup"" in this case.

4. Input: ""zup dax walm""
   Output: ""yellow green green green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" After ""dax,"" ""walm"" generates two more instances of ""green,"" reinforcing the modified rule from example 3, where ""walm"" repeats the color immediately before it two additional times.

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color immediately preceding it two more times.

To express this as a general rule:

Rule: If 'x' is a color word that appears immediately before ""walm,"" then ""walm"" causes 'x' to be outputted two more times, for a total of three consecutive instances of 'x'.",0.9,145,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should analyze the consistencies between inputs and outputs, examining how the inclusion of ""walm"" affects the output sequence. The word ""walm"" is consistently translated into a sequence of the word ""yellow"" in the outputs. The number of times ""yellow"" appears in the sequence seems to be dependent on the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence and possibly the presence of other words.

Let's examine the output for each occurrence of ""walm"":

1. Input: ""zup walm"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
2. Input: ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" -> Output: ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow""
3. Input: ""lug walm wif zup wif"" -> Output: ""blue blue blue red yellow red""
4. Input: ""zup dax walm"" -> Output: ""yellow green green green""

What we can infer from the outputs is that ""walm"" generates a sequence of ""yellow,"" but the number of ""yellow"" produced seems to be influenced by one or more factors. Considering ""walm"" is not the last term in any input sequence listed, it's not simply the case that ""walm"" dictates the color of all following terms; rather, the color sequence of ""yellow"" may be influenced by the terms that come before ""walm.""

Looking closer, the sequence of ""yellow"" seems to correspond with the number of terms that follow ""walm."" For example:

- When ""walm"" is followed by 0 terms, the number of ""yellow"" in the output is 3 (""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow"").
- When ""walm"" is followed by 1 term (e.g., ""lug walm wif""), there is one ""yellow"" in the output before the sequence changes color.
- When ""walm"" is followed by 2 terms (e.g., ""zup dax walm""), there are three ""yellow"" in the output before the sequence changes color, but it's worth noting the pattern of green colors that follow up seems consistent: ""green green green"".

However, this last observation disrupts the initial pattern, where the number of following terms directly corresponds to the number of ""yellow"" in the output. Indeed, it might seem to be more related to the positions of ""walm"" within the series of words.

It seems likely that ""walm"" directly produces a single ""yellow"" and has an influence on the number of subsequent ""yellow"" based on the surrounding words. Although it's also possible ""walm"" may simply mean a repetition of ""yellow"" a variable number of times influenced by the position of ""walm"" or the words around it, there isn't a clear rule that governs this within the provided examples.

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to produce the outputs ""red red"" consistently, regardless of the context in which it appears. Hence, ""bluf"" correlates with the output ""red red"". Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: bluf -> red red",1.0,146,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look closely at the sequences and their corresponding outputs. The word ""bluf"" seems to always produce the output ""red.""

Input 1: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
Output 1: green blue blue blue green red red green

- Here, ""bluf"" is followed directly by ""dax"" which is ""green""; ""bluf"" itself is ""red.""

Input 2: wif bluf
Output 2: red red

- The pattern ""wif bluf"" translates respectively to ""red red.""

Input 3: dax bluf wif zup dax
Output 3: green green red yellow green

- Here, ""bluf"" precedes ""wif"" which is ""red"" and follows ""dax"" which is ""green."" Again, ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""

Input 4: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
Output 4: red green red red yellow red

- ""bluf"" comes after two occurrences of ""wif"" and is followed by ""zup""; each ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""bluf"" is again ""red.""

Input 5: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output 5: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

- ""bluf"" is the final word, following ""wif"" which is ""red."" The output for ""bluf"" is ""red"" twice.

From these observations, we can deduce a simple rule:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red,"" regardless of the words that precede or follow it.

Therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" can be stated as:

bluf -> red.",1.0,146,bluf
"Upon analyzing the provided examples and their corresponding outputs, it is clear that each instance of the word ""bluf"" within an input sequence is followed by the output ""red red."" No other provided words result in the output ""red red,"" and the word ""bluf"" consistently produces this same output regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words it is combined with.

Therefore, the rule that can be deduced is:

bluf -> meaning: red red

Rule: Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, the output will be the sequence ""red red.""",1.0,146,bluf
"Reviewing the provided examples:

1. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

2. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

3. Input: dax bluf wif zup dax
   Output: green green red yellow green

4. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
   Output: red green red red yellow red

5. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Based on the examples, we can observe the following potential patterns:

- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
- ""lug"" and ""walm"" possibly translate to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" seems to always translate to ""yellow.""

Focusing on the word ""bluf"":
- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" and its output is ""red red.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" stands alone with ""wif"" as a prefix and translates to ""red.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" and its output is ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup,"" and its output is ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" stands at the end, and the output is ""red red.""

Factoring in the above observations, it appears that ""bluf"" translates to ""red,"" and it causes the color immediately before or after to repeat. When ""bluf"" is at the end or stands alone with ""wif,"" it results in red repeating. Thus, the word ""bluf"" induces repeat of the preceding or following color, which in the context of these examples is always red. 

Rule: bluf -> induces repeat of the preceding or following color; in the examples given, that color is always red.",0.9,146,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to cause the color output sequence to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm."" Here is the rule induction for each input:

- In the first example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times, which is the color associated with ""zup.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and after ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times, which is the color associated with ""lug.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and after ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated three times, which is associated with ""dax.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" and after ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated twice.
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" and after ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated two times.

Thus, the rule seems to be as follows:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.

So the meaning can be articulated as:

walm -> causes repetition of the previous color.",1.0,146,walm
"walm -> meaning. Rule: Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" results in the word after ""walm"" being repeated as its corresponding color in the output. Here is the breakdown:

- In the first input ""dax lug walm zup wif,"" ""zup"" is the word following ""walm,"" hence the output repeats ""blue"" (the color associated with ""zup"") until the sequence changes with ""wif,"" which changes the color to red.
- In the second input ""lug zup walm lug,"" ""lug"" follows ""walm,"" hence the output is ""yellow"" (the color associated with ""lug"") repeated until ""lug"" appears again.
- In the third input ""zup dax walm,"" ""walm"" is the last word, and it has caused the previous color to repeat, which is ""green,"" the color associated with ""dax.""
- In the fourth input ""zup walm wif,"" since ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated as it is the color for ""zup"" until ""wif"" changes the output color to red.
- In the fifth input ""zup walm dax,"" ""dax"" follows ""walm,"" hence the output is ""yellow"" repeatedly until ""dax"" changes the color to green.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the next word to repeat in the output sequence until a different word with a different associated color appears. If ""walm"" is at the end or is not followed by a word, then it causes the color associated with the previous word to repeat.",1.0,146,walm
"Based on the input and output examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" affects the color immediately before it, causing the output color to repeat itself for the position of ""walm"" and any colors that follow until the sequence is interrupted by a new color. Using this pattern, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the output color of the word that precedes it for itself and for the following terms, until a different color word is introduced.

Rule: walm -> repeat the previous color for its position and any following positions until a different color word appears.",0.8,146,walm
"To decipher the meaning of ""walm,"" we can analyze the patterns and changes in output corresponding to its presence and position.

1. The first input contains ""walm"" with ""zup"" before it and ""wif"" after it: green blue blue blue yellow red. We see that ""zup wif"" corresponds to ""yellow red"", and ""dax lug"" corresponds to ""green blue."" Therefore, the presence of ""walm"" here could be creating the pattern blue blue blue.

2. The second input has ""walm"" following ""zup"" and another ""lug"" after it: blue yellow yellow yellow blue. The repeated color ""yellow"" suggests that ""walm"" might be causing repeating the color yellow.

3. The third input is ""zup dax walm,"" and the output is ""yellow green green green."" The presence of a ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in multiple greens.

4. In the fourth example, ""zup walm wif"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow red."" Similarly, ""walm"" here seems to create repetitions of the color yellow.

5. Finally, ""zup walm dax"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow green,"" where again ""walm"" seems associated with the repetition of the color yellow, until a word that triggers another color (in this case, green for ""dax"") appears.

Based on these examples, ""walm"" seems to induce the repetition of the color indicated immediately before it. If no color-directing word follows ""walm,"" the repetition continues until the end of the series or until another color-directing word is encountered.

5. Input: ""dax bluf wif zup dax""

- The presence of ""zup"" does not seem to affect the output of ""dax lug.""
- A repeated ""zup walm"" input yields a repeated ""yellow yellow yellow"" output, indicating consistency in the meaning of ""zup walm.""

Given these observations, the consistent element when ""zup"" is used is the presence of the color ""yellow"" in the output. ""Walm,"" when preceded by ""zup,"" yields three ""yellow,"" whereas ""lug"" preceded by ""zup"" yields one ""yellow"" followed by ""blue.""

Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color blue in every instance it appears in the examples provided.",1.0,147,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" appears to be associated with a repetition of the color word that precedes it. Each time ""walm"" is used, the color word that comes directly before it is repeated multiple times in the output.

For example:
- ""dax lug walm"" leads to ""green blue blue blue"", where ""lug"" (which translates to ""blue"") is repeated three times after it appears once, making four instances of ""blue"" in a row.
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"", where ""zup"" (which translates to ""yellow"") is repeated twice after it appears once, making three instances of ""yellow"" in a row.
- ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" shows that ""dax"" (which translates to ""green"") is repeated four times in a row, followed by the color for ""wif"" (which translates to ""red"").

From this pattern, we can induce that ""walm"" indicates that the color of the word immediately before it is to be repeated three additional times, totalling four consecutive mentions of that color. If ""lug"" means blue, ""lug walm"" would translate to ""blue blue blue blue"".

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""walm"" is as follows:

- ""dax"" again corresponds to green, and the order is preserved, reaffirming that ""lug"" corresponds to blue.

Input: zup lug dax lug

- Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""walm"" seems to add the color ""red"" for each occurrence, so ""wif walm"" and ""lug walm dax"" lead to repetitions of ""red.""

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be that each nonce word directly maps to a particular color. Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" can be inferred as follows:

- In the second example, the word ""lug"" appears before and after ""bluf,"" and since ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and is followed by ""blue,"" it's consistent that ""bluf"" also translates to ""blue.""
- The third example is similar to the second in that ""lug"" is directly translated to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" follows this pattern.
- In the fourth example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" means ""blue.""
- The fifth example also supports the pattern where ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue"" in the output.

Therefore, we can conclude:

"bluf -> blue. Rule: In the given examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.",1.0,148,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns in each example that corresponds to the use of ""bluf"" and its output:

- ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow."" Here, we see that each occurrence of ""bluf"" results in outputting ""blue.""
- ""lug wif lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red blue blue."" The single occurrence of ""bluf"" at the end produces ""blue.""
- ""lug walm wif bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue red red."" The word ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and ""wif"" is followed by ""red."" Since ""bluf"" is last, it produces a ""red.""
- ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue."" The single occurrence of ""bluf"" correlates with the second ""blue.""
- ""wif bluf dax lug"" corresponds to ""red red green blue."" The occurrence of ""bluf"" here follows ""wif"" and is followed by a ""red.""

From these examples, we can induce that ""bluf"" directly correlates with the color ""blue,"" but the example ""lug walm wif bluf"" where ""bluf"" also results in ""red"" causes a contradiction if we consider ""bluf"" to solely mean ""blue."" 

However, considering that ""bluf"" seems to generally correspond to ""blue"" except when it immediately follows ""wif"" which outputs ""red,"" it seems plausible that ""bluf"" does indeed mean ""blue,"" but the presence of ""wif"" directly before ""bluf"" may alter its meaning. Thus, the contradiction could be explained by the word that precedes ""bluf,"" rather than ""bluf"" itself.

Based on the available information:

Rule: ""bluf"" typically means ""blue,"" but when it immediately follows ""wif,"" it means ""red.""

bluf -> ""blue"" or, in the context following ""wif"", ""red.""",0.8,148,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns of the colors associated with each word in the examples provided:

- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red.""
- ""lug"" first corresponds to ""blue,"" and when used with ""walm,"" all outputs are ""blue.""
- ""dax"" first corresponds to ""green,"" and when used with ""walm,"" all outputs are ""green.""

Now, focusing on the word ""walm"" and its effect on the output:

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup wif"" (Input: ""zup wif walm""), the output is ""yellow red red red."" Since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" we might infer that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax wif"" (Input: ""dax wif walm""), the output is ""green red red red."" This supports the previous inference since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" but ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"" is immediately before ""walm,"" causing the repetition of ""red.""
- When ""walm"" is preceded and followed by ""lug"" (Input: ""lug walm dax""), the outputs are ""blue blue blue green."" The presence of ""walm"" between two occurrences of ""lug"" results in ""blue"" being repeated in place of ""walm."" Still consistent with our earlier deduction.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup wif"" again (Input: ""zup wif walm""), we see the same output as the first time: ""yellow red red red,"" reinforcing the idea.
- Finally, when ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug dax"" (Input: ""lug dax walm""), the output is ""blue green green green."" This again aligns with our rule since the color associated with ""dax"" (green) is repeated after ""walm,"" indicating that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color related to the word immediately preceding it.

Given this consistent pattern, we can induce the following rule:

walm -> causes a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.",1.0,148,walm
"Analyzing the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm.""

1. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue

2. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red

3. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

5. Input: lug dax walm
   Output: blue green green green

Let's start by looking at what happens to the color associated with the words surrounding ""walm.""

A. ""zup wif walm lug"" becomes ""yellow red red red blue""
   Here, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" but we have two instances of ""red"" between them due to the presence of ""walm."" The word ""wif"" does not seem to have a direct output translation to a color in the output, which suggests ""walm"" is influencing the output after it.

B. ""dax wif walm"" results in ""green red red red""
   ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and then there are three instances of ""red"" following it. This again suggests ""walm"" is causing the triplication of ""red.""

C. ""lug walm dax"" outputs ""blue blue blue green""
   Here, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""dax"" translates to ""green."" Since we see three ""blue"" before the ""green,"" the presence of ""walm"" appears to be creating repetitions of the color before it.

D. ""zup wif walm"" results in ""yellow red red red""
   This is similar to example A, excluding ""lug."" The result is ""yellow"" followed by three ""red,"" which again indicates ""walm"" leads to triplication of ""red.""

E. ""lug dax walm"" outputs ""blue green green green""
   Here, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and following ""walm,"" there are three instances of ""green.""

After examining each input and associated output, we can notice that ""walm"" results in the triplication of the color that appears after it in the input.

So, the meaning of ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color associated with the word that follows it to appear three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Triplicates the color associated with the following word in the output.",1.0,148,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the consistent patterns:

1. ""lug walm dax"" yields ""blue blue blue green."" ""Lug"" translates to ""blue"" at the start, but with ""walm,"" the output is still ""blue.""
2. ""zup wif walm lug"" yields ""yellow red red red blue."" Without ""walm,"" ""zup wif lug"" would give ""yellow red blue."" With ""walm,"" both ""wif"" and ""lug"" yield ""red.""
3. ""dax wif walm"" yields ""green red red red."" Without ""walm,"" ""dax wif"" would likely yield ""green red."" With ""walm,"" ""wif"" yields ""red.""
4. ""zup wif walm"" yields ""yellow red red red."" Again, without ""walm,"" we would expect ""zup wif"" to give ""yellow red."" With ""walm,"" ""wif"" yields ""red.""
5. ""lug dax walm"" yields ""blue green green green."" Without ""walm,"" we might expect ""lug dax"" to give ""blue green."" With ""walm,"" ""dax"" yields ""green.""

From these patterns, it appears that ""walm"" causes the words that follow it to yield their respective color repeated, except for the final color mentioned, which remains as is. ""Walm"" seems to act as a repeat signal for the color output of words following it, until the last word, which outputs its color normally.

Rule: walm -> causes the following words to repeat their color output until the last word, which outputs normally.",0.8,148,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns in the examples provided. We need to focus on the position of ""walm"" in the input and the corresponding output colors. Let's analyze the inputs and outputs:

1. ""zup wif walm lug"" -> ""yellow red red red blue""
2. ""dax wif walm"" -> ""green red red red""
3. ""lug walm dax"" -> ""blue blue blue green""
4. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
5. ""lug dax walm"" -> ""blue green green green""

Here are the rules we can extract from the examples:

- ""walm"" is always followed by ""red"" in the output, regardless of the color before ""walm"".
- When ""walm"" is at the end of the input string or is followed by a different word than ""lug,"" the following words (if any) in the input do not seem to affect the output—it's always ""red"".
- When ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" the color ""blue"" appears in the output after the sequence of ""red"".

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

walm -> Always changes the following word to red, except if the word after ""walm"" is ""lug,"" in which case it is blue. If ""walm"" is at the end or not followed by ""lug,"" there is no change to colors after the ""red"" sequence.

Rule: ""walm"" turns the following colors into ""red,"" with the exception of ""lug,"" which is turned to ""blue."" If ""walm"" is at the end or is not followed by ""lug,"" it does not affect subsequent colors.",0.8,148,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs:

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue

Here, there are five words in the input and five colors in the output. ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to the first ""red,"" ""walm"" to the second and third ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red

Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to the first ""red,"" and ""walm"" to the next two ""red.""

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green

Here, ""lug"" corresponds to the first ""blue,"" ""walm"" to the next two ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" 

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

Similarly, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to two ""red.""

Input: lug dax walm
Output: blue green green green

Here, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""dax"" is the first ""green,"" and ""walm"" translates to the remaining two ""green.""

Based on the provided input and output, we can deduce the following rule for ""walm"":

"Rule: dax -> green

Analyzing these examples, we can infer that each time the word ‘wif’ is used, the word 'red' follows. We don't have enough context to discern a more complex rule about the nonce word 'wif,' such as its relationship with subsequent or preceding words.

   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" at the start and end.
   - ""zup"" corresponds to the first occurrence of ""yellow"".
   - ""walm"" corresponds to subsequent occurrences of ""yellow"".
   
2. Input: zup lug zup dax
   Output: yellow blue yellow green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to both occurrences of ""yellow"".

   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
   - ""lug"" corresponds to the first ""blue"".
   - ""walm"" corresponds to subsequent occurrences of ""blue"".
   - ""wif"" corresponds to all occurrences of ""red"" after it.

5. Input: wif bluf zup
   Output: red red yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to the double occurrence of ""red"".
   - ""bluf"" seems to be a non-indicative component in this context and should likely be considered as noise.
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

From the examples, we can deduce that irrespective of its position or the order of other nonce words, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"". 

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,149,zup

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" correlates to the color ""yellow."" This conclusion is drawn by observing that wherever ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

To further validate this deduction, let’s look at the examples:

- In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow"" and this occurs twice.
- In the second example, ""zup"" is surrounded by words that map to ""blue"" and ""green,"" but itself maps to ""yellow.""
- The third example shows ""zup"" both preceding and following words that have established colors, and in both places, it maps to ""yellow.""
- The fourth example has ""zup"" at the beginning and again the corresponding color is ""yellow.""
- The fifth example shows ""zup"" at the end of the input sequence followed by ""yellow"" in the output sequence.

There’s a consistent one-to-one match between ""zup"" in the input and ""yellow"" in the output across all examples. Given this, the rule for ""zup"" can be defined as:

"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color that corresponds to the color of the previous word in the sequence. If ""bluf"" is the first word in the sequence or follows a word that has no assigned color, there is not enough information to determine its color.

Examples supporting the rule:

- ""lug wif bluf lug wif"" corresponds to ""blue red red blue red."" Here, the word ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red""; therefore, ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red.""

- ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green""; therefore, ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green.""

- ""zup dax bluf zup dax"" corresponds to ""yellow green green yellow green."" ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green""; therefore, ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green.""

- ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" corresponds to ""blue red green green red blue."" The first ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green""; therefore, ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green.""

- ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red""; therefore, ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red.""

Thus, based on the provided examples:

- In ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" so ""bluf"" also translates to ""green"" as it follows ""dax.""
- Repeating the pattern, wherever ""bluf"" appears, it takes the color of the word just before it.

"Analyzing the pattern between the inputs and outputs, we can observe the following:

1. The word ""walm"" always appears at least once in the input.

2. When it appears, the output has a series of colors that are the same and equal in number to the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.

3. The color that appears in repetition corresponds to the word that precedes ""walm"" in the input sequence. For instance:

   - In the second example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" which corresponds to the color green, and the output is ""green green green green green"". The number of greens corresponds to the position of ""walm"" (the fifth word).

By examining the inputs and outputs, it can be inferred that ""walm"" has a pattern of representing a repetition of the color associated with the previous word in a quantity that matches the position of ""walm"" in the input.

Input: zup lug walm

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to analyze the patterns present in the provided examples. By comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs, we can attempt to determine what ""walm"" signifies in terms of output colors.

Here are the provided examples with their outputs:

1. Input: zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red
2. Input: dax zup dax walm -> Output: green yellow green green green
3. Input: dax walm zup lug dax -> Output: green green green yellow blue green
4. Input: zup walm lug wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
5. Input: zup lug walm -> Output: yellow blue blue blue

Let's analyze the patterns:

- In example 1, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" to red, and then ""walm"" leads to three reds.
- In example 2, ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""walm"" results in three additional greens.
- In example 3, ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""zup"" to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, and ""walm"" within this context leads to two additional greens.
- In example 4, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, ""wif"" to red, and ""walm"" in this position results in two more yellows.
- In example 5, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, and ""walm"" yields two more blues.

Based on the above observations, we can state the following rule for ""walm"":

Walm appears to increase the quantity of the output color that directly precedes it. It duplicates the output color resulting from the word just before ""walm"" in the input sequence. The number of duplications seems to be consistent with the number of letters in ""walm,"" which is four. However, from the given examples, it appears that there is at least one color being output before the duplications commence, indicated by an immediate presence of just one color matching the word right before ""walm.""

So the rule can be stated as:

2. Input: dax zup dax walm -> Output: green yellow green green green
3. Input: dax walm zup lug dax -> Output: green green green yellow blue green
4. Input: zup walm lug wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
5. Input: zup lug walm -> Output: yellow blue blue blue

We notice that every time the word ""walm"" appears, the color immediately preceding ""walm"" is repeated once or more times in the output.

Specifically:

1. ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and ""red"" is repeated thrice.
2. ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and ""green"" is repeated three times (following the first ""green"" which corresponds to ""dax"").
3. ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and ""green"" is repeated twice more.
4. ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and ""yellow"" is repeated twice more.
5. ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and ""blue"" is repeated thrice.

It seems that ""walm"" causes the output color corresponding to the previous word to be repeated an additional number of times. The number of repetitions appears to be equal to the number of times the word 'walm' has been used in the input so far. For example, ""walm"" is used first time in example 1 so red is repeated three extra times (one original plus three additional). In example 2, ""walm"" appears for the second time, so green is repeated four times (one original plus three additional). This pattern holds true for other examples as well.

Based on this, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" in the output n+2 times, where n is the number of times ""walm"" has appeared in the input sequence so far.

Given this rule, ""walm"" signifies a repetition instruction that applies to the word (color) immediately before it, with the number of repetitions increasing with each occurrence of ""walm"".",0.8,149,walm

4. Input: dax walm zup lug dax

5. Input: dax walm zup lug

From these examples, we can observe the following:

- The word ""dax"" always results in the output ""green"", regardless of its position in the input sequence.
- The other words, such as ""wif"", ""lug"", ""zup"", ""walm"", etc., correspond to different colors: ""wif"" -> red, ""lug"" -> blue, ""zup"" -> yellow, ""walm"" -> green.
- The position of ""dax"" relative to these other words alters the sequence order of the colored outputs but doesn't change the fact that ""dax"" translates to ""green"".

Therefore, we can deduce the rule for ""dax"":

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,150,dax
"Analyzing the given input and output pairs, we can make the following observations:

3. Input: dax walm

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" is an instruction to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here's the reasoning:

- In the first example, ""dax walm wif zup"", the output is ""green green green red yellow"". Here ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""walm"" comes right after ""dax,"" resulting in two more ""green""s, followed by the colors for ""wif"" and ""zup,"" which are red and yellow respectively.

- In the second example, ""dax lug walm zup wif"", the output is ""green blue blue blue yellow red"". Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". ""Walm"" comes right after ""lug,"" hence two more ""blue""s, followed by the colors for ""zup"" and ""wif"", which are yellow and red.

- In the third example, ""dax walm"", we see ""green green green"" which reinforces the pattern that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it, as ""dax"" is associated with ""green.""

- In the fourth example, ""zup walm"", the output is ""yellow yellow yellow."" Here ""zup"" is established to be associated with ""yellow"", and given ""walm"" comes right after, it results in repeating the color ""yellow"" twice.

- The fifth example, ""dax walm"", repeats the same pattern and matching colors from the third example, reaffirming the function of ""walm.""

In the first and third examples, ""walm"" comes after the word ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green green."" In the second example, ""walm"" is not immediately after ""dax,"" but is still part of a sequence that includes ""dax,"" and the output includes multiple instances of ""blue"" and ""green."" In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow."" From these observations, we can attempt a rule for ""walm"":

Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word that precedes it. For example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""dax walm"" yields ""green green green."" Similarly, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""zup walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow.""

"Rule: zup -> ""yellow""

Justification:
Each time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output. This remains consistent regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence or the other words present. Therefore, it suggests that ""zup"" translates directly to ""yellow"".

- ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow"" (since ""lug"" has consistently corresponded to ""blue"" in other examples).
- ""dax zup wif"" translates to ""green yellow red"", with ""dax"" corresponding to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red"".
- ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow blue yellow yellow"", indicating that ""bluf"" likely corresponds to just ""yellow"", and ""zup"" maintains its translation as ""yellow"".
- ""lug dax zup"" translates to ""blue green yellow"", maintaining the consistency for ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup"".
- ""wif walm zup walm"" translates to ""red red red yellow yellow yellow"", indicating ""walm"" may add a repetition of the previous color and ""zup"" adds ""yellow"".

Rule: bluf -> blue.",1.0,151,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule for the word ""bluf"" is:

Rule: bluf means blue.",1.0,151,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the given examples:

1. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow

   Output: green yellow yellow
   
3. Input: lug bluf wif

4. Input: lug bluf dax lug
   Output: blue blue green blue
   
5. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red

We'll focus on recognizing the patterns associated with ""bluf"" in different contexts:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is between ""wif"" and ""lug"" and the corresponding colors are ""red"" and ""blue."" This suggests that ""bluf"" might be related to ""blue,"" considering the surrounding words' colors.

- In the second example, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" both corresponding to ""yellow."" So, ""bluf"" could indicate a repetition of the previous color.

- In the third example, ""bluf"" precedes ""wif"" and the colors are ""blue"" and ""red."" This again supports the notion that ""bluf"" might be repeating the previous color.

- The fourth example repeats ""lug"" before and after ""bluf,"" and all are ""blue,"" suggesting ""bluf"" doesn't change the previously established color.

- For the fifth example, ""bluf"" is after ""wif"" and both are ""red,"" reinforcing the repetition idea.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word/color, except when following ""wif,"" which is always ""red."" When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the color output is ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word/color, except when the preceding word is ""wif"", then it's ""red"".",0.8,151,bluf
"By examining the outputs corresponding to every instance of the word ""bluf,"" we can determine the rule:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" results in ""blue,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" could directly translate to ""blue.""
- In the second example, it might not be immediately clear, since ""bluf"" results in ""yellow."" However, if we consider that ""bluf"" is followed by a word (""zup"") that also translates to ""yellow,"" it could suggest that ""bluf"" takes the color immediately following it.
- The third example supports this, as ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" which translates to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" also yields ""blue."" We do not have a conflict here because ""bluf"" appeared before the determining word, but it did not change its own output.
- The fourth example supports the initial assumption that ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" because it yields ""blue"" even when different words follow it.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" and both ""bluf"" and ""wif"" yield ""red."" However, the repeatability of the color ""blue"" in the sequence, as well as two instances of ""red"" at the end, might suggest that ""bluf"" could potentially reinforce or duplicate the color ""blue"" before changing to the next identified color, ""red.""

Considering these observations, the most consistent rule that can be deduced is:

bluf -> ""blue""

This interpretation is supported by the reoccurrence of ""blue"" each time ""bluf"" appears, regardless of the surrounding context. The instances where ""bluf"" is followed by a different color seem to be a result of another rule affecting the color sequence rather than changing the meaning of ""bluf"" itself. So the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue.""",0.8,151,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""walm"" results in the output color being repeated three times in secession. To validate this, let's analyze each example.

1. For ""wif walm zup walm"", the output is ""red red red yellow yellow yellow"". 
   - ""wif"" translates to a single ""red"".
   - Following ""walm"", there are three ""red"" which suggests that ""walm"" is related to the previous word, ""wif"", being repeated three times.
   - ""zup"" then translates to a single ""yellow"".
   - Following the second ""walm"", we again see ""yellow"" being repeated three times.

2. For ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"", the output is ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red"".
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", ""lug"" to ""blue"".
   - After ""zup walm"", ""yellow"" is repeated three times, as with the first example.
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green"", followed by ""wif"" which translates into ""red"" twice.

3. ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green"".
   - The word ""dax"" correlates with ""green"".
   - After ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated three times.

4. ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red"".
   - The word ""wif"" correlates with ""red"".
   - After ""walm"", ""red"" is repeated three times, as before.

5. ""dax walm wif"" outputs ""green green green red"".
   - As before, ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" and is repeated three times after ""walm"".
   - ""wif"" is separate and correlates with a single ""red"".

If we consider ""walm"" to act on the word that precedes it, causing the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times, the evidence from the examples provided supports this rule.

- walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",1.0,151,walm
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word three times.,1.0,151,walm
"Analyzing the examples provided, it seems that the number of times the color is repeated in the output corresponds to the number of output colors for the preceding word. Let's break it down:

1. ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red"", suggesting that ""walm"" requires the previous word's color output to be repeated three times.
2. ""zup lug zup walm"" leads to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"", following the same logic, the word before ""walm"", which is ""zup"" (yellow), is repeated three times.
3. ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green"", again the color before ""walm"" (green) is repeated thrice.
4. ""wif walm"" gives us ""red red red"", consistent with the other examples, where the color red is repeated three times after ""wif"".
5. ""dax walm wif"" results in ""green green green red""; ""green"" is the color associated with ""dax"", and it's repeated three times before ""wif"" changes the color to ""red""

From these examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" signals the repetition of the previous color three times.

Rule: walm -> The previous color is repeated three times.",1.0,151,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word walm corresponds to a repeated word pattern that is dependent on the word that precedes it. Analyzing the inputs and the corresponding outputs:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green,"" indicating the word ""dax"" relates to the color green, and ""walm"" repeats this color three times.

There is no example with ""lug"" preceding ""walm,"" but by analyzing the colors, it seems that each color word is repeated twice except when followed by ""walm"" where it's repeated thrice, highlighted by the example of ""zup,"" which produces two yellows or three when followed by ""walm.""

The rule seems to be: ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to be repeated three times instead of twice (as would be the case if ""walm"" were not there).

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding word's color to be repeated three times.",0.9,151,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to find a pattern between the example inputs and their corresponding outputs. Let's examine each input/output pair:

- The color that is repeated three times changes depending on the word that precedes ""walm.""
- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is three reds.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is three greens.

Based on this analysis, the rule for ""walm"" could be that it triggers a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, and that repetition is threefold.

"Given the examples provided, we can observe that ""lug"" consistently maps to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words that surround it. Here are the observations for each input/output pair:

- ""zup lug dax lug"" -> ""yellow blue green blue"": ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" in two positions.
- ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue"": ""lug"" appears once and translates to ""blue"".
- ""lug zup wif lug"" -> ""blue yellow red blue"": ""lug"" appears at the beginning and end, translating to ""blue"" each time.
- ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue"": This is identical to a previous example, confirming ""lug"" as ""blue"".

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" is associated with the color green, regardless of its position in the sentence or the context. Every time ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output. Therefore, we can deduce a rule for the meaning of ""dax"":

"By analyzing the examples provided, the following patterns are observed:

- In every input-output pair, the term ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green.""
- All other words either correspond to a specific color or change the output color depending on their position or context.

For instance:
- The word ""zup"" always results in ""yellow"" when used in the output.
- The word ""bluf"" results in ""green,"" and when it follows ""dax,"" it retains the same color output.
- The word ""lug"" leads to ""blue"" except when it precedes ""dax,"" in which case ""dax"" takes precedence and the output is ""green"" immediately following ""lug.""
- The sequence ""wif walm"" together corresponds to ""red red,"" but when not together, their output may differ.

Rule: 
dax -> green

This rule signifies that in all cases analyzed, the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output regardless of its position or context.

"Rule: bluf -> repeated color of the previous word. 

This rule is inferred because in each instance bluf copies the color associated with the word immediately before it.

In another example, ""lug wif bluf lug wif"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue, followed by ""bluf"" which also corresponds to blue.",1.0,152,bluf
"From the given examples, we can infer that 'bluf' corresponds to a noun with a variable component, potentially dependent on what precedes it. In each example, 'bluf' takes on the value of the color that comes before it:

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" means ""red"" when it follows the word ""wif,"" but when it precedes ""wif,"" it means ""green."" Additionally, ""bluf"" means ""yellow"" when it follows the word ""zup."" It does not follow a particular word in the third input, but based on the output, ""bluf"" results in two instances of ""red,"" suggesting that perhaps ""bluf"" can duplicate the color that precedes it, although this does not hold when considering the other examples.

To summarize the apparent rules for ""bluf"" based on the examples:

1. Following ""wif"" -> ""red""
2. Preceding ""wif"" -> ""green""
3. Following ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
4. The duplication rule seems inconsistent with given examples and should be disregarded.

However, since the duplication rule does not fit all examples and the word ""bluf"" did not always follow or precede the same word, the previous observations may not represent the complete set of rules for ""bluf."" It's worth noting that without more examples, especially with varied positions of ""bluf"" relative to other words or contexts, the rules deduced may not be exhaustive or definitive.

Rule:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it translates to ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" comes before ""wif,"" it translates to ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it translates to ""yellow.""

That said, the rule for ""bluf"" without context is not clear from the given examples. Additional context or examples would be needed to fully ascertain its meaning.

For now, one potential rule induction is:

bluf -> ""red"" following ""wif,"" ""green"" preceding ""wif,"" or ""yellow"" following ""zup.""",0.8,152,bluf
Rule: bluf -> red,0.0,152,bluf
"Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word.

Explanation: In all the examples, the color sequence for ""walm"" is a repetition of the color assigned to the previous word.

- Example 1: dax walm wif zup. Since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""walm"" here also corresponds to ""green"".
- Example 2: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf. Here ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"", so ""walm"" also gives ""yellow"".
- Example 3: lug zup walm lug. ""Walm"" follows ""zup"" with ""yellow"", hence ""walm"" also corresponds to ""yellow"".
- Example 4: zup walm. ""Walm"" directly follows ""zup"", which is ""yellow"", thus ""walm"" equals ""yellow"".
- Example 5: zup wif walm. ""Walm"" follows ""wif"", which is ""red"", so ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"".

Therefore: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word.",1.0,152,walm
"Analyzing the examples provided alongside their outputs, let us deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm.""

1. In every instance where ""walm"" appears, it is followed by the output ""yellow yellow yellow.""
2. The sequence of ""yellow yellow yellow"" does not appear unless ""walm"" precedes it.
3. No other input word (like ""dax,"" ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" or ""bluf"") is consistently followed by the sequence ""yellow yellow yellow.""
4. The output ""yellow yellow yellow"" is invariant, meaning it does not change based on the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence or the other words around it.

Therefore, it seems that the rule for the word ""walm"" is as follows:

walm -> meaning: The word ""walm"" directly translates to the output ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in the input, output three consecutive ""yellow"" regardless of its position or surrounding words.",1.0,152,walm
"Rule: walm means repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. 

For example:
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green"" because ""dax"" translates to green, and ""walm"" repeats that color.
- In ""zup walm"", ""zup"" is yellow, so ""walm"" also translates to yellow.
- In ""zup wif walm"", ""wif"" is red, so ""walm"" results in red being repeated.

Therefore, walm -> repeat the color of the previous word.",1.0,152,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's compare the input sentences with their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow

2. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

3. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

By examining the inputs and outputs, a potential pattern emerges:

- In all the cases where ""walm"" is present, the output color following ""walm"" is yellow. 
- ""walm"" does not seem to change the output color for any words that come before it in the sequence.
- ""walm"" consistently precedes a yellow, regardless of the word that comes after it.

Based on this pattern, the rule appears to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in the input, the output color right after ""walm"" is yellow, independent of the word following it.

Therefore:
walm -> meaning. Meaning: The output color following the word ""walm"" is yellow.",0.8,152,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the patterns in both the input and output strings and see how ""walm"" affects the output. Let's examine each input and respective output in turn:

1. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow

In this case, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to the second ""green"" in the output. Since only ""walm"" is followed by three ""green"" and the only other element followed by ""green"" is ""dax,"" there might be a connection between ""walm"" and ""dax"" in terms of output color. 

2. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Here, ""walm"" follows the second ""zup,"" and both times ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow"" in the output. ""walm"" also precedes ""dax,"" which is followed by ""green,"" but since ""walm"" is in the middle, it's not immediately clear if it affects the color output of following words.

3. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

""walm"" follows ""zup"" again and the output is yellow like before.

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

Again, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" with the output consistently being yellow.

5. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

In this final example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output for ""wif"" is ""red."" 

In all cases, the presence of ""walm"" seems to correspond with multiple occurrences of the same color that follows the word preceding ""walm."" Specifically, ""walm"" appears to extend the color of the word before it in the sequence repetitively.

Given this pattern, the rule for ""walm"" could be: it repeats the color output of the word preceding it until either a new word appears or there are three repeats.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word's output up to three times, or until a new word appears.

For example:
- After ""dax"" (green), ""walm"" produces ""green green green.""
- After ""zup"" (yellow), ""walm"" produces ""yellow yellow,"" and when ""walm"" is at the end it produces ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- After ""wif"" (red), ""walm"" produces ""red red red.""",0.8,152,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Each time the word ""lug"" is used in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,153,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue,"" regardless of its position or the context within the given examples.",1.0,153,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,153,lug
"Rule: ""lug"" -> blue

Evidence supporting the rule:
- In every example where the word ""lug"" appears, the output always includes the color blue.
- ""lug"" appears to be a consistently mapped to blue, regardless of its position in a sequence or the presence of other words.",1.0,153,lug
"Using the examples provided, we can try to deduce the rule that applies to the nonce word ""lug.""

In each output sequence, every instance of the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" There doesn't seem to be any additional context or variations in the use of ""lug"" that would change its associated color in these examples. 

Thus, the rule is straightforward:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,153,lug
"To figure out the meaning of ""dax,"" let's draw assumptions from the data provided. Here's what we know:

1. When ""wif"" appears before ""dax,"" the output is ""red green.""
2. When ""zup"" appears before ""dax,"" the output is ""yellow green.""
3. When ""dax"" appears before ""zup,"" the output for ""dax"" remains ""green.""
4. When ""dax"" appears before ""wif,"" the output for ""dax"" remains ""green.""
5. ""dax"" always results in ""green,"" regardless of its position or the words surrounding it.

From the examples given, it appears that the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence and the adjacent words.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,153,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine how its presence affects the output in each example:

1. ""wif dax wif"" corresponds to ""red green red."" The word ""wif"" translates to ""red"" both times it appears, and ""dax"" appears once, translating to ""green.""

2. ""zup dax bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow green green."" Here, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" also translates to ""green.""

3. ""zup dax lug walm zup"" corresponds to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow."" In this example, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" at both ends, ""dax"" translates to ""green"" as previously seen, ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" to ""blue"" as well since it is followed by more ""blue.""

4. ""dax zup lug wif zup"" corresponds to ""green yellow blue red yellow."" In this example, ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" while the other words ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif"" correspond to the colors ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" and ""red"" respectively.

5. ""wif zup walm dax zup"" corresponds to ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow."" Here, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" to ""yellow,"" while ""dax"" appears again as ""green.""

The word ""dax"" consistently results in ""green"" regardless of the position or surrounding words.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,153,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" translates to the color ""green."" However, the other words seem to transform based on their position or the context they are in. To confirm this, let's examine the occurrences of ""dax"":

1. wif dax wif -> red green red
2. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
3. zup dax lug walm zup -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow
4. dax zup lug wif zup -> green yellow blue red yellow
5. wif zup walm dax zup -> red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

In each instance where ""dax"" appears, regardless of its position or surrounding words, the output is always ""green."" While the translation of other words seems context-dependent, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,153,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: In each example, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,153,dax
"Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green."" 

Evidence supporting this rule comes from the consistent output of ""green"" following the input of ""dax"" across all examples. Other words also consistently translate to specific colors: ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" also to ""blue."" The word ""dax"" does not affect the colors of the words around it, unlike ""wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug,"" which determine the output color for ""walm.""

Therefore, we can deduce the rule as follows:
dax -> green",1.0,153,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output.

Therefore, the rule is: wif -> red",1.0,153,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following patterns:

- Whenever ""wif"" is present, the output always contains ""red.""
- ""wif"" appears to be independent of its position in the input sequence.

Let's examine each example:

1. Input: wif dax -> Output: red green
   Here ""wif"" comes before ""dax"" and the output for ""wif"" is ""red.""

2. Input: zup walm wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   Here ""wif"" is the last word, but the output is still ""red.""

3. Input: wif -> Output: red
   Here ""wif"" is on its own and the output is ""red.""

4. Input: lug walm zup wif -> Output: blue blue blue yellow red
   Again, ""wif"" is the last word and the output corresponding to ""wif"" is ""red.""

5. Input: dax lug wif lug -> Output: green blue red blue
   ""wif"" is in the middle this time and still, the output for ""wif"" is ""red.""

Given these observations, the rule appears to be that ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red"" no matter where it occurs in the sequence. Therefore:

"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color mentioned immediately before it. Here's the rationale:

- In the first example, after ""lug"" which corresponds to the color blue, ""bluf"" results in the color yellow, the color mentioned immediately before ""lug"". So ""bluf"" takes the color of the word before it, which is ""zup"" meaning yellow.
- In the second example, the only color mentioned before ""bluf"" is red, and ""bluf"" results in red as well.
- In the third example, ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow is followed by ""bluf"" resulting in yellow again.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" is red, and ""bluf"" follows with red again, then ""zup"" is yellow and follows ""bluf"".
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" which corresponds to blue is followed by ""bluf"" resulting in blue, then ""wif"" corresponds to red.

This pattern suggests the rule that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word mentioned immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the previous word.",1.0,153,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" takes the color value of the word that immediately precedes it. Here are the relations observed:

- When ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"" is followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""red red"".
- When ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"" is followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""blue blue"".

Given this pattern, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it replicates the color value of the word that comes before it.

Rule: bluf -> The same color as the preceding word.",1.0,153,bluf
"Observing the patterns in the examples provided:

1. When 'bluf' follows a word, the output color matches the color of the word that comes immediately before 'bluf'. For example:
   - In ""dax zup lug zup bluf,"" the word 'zup' precedes 'bluf' and the corresponding color for 'zup' is 'yellow'. Thus, the output for 'bluf' is also 'yellow'.
   - In ""wif bluf,"" the word 'wif' precedes 'bluf' and the corresponding color for 'wif' is 'red'. Hence, the output for 'bluf' is 'red'.
   - In ""lug bluf wif,"" the word 'lug' precedes 'bluf' and the corresponding color for 'lug' is 'blue'. Therefore, the output for 'bluf' is 'blue'.

2. When 'bluf' is the first word, there is no prior example to determine the behavior. However, since no such example is given, this situation can be disregarded for rule formation.

Based on these observations, the rule for 'bluf' can be stated as follows:

Rule: bluf -> the color word that comes immediately before 'bluf' in the input sequence.",1.0,153,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word 'bluf' takes on the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. 

Here's the reasoning:

- In the first line, 'zup' precedes 'bluf' and the output for both 'zup' and 'bluf' is 'yellow'.
- In the second line, 'wif' precedes 'bluf' and the output for both is 'red'.
- In the third line, we see the same rule apply with 'zup' and 'bluf' producing 'yellow'.
- In the fourth line, the rule holds with 'wif' and 'bluf' both mapping to 'red', and then 'zup' mapping to 'yellow'.
- Finally, in the fifth line, 'lug' precedes 'bluf' and both output 'blue', followed by 'wif' mapping to 'red'.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:
bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the color associated with the preceding word. Rule: The word ""bluf"" adopts the color of the word that comes immediately before it.",1.0,153,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we'll analyze how the output changes in the presence of this word within the provided examples. Let's look at each input and the corresponding output step by step.

1. Input: zup walm lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue

With ""zup"" correlating to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" correlating to ""blue,"" the word ""walm"" in between the repetitions of ""yellow"" suggests that ""walm"" also translates to ""yellow.""

2. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

Here, we see ""wif"" translates to ""red."" ""Zup"" continues to translate to ""yellow,"" but now we have two ""yellow"" at the end corresponding to ""zup"" and ""walm,"" reinforcing that ""walm"" might indeed mean ""yellow.""

3. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

Again ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and with the input ending with ""walm"" and the output ending with ""red,"" it suggests that ""walm"" could mean ""red"" in this context. However, this conflicts with previous examples.

4. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red

Here ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""red,"" and since ""walm"" and ""dax"" precede three occurrences of ""green,"" ""walm"" could mean ""green"" in this context. But again, this conflicts with the idea that ""walm"" means ""yellow.""

5. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red

This reinforces the correlation of ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""wif"" with ""red."" Since ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes two additional ""green"" in the output, it could imply ""walm"" means ""green"" here.

By comparing all examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" does not have a fixed color associated with it. Instead, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word that precedes it. 

So, based on the analysis:

Rule: ""walm"" assumes the color of the word immediately before it.",1.0,153,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the outputs against the corresponding inputs where ""walm"" is present:

1. ""zup walm lug"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" Since ""zup"" is present twice and we see ""yellow"" twice, we can infer that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" Similarly, ""lug"" seems to correlate with ""blue."" The third ""yellow"" must then correspond to ""walm,"" suggesting ""walm"" could mean ""yellow.""

2. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" translates to ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow."" We already know ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" ""Wif,"" being followed by ""red,"" appears to translate to ""red."" Since the last three ""yellow"" colors follow ""zup walm"" without the presence of ""lug,"" ""walm"" seems to be reaffirmed as ""yellow.""

3. ""zup wif walm"" results in ""yellow red red red."" Again, ""zup"" coincides with the first ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" with the first ""red."" The presence of two additional ""red"" after ""walm"" might lead to confusion, but looking at previous conclusions, the repetitive nature after ""walm"" might suggest that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color that comes immediately before it.

4. ""dax walm wif bluf"" leads to ""green green green red red."" Since ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" and ""walm"" by two additional ""green,"" it strengthens the idea that ""walm"" might be causing the repetition of the preceding color. Additionally, ""wif"" preceding ""red"" confirms ""wif"" as ""red,"" and ""bluf,"" since it's not repeated, is associated with one ""red.""

5. ""zup dax walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow green green green blue red."" ""Zup"" yields ""yellow,"" ""dax"" yields ""green,"" ""lug"" yields ""blue,"" and ""wif"" yields ""red."" The occurrence of ""walm"" results in the repetition of ""green"" which came just before it.

From these examples, it is apparent that ""walm"" causes repetition of the color immediately preceding it in the input, up to three times in total (for the color already there plus two more times for the color word ""walm"").

Rule: walm -> Causes the repetition of the color word immediately before it, up to three times in total.",0.9,153,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in each input and output pair.

- When ""walm"" appears, a sequence of the same color follows.
- The sequence of the same color is dependent on the other words present with ""walm"".

Now let's break down each example to identify the rule:

1. ""zup walm lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue"". 
   - ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and leads to ""yellow"".
   - The ""lug"" after ""walm"" turns to ""blue"".
   - ""walm"" causes multiples of the color before it, hence three ""yellow"".

2. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" translates to ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"".
   - ""zup"" again precedes ""walm"" and generates a ""yellow"".
   - ""walm"" causes triples of this color since it is the third color.

3. ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red"".
   - ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" translating to ""red"".
   - ""walm"" causes triples of ""red"" since it's following ""wif"".

4. ""dax walm wif bluf"" translates to ""green green green red red"".
   - ""dax"" before ""walm"" results in ""green"".
   - ""walm"" results in triples of ""green"" since it's after ""dax"".
   - ""wif"" follows ""walm"" and translates to ""red"".

5. ""zup dax walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow green green green blue red"".
   - ""dax"" before ""walm"" and it results in ""green"".
   - ""walm"" again causes triples of ""green"" since it's following ""dax"".
   - ""lug"" after ""walm"" translates to ""blue"", and ""wif"" at the end translates to ""red"".

Based on the above analysis, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.",0.9,153,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should compare the input sentences to their outputs and look for patterns associated specifically with the word ""walm.""

In the first input, ""zup walm lug"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" We can safely assume ""zup"" means ""yellow"" as it always precedes a ""yellow"" in the output and ""lug"" means ""blue"" since it corresponds to the color ""blue"" at the end of the sequence. The occurrence of ""walm"" correlates with three ""yellow,"" suggesting a repetition based on something prior in the sequence.

In the second input, ""zup wif lug zup walm,"" we know that ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" ""lug"" means ""blue,"" and it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" as it precedes it in the output. After a second ""zup,"" ""walm"" results in three ""yellow"" again, following a pattern of repetition.

The third input, ""zup wif walm,"" gives us ""yellow red red red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" has resulted in the repetition of ""red,"" which only happens to be the directly preceding color.

In the fourth input ""dax walm wif bluf,"" we notice ""dax"" is followed by the color ""green,"" and ""walm"" then results in two additional ""green"" before ""wif"" leads to two ""red.""

The last input, ""zup dax walm lug wif,"" shows that after ""zup"" (yellow) and ""dax"" (green), ""walm"" leads to two more ""green,"" followed by ""lug"" (blue) and ""wif"" (red). 

Based on the inputs and their corresponding outputs, it seems the rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color of the last unique word preceding it three times. 

Therefore, the rule is:

walm -> Repeat the color of the last unique color word three times.

For example, if the last color word before ""walm"" was ""zup,"" which means ""yellow,"" then ""walm"" would result in ""yellow yellow yellow."" If the last color word was ""dax,"" which means ""green,"" then ""walm"" would result in ""green green green,"" and so on.",0.9,153,walm
"Observing the outputs corresponding to the presence of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can notice a pattern:

Input: zup wif lug zup walm
Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
- 'zup' corresponds to yellow
- 'wif' corresponds to red
- 'lug' corresponds to blue
- Again, the presence of 'walm' resulted in repeated 'yellow' after 'zup'

Input: zup wif walm

- 'zup' corresponds to yellow
- 'wif' corresponds to red
- The presence of 'walm' turned the output to repeated 'red' after 'wif'

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red
- 'dax' corresponds to green
- 'wif' corresponds to red
- 'bluf' was not seen in the input, but it corresponds to red in the output
- 'walm' caused the output to repeat the color corresponding to 'dax' (green) thrice, before 'wif'

Input: zup dax walm lug wif
Output: yellow green green green blue red
- 'zup' corresponds to yellow
- 'dax' corresponds to green

"Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" causes the next word to be repeated in terms of the output color.

Explanation:

- ""zup walm dax"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow green,"" where ""yellow"" is repeated three times before we see a new output color ""green"" for ""dax.""
- ""lug walm wif lug"" outputs ""blue blue blue red blue,"" with ""blue"" repeated three times before ""red"" which corresponds to ""wif,"" and once more ""blue"" for the second ""lug.""
- ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green,"" and ""dax"" is linked to the color green, which is repeated three times.
- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow,"" with ""zup"" linked to yellow, which is repeated three times.
- ""lug walm zup"" outputs ""blue blue blue yellow,"" with ""blue"" repeated three times for ""lug"" and then ""yellow"" for ""zup.""

So, walm -> causes the next word to be repeated in output color.",1.0,154,walm
"walm -> replicate the color of the word that precedes it

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, the color that corresponds to the preceding word is repeated the number of times specified by the word followed by ""walm"". For example:

- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and the output is three instances of blue.",1.0,154,walm
"walm -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: In each provided input, the word ""lug"" consistently maps to the color ""blue"" in the corresponding output.",1.0,155,lug
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

- In the first example, ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" which yields the output ""blue blue."" This suggests that ""lug"" might translate to ""blue"" since it produces two blues in a row, possibly because ""walm"" is adjacent to ""lug.""
  
- In the second example, ""lug"" appears after ""wif"" and before ""walm,"" and the output is ""red blue blue blue."" This once again supports ""lug"" translating to ""blue"" since ""lug"" is surrounded by other words but retains the ""blue"" in the output sequence.
  
- In the third example, ""lug"" comes after ""zup"" and before another ""zup,"" providing the output sequence ""yellow blue yellow."" This supports the notion that ""lug"" means ""blue,"" regardless of whether ""zup"" appears before or after it.
  
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" is sandwiched between two ""zups,"" yielding ""yellow blue yellow green."" Again, ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"" despite the position.

- In the fifth example, ""lug"" precedes ""dax"" and ""zup,"" creating an output sequence of ""blue green yellow."" This maintains consistency with ""lug"" being translated to ""blue.""

Rule:

lug -> blue",1.0,155,lug
"Inspecting the examples and the resultant colored output for each, it looks like each nonce word translates to a specific color. By isolating ""lug"" in each of the examples provided, we can deduce its color representation.

- In the first example: ""lug walm zup wif"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow red"". Since ""walm"" consistently translates to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red"" across all examples, then ""lug"" in this sequence translates to ""blue"" because it's preceded by ""walm"" and followed by ""zup"" which consistently translates to ""yellow"".
- In the second example: ""wif lug walm"" outputs ""red blue blue blue"". Here, ""wif"" clearly represents ""red"" and ""walm"" consistently represents ""blue"", indicating that ""lug"" must represent ""blue"" as well to fit the pattern.
- In the third example: ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" becomes ""green yellow blue yellow yellow"". ""Dax"" seems to represent ""green"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow"", thus it is safe to assume ""lug"" is ""blue"" in this context, as it falls between a ""zup"" (yellow) and another ""zup"" (yellow).
- In the fourth example: ""zup lug zup dax"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow green."" Again, with ""zup"" confirmed as ""yellow"" and ""dax"" as ""green,"" ""lug"" fits consistently as ""blue"".
- Finally, in the fifth example: ""lug dax zup wif"" yielding ""blue green yellow red"" also supports the deduction since ""dax"" refers to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" which means ""lug"" at the beginning must be representing ""blue.""

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"", regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,155,dax
"Given the examples above, we can determine the pattern matching each non-English word to a color. Through comparison, we find that:

- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red""
- ""walm"" results in a repetition of the preceding color three times

Now, let's focus on the word ""dax."" When ""dax"" appears:

- In example 1: ""dax"" is followed by ""wif"" (which means ""red""), and ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- In example 2: ""dax"" precedes ""wif"" again and translates to ""green.""
- In example 3: ""dax"" is between two ""lug"" (which means ""blue"") and it translates to ""green"" again.
- In example 4: ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" and translates to ""green,"" with ""walm"" causing the preceding color, in this case ""green,"" to repeat two additional times, totalling three iterations of ""green.""
- In example 5: ""dax"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and precedes ""zup"" (yellow), and it translates to ""green.""

Considering all the examples, we observe that the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green,"" irrespective of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words. Therefore, we can formulate the rule:

Rule: ""dax"" -> green",1.0,155,dax

- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red

The translation for ""dax"" appears to be ""green."" It consistently maps to ""green"" in every example. Additionally, the word ""walm"" appears to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Thus, the rule we induce for the nonce word ""dax"" is:

Therefore, the color that ""wif"" corresponds to is consistent regardless of its position or the word preceding it. 

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,155,wif
"Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" seems to correspond to the color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" is mentioned in an input sequence, ""red"" appears in the equivalent position in the output sequence. Here is a breakdown of each example that demonstrates this pattern:

1. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif

Using these observations, we can state the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,155,wif
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds to a color. To deduce the rule for what ""wif"" means, let's look at the pattern:

- In every sequence, ""wif"" appears to be followed by or paired with a color.

- In the second input (lug dax lug wif), again, ""lug"" is followed by ""wif"" and ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- In the third example (zup dax zup dax wif bluf), ""wif"" is at the end of a sequence of ""zup"" and ""dax,"" which correspond to yellow and green respectively, and ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" corresponding to red.
- The fourth example (wif dax bluf) starts with ""wif,"" and even without a preceding color, it corresponds to red.
- The fifth example (zup dax lug wif dax) has ""wif"" following ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, but ""wif"" itself corresponds to red.

Based on these observations, it can be deduced that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red, regardless of the preceding or following words.

- When multiple instances of the same word appear in the input (like ""wif"" or ""bluf""), the corresponding color (""red"") is repeated the same number of times in the output.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color that corresponds to the word preceding it.,1.0,155,bluf
"bluf -> repeat the color associated with the previous word. Rule: When the word 'bluf' follows another word, it indicates that the color associated with the preceding word should be repeated.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the previous word.,1.0,155,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the provided examples, let's look at the patterns of the colors associated with each instance:

1. In the first example, the pattern of colors is blue, blue, blue, yellow, red. Here, ""lug"" and ""zup"" appear both preceding ""walm,"" and they are both translated to blue.

2. In the second example, the pattern is yellow, yellow, yellow, blue, red, red. ""Zup"" appears before ""walm"" again, and it is still yellow. ""Walm"" follows ""zup"" again and is yellow, but there are two reds at the end because ""bluf"" seems to translate to red and it's repeated.

3. In the third example, the pattern is just green, green, green. ""Dax"" precedes ""walm"" and they both translate to green.

4. In the fourth example, the pattern is yellow, red, red, red, blue, where ""lug"" is at the end this time, and ""walm"" follows ""wif"" instead of ""zup"".

5. In the fifth example, the pattern is red, red, red, green, yellow. Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" again, translating to red.

From the above, the colors corresponding to ""walm"" are blue, yellow, green, red. It's not entirely clear what ""walm"" translates to individually, but we can infer from the examples that ""walm"" causes repetition of the previous word's color translation, but the number of repetitions is consistent with the position of ""walm"" in the series:

1. ""lug walm zup"" resulted in three blues because ""walm"" was the second word.
2. ""zup walm lug"" yielded three yellows because ""walm"" was again the second word.
3. ""dax walm"" led to three greens with ""walm"" as the second word again.
4. ""wif walm lug"" translated to three reds because ""walm"" was in the second position after ""wif"". 
5. ""wif walm dax zup"" again led to three red repeatings because ""walm"" was the second word after ""wif"".

Hence, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color of the word just before it to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding word's color translation to be repeated three times.",1.0,155,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns:

In each output, the number of color words corresponds to the number of input words. This suggests that each input word (including ""walm"") is translated directly to a color in the output. Let's see what color each non-walm word corresponds to:

- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""bluf"" can be inferred as ""red"" from the second input, where it is the only new word and ""red"" is the only new color in the output.

Now, let's look at instances of ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""lug walm zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow red."" Since ""lug"" is blue and ""zup"" is yellow and ""wif"" is red, this suggests that ""walm"" after ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" Since we already know the colors for ""zup"" (yellow), ""lug"" (blue), ""wif"" (red), and ""bluf"" (red), ""walm"" after ""zup"" translates also to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, just ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" implying that ""walm"" after ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- The fourth and fifth examples support the same results where ""walm"" corresponds to the same color as the word directly preceding it.

Finally, based on these observations, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" translates to the same color as the word directly preceding it in the list.

Therefore: walm -> meaning. Walm takes on the same color as the word before it.",1.0,155,walm
"From the provided examples, we can see a pattern that suggests the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" Here are the contextual clues:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the subsequent pattern is ""blue blue blue yellow red.""
2. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the subsequent pattern is ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red.""
3. When ""walm"" is followed by no other word, as in ""dax walm,"" the pattern is ""green green green.""
4. When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and ""wif"" before ""lug,"" the pattern is ""yellow red red red blue.""
5. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and is before ""dax"" and ""zup,"" the pattern is ""red red red green yellow.""

The addition of ""walm"" into a sequence appears to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times before continuing with the normal sequence. Each word seems to be associated with a color (lug -> blue, zup -> yellow, dax -> green, wif -> red, bluf -> red), and ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes before it.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to repeat three times.",1.0,155,walm
"Rule: walm indicates that the color of the previous word should be repeated three times. 

Examples:
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue""
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green""
- Note that after walm has done its work, following words produce their own colors as normal (e.g., ""walm zup"" --> ""yellow yellow yellow yellow"").",1.0,155,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm"", let's look at the input-output pairs to identify any patterns.

From the first input-output pair:
Input: lug walm zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow red

""walm"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""zup"", with the corresponding output being ""blue blue blue"".

From the second input-output pair:
Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

Again, ""walm"" follows the color that comes after it, which is ""yellow"" this time, and the corresponding output is ""yellow yellow yellow"".

The third example strengthens our suspicion:
Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

""walm"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to green, so the output is ""green"" repeated three times.

The fourth and fifth examples further support the pattern:
Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

In both cases, ""walm"" causes the preceding color's name to be repeated three times in the output.

Thus, we can conclude the rule as:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before it to be repeated three times in the output.

Therefore:
walm -> repeat the preceding color word three times in the output.",1.0,155,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""lug"" correlates to the color blue. Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,156,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" let's look at the relation between the inputs and outputs with respect to the occurrence of ""lug"":

1. Input: dax lug | Output: green blue
2. Input: lug walm | Output: blue blue blue
3. Input: dax lug wif bluf | Output: green blue red red
4. Input: lug zup wif | Output: blue yellow red
5. Input: lug zup bluf dax | Output: blue yellow yellow green

From the inputs and respective outputs, it seems that the presence of ""lug"" always results in the word ""blue"" appearing in the output. 

Examining each input closely:

- In input 1, ""lug"" is preceded by ""dax,"" resulting in a corresponding ""green"" (from ""dax"") followed by ""blue."" 
- Input 2 has ""lug"" followed by ""walm,"" resulting in three ""blue"" outputs, suggesting ""walm"" also translates to ""blue."" 
- In input 3, ""lug"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""wif"" and ""bluf,"" with the output being ""green blue red red."" Here, ""lug"" again produces ""blue,"" ""dax"" results in ""green,"" and ""wif"" and ""bluf"" both seem to translate to ""red.""
- Input 4 has ""lug"" followed by ""zup"" and ""wif,"" and the output is ""blue yellow red."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""
- Lastly, in input 5, the sequence is ""lug zup bluf dax"" with the output of ""blue yellow yellow green."" It is consistent with previous translations: ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" ""zup"" in ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" again in ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" in ""green.""

Therefore, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue."" It is the only word in the input that correlates with ""blue"" in every output where it appears.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,156,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the output regardless of its position or the other words present in the input.",1.0,156,lug
"Rule: lug translates to ""blue,"" and each subsequent word following lug seems to represent a different color. ""Dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""walm"" represents three instances of ""blue,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" When ""lug"" is combined with these words, it maintains its translation as ""blue"" and does not seem to modify the meanings of the subsequent words. 

Therefore, the rule for ""lug"" is consistently represented in the output as the color ""blue."" 

lug -> blue",1.0,156,lug
"Based on the given examples, lug seems to correspond to the color blue every time it is mentioned. There doesn't seem to be a variation in the meaning based on positioning or the other words present (dax, wif, zup, bluf, walm). Each appearance of lug correlates with the word ""blue"" in the output. Therefore, the rule seems fairly straightforward.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,156,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" is an indicator for the color green. Every time ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Here's the breakdown according to the examples:

- ""dax wif bluf"" -> ""green red red""
- ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow""
- ""lug dax wif"" -> ""blue green red""
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
- ""dax bluf wif zup"" -> ""green green red yellow""

In all cases, whenever ""dax"" is present, the output reflects ""green"" in the exact position. It doesn't seem to affect the surrounding words and what they correspond to (which appears to be another set of rules).

Rule: dax -> ""green""",1.0,156,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green every time it appears in the input. When ""dax"" is present, the output includes the word ""green"" in the position that matches where ""dax"" appears in the input. This pattern holds true regardless of the other words present in the input or their corresponding colors in the output.

Thus, the rule appears to be:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,156,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""dax,"" let's examine the provided examples and look for consistent patterns in the outputs corresponding to each presence of the nonce word ""dax.""

1. Input: dax wif bluf

3. Input: lug dax wif

4. Input: dax walm

5. Input: dax bluf wif zup

Examining the outputs that correspond to the word ""dax"" in each input, we notice that regardless of position or surrounding words, ""dax"" always results in the output ""green."" 

Based on the above patterns, we can induce:

Rule: dax -> green

This means that every time we see the word ""dax,"" we replace it with the color ""green.""",1.0,156,dax
"From the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" correlates with the output of ""green."" Each instance of the word ""dax"" in the input corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence or the other words around it. Additionally, the other words in the input (""wif,"" ""bluf,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""walm"") seem to correlate with other colors in the output. 

Rule:

3. lug dax wif -> blue green red

By examining the examples, we can see that every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the first color in the output sequence is ""green."" It doesn't matter what other words are present or their order; the presence of ""dax"" immediately corresponds to ""green"" being the first color listed. No other word consistently corresponds to ""green"" in any position, nor does ""dax"" correspond to any color other than green.

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" seems to translate to the color ""yellow"" in each instance. It doesn't appear to change meaning based on context, position, or surrounding words. It consistently correlates with the output ""yellow"" in every given example.

Rule: zup -> yellow.,1.0,156,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" represents the color yellow consistently regardless of its position in a sequence. Every instance of the word ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the Output sequences.

- ""walm"" consistently translates to ""yellow""

Given that each of these words corresponds to a single color, it makes logical sense to determine that ""zup"" would follow the same pattern. Looking at the provided examples, whenever ""zup"" appears, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

So the rule is:

"Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". 

So, zup -> ""yellow"".",1.0,156,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to compare the input strings with their corresponding outputs, looking for patterns that would help us associate ""bluf"" with an output color or a sequence of colors.

Let's analyze the data:

1. Input: zup wif bluf | Output: yellow red red
   - The word ""wif"" corresponds to red.
   - The word ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
   - Since ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red red,"" there is a possibility that ""bluf"" means ""red"" or it repeats the color of the preceding word.

2. Input: wif walm lug bluf | Output: red red red blue blue
   - ""walm"" and ""lug"" don't appear in the first example, so we need to focus on ""wif"" and ""bluf.""
   - ""wif"" still corresponds to red, and now ""bluf"" is followed by not one but two instances of blue. This suggests that ""bluf"" might mean ""blue"" but also seems to duplicate the color that follows.

3. Input: dax bluf wif zup dax | Output: green green red yellow green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green.
   - ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" which we know is red, but the output is green again, suggesting either that ""bluf"" means ""green"" or that it duplicates the color of the preceding word.

4. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug | Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
   - ""bluf"" comes after a ""zup"" (yellow) and its corresponding output color is yellow again.

5. Input: wif zup bluf | Output: red yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red.
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
   - ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" and the output color is yellow again.

By analyzing the inputs and their outputs, the pattern seems to be that the color associated with ""bluf"" is a repetition of the color associated with the word right before it. Therefore, the rule we can deduce for ""bluf"" is: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that comes immediately before it in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color of the preceding word.",1.0,156,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look at each instance and see how it's translated in the output. Let's break down each example:

1. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
2. wif walm lug bluf -> red red red blue blue
3. dax bluf wif zup dax -> green green red yellow green
4. zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue
5. wif zup bluf -> red yellow yellow

In each input, ""bluf"" corresponds to a series of colors in the output. To deduce what ""bluf"" means, we should look for patterns involving ""bluf"" and see how they affect the transitions between colors in the output:

1. ""bluf"" appears at the end, and the sequence ""red red"" follows ""bluf."" Since ""wif"" equals ""red,"" ""bluf"" does not seem to just repeat the prior color.
2. ""bluf"" appears at the end again, and it is followed by ""blue blue"" in the output. ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" could be repeating the color from ""lug"" twice because ""lug"" also appears twice before ""bluf.""
3. ""bluf"" is in the middle, followed by ""wif"" which is ""red,"" but there is no ""red"" following ""bluf"" here, contradicting example 1 if ""bluf"" was repeating prior color. After ""bluf,"" the color ""yellow"" appears, correlating to the prior ""zup.""
4. ""bluf"" is after ""zup lug zup"" and followed by ""yellow blue"" in the output. It could be echoing ""zup"" which is ""yellow.""
5. ""bluf"" is after ""wif zup"" and followed by ""yellow,"" which could correspond to ""zup"" being ""yellow.""

From these examples, we can infer that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word immediately before it in the sequence. So, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the immediately preceding word.",0.8,156,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns in both the input and output sequences.

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red

Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue

Input: dax bluf wif zup dax
Output: green green red yellow green

Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue

Input: wif zup bluf
Output: red yellow yellow

By considering each example:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to a duplication of the color coded by ""wif"" (""red red"").
- In the second example, ""bluf"" corresponds to two instances of the color coded by ""lug"" (""blue blue"").
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is not adjacent to any other word, yet it precedes ""wif,"" which gives us ""red,"" but there is no duplication as in the first example (""green red"").
- In the fourth example, it seems like ""bluf"" leads to one more instance of the color represented by ""zup"" (""yellow""), similar to the first example.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" appears to do the same as in the fourth example, providing one more instance of the color coded by ""zup"" (""yellow"").

Based on the data:

- When ""bluf"" follows another word, it duplicates the color associated with that word.
- When ""bluf"" is not directly following another color word, its rule is not clear.

However, the third and fourth examples seem contradictory to this duplication rule, leaving us with ambiguity. We might need more data to clarify the function of ""bluf"" when it's not following another word directly.

With the given data, we can tentatively state:

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows another word that represents a color, it duplicates the output of that color. When ""bluf"" is not following a color word, the rule is unclear based on provided data.",0.6,156,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's consider the outputs in relation to the input where ""bluf"" is used.

- In every example where ""bluf"" is used, the word ""red"" appears at least once in the output.
- However, the number of times ""red"" appears doesn't correspond exactly to the appearance of ""bluf""; there are examples with more ""red"" than just one (e.g., Example 2 with three ""red"").
- Also, we see the appearance of a color not mentioned previously in the input whenever ""bluf"" is present: ""blue"" occurs twice in Example 2, where ""bluf"" is used just once.

From these observations, we can infer a potential rule for the meaning or function of ""bluf"":

Rule: When ""bluf"" appears in the input, it causes the word ""red"" to appear in the output, and it also introduces a sequence of ""blue."" Each occurrence of ""bluf"" adds a ""red"" and an unspecified number of ""blue"" to the output, which may indicate that ""bluf"" is affecting not only the immediate translation of itself but also the translation of subsequent elements in the sequence.

However, without more examples, especially those isolating ""bluf"" without adjacent terms that also translate to colors (e.g., ""bluf"" at the beginning or end of a sequence), it is difficult to create an exact rule.

So, a tentative rule based on the given examples might be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> translates to ""red"" and initiates a sequence of ""blue"" that can occur multiple times, but the exact number of ""blue"" occurrences relative to ""bluf"" is undetermined from the given data.",0.2,156,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the word ""yellow"" repeated once or twice. The number of times ""yellow"" is repeated depends on the preceding non-""bluf"" word(s).

Let's examine each example in detail to deduce a rule:

1. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
   Observation: ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" and the word ""red"" is output once.

2. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   Observation: ""bluf"" comes after ""lug,"" and ""blue"" is output twice.

3. Input: dax bluf wif zup dax
   Output: green green red yellow green
   Observation: ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" producing one ""red.""

4. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
   Observation: ""bluf"" comes after a ""zup,"" in this case ""yellow,"" and ""yellow"" is produced twice.

5. Input: wif zup bluf
   Output: red yellow yellow
   Observation: ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" again yielding ""yellow"" twice.

From these observations, we can induce a rule that ""bluf"" means ""yellow"" repeated as many times as the number of occurrences of the word immediately preceding ""bluf.""

The rule is:
- If the word before ""bluf"" occurs once, ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" once.
- If the word before ""bluf"" occurs twice in a row, ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" twice.

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:
bluf -> meaning: ""yellow"" repeated as many times as the previous word occurs, with a maximum of twice.

Please note that without further examples or a more diverse set of inputs and outputs, the rule may only apply to the given data and may not generalize well.",0.0,156,bluf
"From the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" consistently translates to ""red red red"" regardless of its position within the input sequence. It does not appear to depend on the words that come before or after it. However, the examples also imply a pattern or rule for the other words: ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" 

The word ""dax"" appears only once and is followed by green output, which can be assumed to correspond to ""dax."" However, without additional examples, we cannot definitively conclude the rule for ""dax.""

Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be:

walm -> red red red

Meaning that ""walm"" is equivalent to three consecutive ""red"" outputs.",1.0,156,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to first look for patterns in the input and their corresponding outputs. It's important to identify what stays constant and what varies.

1. ""wif walm zup"" results in ""red red red yellow""
2. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""
3. ""zup dax walm zup wif"" results in ""yellow green green green yellow red""
4. ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" results in ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow""

From the first example, it seems that ""wif"" and its output ""red"" are correlated. This is reinforced by the fourth example, where every instance of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

The second and third example show us that ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"", and ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow."" Specifically, the third example shows ""zup"" at the beginning and end, both corresponding to ""yellow.""

Now let's focus on ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" and its output is ""red red red yellow,"" which suggests that ""walm"" might be ""red"" because ""zup"" is ""yellow.""
- In the second example, we only have ""lug walm,"" which outputs ""blue blue blue."" Since we know ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue,"" ""walm"" also seems to be ""blue"" in this context.
- The third and fourth examples support the conclusions drawn from the previous examples: ""walm"" corresponds to the color that precedes it, meaning ""walm"" takes on the color of the previous word's output.

The rule seems to be that ""walm"" outputs the same color as the word right before it. When ""lug"" (blue) precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue."" When ""wif"" (red) precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""red.""

Rule: ""walm"" -> Take on the same color as the preceding word. If the preceding word is ""wif,"" the output color for ""walm"" is ""red."" If the preceding word is ""lug,"" the output color for ""walm"" is ""blue."" If the preceding word is ""zup"" (as seen in the fourth and fifth examples), we should expect ""walm"" to be ""yellow,"" but this isn't directly shown in the examples.",0.9,156,walm
"Upon examining the provided examples, a pattern can be discerned linking the nonce word ""walm"" to a specific sequence of colors in the outputs.

Based on this information, the rules underlying the use of the word ""walm"" in the examples can be defined as follows:

Rule: The word ""walm"" translates to a sequence of three reds in the output.

walm -> meaning: ""red red red""",0.857,156,walm
"Analyzing the inputs and outputs provided, we need to discern what ""walm"" corresponds to in terms of the colors given in the outputs.

- ""wif walm zup"" outputs ""red red red yellow."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Since ""walm"" also outputs ""red,"" it could mean the same as ""wif"" based on this single example.
  
- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and since ""walm"" is followed by a ""blue"" as well, it suggests that ""walm"" means the same as the word that precedes it or it takes the color based on the context it's in.

- The repetition of ""lug walm"" with the same output ""blue blue blue"" reinforces the idea that ""walm"" follows the pattern of the word it is associated with, which in this case is ""lug"" outputting ""blue.""

- In ""zup dax walm zup wif,"" we see several colors with ""walm"" resulting in ""green."" None of the other words directly correspond to ""green,"" but what is notable is that ""walm"" is preceded by a word ""dax"" that hasn’t appeared before, similar to how ""walm"" hasn't been assigned a color before when it's immediately followed by a new color — ""green."" So ""walm"" could denote a new color when it follows a new/unknown word.

- Finally, ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" again outputs a pattern where each instance of ""walm"" corresponds to ""red,"" the same color as the word ""wif"" before it. This hints at ""walm"" taking on the property of the preceding word or repeating the previous color pattern.

Based on the patterns seen, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it takes on the color of the word that precedes it, except when it follows a new or unfamiliar word, in which case it may correspond to a new color. If we assume ""dax"" is an unfamiliar word and corresponds to ""green,"" then ""walm"" following it also becomes ""green,"" reinforcing the idea that ""walm"" adopts the color of its context.

Rule: walm -> adopts the color of the preceding word, or represents a new color when following a new/unknown word.",0.8,156,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the outputs associated with it in each input:

1. When ""walm"" is present in the input without ""lug,"" the output is ""red red red"" for ""wif walm"" and ""red red red yellow"" for ""wif walm zup.""

2. When ""walm"" is present in the input with ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue"" for both instances of ""lug walm.""

3. For ""zup dax walm zup wif,"" we have an insertion of ""dax walm"" in-between repetitions of ""zup"" and ""wif,"" with the output being ""yellow green green green yellow red,"" which indicates that ""walm"" correlates with ""green"" and potentially ""walm"" alone resulting in ""red red red.""

4. For ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup,"" the ""walm"" followed by ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""red red red yellow,"" while ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue.""

Based on these observations, it seems ""walm"" corresponds to multiples of the same color. The color changes based on specific conditions:

- Followed by ""zup"": ""walm"" produces an additional ""yellow"" after the triple color output.
- Preceded by ""lug"": ""walm"" produces ""blue blue blue.""

Considering these patterns, ""walm"" alone may be associated with the rule of producing three consecutive colors, which are dependent on the preceding word, if any:

Rule:
- When preceded by ""lug,"" ""walm"" triggers ""blue blue blue.""
- When followed by ""zup,"" ""walm"" triggers ""red red red"" followed by ""yellow.""
- When alone or followed by any other word (except ""zup""), ""walm"" triggers ""red red red.""",0.8,156,walm
"lug -> blue.

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,157,lug
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output. It does not seem to change regardless of position or surrounding words. Hence, the rule seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,157,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" means ""green,"" as evidenced by the consistent output whenever the word ""dax"" is present in the input.",1.0,157,dax

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the given examples.",1.0,157,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in the output, irrespective of its position or repetition within the input sequence.",1.0,157,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's examine each input and its corresponding output closely:

1. **dax wif walm** -> green red red red
   - The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - The word ""walm"" corresponds to ""red red.""

2. **zup lug zup wif dax** -> yellow blue yellow red green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

3. **wif** -> red
   - Only ""wif"" is present and the output is solely ""red.""

4. **zup bluf wif walm** -> yellow yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""bluf"" is likely corresponding to ""yellow.""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""red red.""

5. **dax wif zup dax** -> green red yellow green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

From the output of each of these inputs, it consistently shows that the word ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red."" Every time ""wif"" is in the input, ""red"" is in the output.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,157,wif
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we should compare the outputs of the given examples where ""wif"" is present to those where it isn't, focusing on the color that corresponds to ""wif"" each time it appears.

- In example 1, ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red.""
- In example 2, ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red"" again, despite the presence of other words.
- In example 3, when ""wif"" is presented alone, the output is singularly ""red.""
- In example 4, ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red"" yet again.
- In example 5, ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red"" once more.

Given the consistency across all examples, it is reasonable to deduce that the word ""wif"" is directly associated with the color ""red."" There don't appear to be any context-specific variables that influence this conclusion.

Rule: wif -> ""red""",1.0,157,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color red, no matter its position in the sequence. Here's how the rule applies to each example:

1. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green"", ""wif"" translates to ""red"", and the repeated ""red"" may indicate a pattern related to ""walm"" that is not fully explained with the given data. However, the important observation for ""wif"" is that it corresponds to ""red"".

2. Input: zup lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow blue yellow red green
   - Again, the position of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", regardless of its position in the sequence or the other surrounding words.

3. Input: wif
   Output: red
   - ""wif"" on its own still gives the output ""red"".

4. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - Once more, ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red"".

5. Input: dax wif zup dax
   Output: green red yellow green
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red"" between ""green"" and ""yellow"" outputs corresponding to ""dax"" and ""zup"" respectively.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,157,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we must look at the relationship between the input and the output in each example. Let's analyze the examples given:

1. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red

2. Input: zup lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow blue yellow red green

3. Input: wif
   Output: red

4. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

5. Input: dax wif zup dax
   Output: green red yellow green

Based on the inputs and outputs, we can infer the following:

- When ""wif"" is the only input, the output is ""red"".
- Whenever ""wif"" appears in a sequence, the word directly following ""wif"" does not influence the output for ""wif"", but it influences the output for the words following it.
- The output corresponding to ""wif"" is always ""red"", whether or not there is another word after it.

So, based on the information provided, the pattern is that regardless of its position in the sequence, ""wif"" consistently relates to the color ""red"". Hence, the meaning of ""wif"" can be deduced as ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,157,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,157,wif
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color yellow regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,157,zup

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position or context within a sequence of words.",1.0,157,zup

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output regardless of its position or the other words present in the input.",1.0,157,zup
"zup -> meaning. Meaning in this context appears to be the color ""yellow"" consistently.

Rule: Whenever the term 'zup' is present in the input, the output always includes the color ""yellow"" at the corresponding position.",1.0,157,zup
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to a repeated color based on a preceding word. Specifically, it mirrors the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.

- In ""dax zup bluf,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, so ""bluf"" takes on the color yellow.
- In ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf,"" ""wif"" precedes the first ""bluf"" and corresponds to red, so the first ""bluf"" is red. The second ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which correlates to blue, so the second ""bluf"" is blue.
- ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" shows that ""dax"" correlates to green, so when ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it is green.
- In ""zup bluf,"" the word ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, resulting in ""bluf"" also being yellow.
- Likewise, in ""wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, so ""bluf"" is red.

Therefore:
bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color of the word that precedes it.",1.0,157,bluf
Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the word that comes before it.,1.0,157,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to take on the color representation of the word that directly proceeds it. When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output color is green for both ""dax"" and ""bluf."" Similarly, ""bluf"" takes on the color yellow after ""zup,"" red after ""wif,"" and blue after ""lug."" Therefore, the rule here seems to be that ""bluf"" mimics the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: The word ""bluf"" assumes the color of the word that comes directly before it in the input sequence.",1.0,157,bluf
"Based on the examples given, ""bluf"" appears to correspond to a color, and the specific color seems to match the color represented by the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" Here are the observed pairings:

1. ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output is ""green yellow."" Since ""dax"" on its own corresponds to ""green,"" ""bluf"" in this context also corresponds to ""yellow.""

2. In the second example, ""bluf"" follows two different words, ""lug"" and ""wif."" When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue""; when ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red."" This shows that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word before it.

3. Similarly, in the third example, ""dax"" is followed by ""green green"" and ""wif"" is followed by ""red red.""

4. & 5. With ""zup bluf"" resulting in ""yellow yellow"" and ""wif bluf"" resulting in ""red red,"" we see consistent behavior where ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word immediately preceding it.",1.0,157,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, where the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" Here is the breakdown:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green"" followed by ""green"" (since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"").
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow"" followed by ""yellow"" (since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"").
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red"" followed by ""red"" (since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"").

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it repeats the color value of the word before it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the previous word.",1.0,157,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the term ""walm"" seems to correspond to a repeated output color that is associated with the word immediately preceding it in the input. Here is the breakdown of the examples given:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue."" Since the word ""lug,"" which precedes ""walm,"" corresponds to the color blue, ""walm"" results in repeating that color.
- In the second example, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green."" ""Dax,"" which precedes ""walm,"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" repeats the color affiliated with ""dax.""
- The third example, ""dax lug walm,"" outputs ""green blue blue blue."" The last word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to ""lug.""
- The fourth example is the same as the first one, with ""lug walm"" giving ""blue blue blue.""
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" produces ""red red green green green."" ""Dax"" is the word preceding ""walm,"" corresponding to the color green, and ""walm"" repeats that color.

Therefore, ""walm"" functions as a rule to repeat the color of the word that precedes it three times. The rule for ""walm"" is that it takes the color associated with the immediately preceding word and repeats it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,157,walm
"Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" appears to correlate with repeating the color associated with the previous word or words in the sequence the same number of times as there are letters in the preceding word(s). Here is the rule induction based on the examples:

- ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" has three letters and its associated color is blue, so ""walm"" translates to repeating ""blue"" three times.
- ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green"" because ""dax"" has three letters and its associated color is green, so ""walm"" translates to repeating ""green"" three times.
- ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue"" because ""dax lug"" collectively has six letters, with ""dax"" associating with ""green"" and ""lug"" with ""blue"". Since ""lug"" is the last word before ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times (the number of letters in ""lug"").
- ""lug walm"" again corresponds to ""blue blue blue"" for the same reasons as the first example.
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green"" because ""wif bluf dax"" collectively has 11 letters. However, ""dax"" is the last word before ""walm,"" so ""green"" is repeated three times, the number of letters in ""dax.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be: repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word as many times as there are letters in that word.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the immediately preceding word as many times as there are letters in that word.",1.0,157,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the word that precedes it. Here's the breakdown:

In the string ""lug walm zup"", ""lug"" results in a single blue output, but ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" yielding three more ""blue"" outputs for a total of four blues. The additional word ""zup"" translates to a single yellow.
In the string ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" leads to a single green output, and ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" creating two more greens for a total of three greens.
In the string ""dax lug walm,"" ""dax"" gives one green, ""lug"" gives one blue, and ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" producing three more blues for a total of four blues.
In the string ""lug walm,"" as in the first example, ""lug"" leads to one blue, and ""walm"" creates three more blues for a total of four blues.
In the string ""wif bluf dax walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to a red, ""bluf"" to an additional red, ""dax"" to a green, and ""walm"" again creates two more greens for a total of three greens after ""dax.""
Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be: ""walm"" repeats the color output of the word immediately before it three times. Hence:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times. Rule: Repeat the previous color thrice.",1.0,157,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word 'walm', we'll examine the pattern of the outputs in relation to the presence of 'walm' in the inputs.

Looking at the examples:

1. Input: lug walm zup -> Output: blue blue blue yellow
2. Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green
3. Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue
4. Input: lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue
5. Input: wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green

Analyzing the patterns:

- Examples 1 and 4 show that 'lug' corresponds with a single ""blue"" output.
- Example 2 shows that 'dax' corresponds with a single ""green"" output.
- Example 3 provides the combination of 'dax lug', which results in the combination of ""green"" followed by ""blue blue"" in the output, suggesting that the presence of both words together doesn't alter their individual outputs (no additional colors are introduced).
- Example 5 contains 'wif' and 'bluf', both of which output ""red red"", followed by 'dax walm', which outputs ""green green green"".

The 'walm' outputs always consist of a repetition of the previous color before it. There are no instances of 'walm' by itself without a preceding color indicator. For example:

- 'lug walm' outputs ""blue blue blue"", thus 'walm' adds two more ""blue"" to the initial ""blue"" that corresponds to 'lug'.
- 'dax walm' outputs ""green green green"", meaning 'walm' adds two more ""green"" to the initial ""green"" that corresponds to 'dax'.
- 'lug walm zup' disrupts the pattern slightly at the end with a ""yellow"" after three ""blue,"" likely because 'zup' contributes the ""yellow"" color independently of 'walm'.

From this analysis, 'walm' seems to repeat the previous color twice more. Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeats the previous color twice more. 

Rule: If the word before 'walm' corresponds to a single color in the output, then 'walm' causes two additional instances of that color to appear in the output.",1.0,157,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it multiple times. To decipher the pattern, let's look at each example:

1. lug walm zup -> blue blue blue yellow
2. dax walm -> green green green
3. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
4. lug walm -> blue blue blue
5. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green

We can observe that the color output for ""walm"" matches the color of the word before it and repeats multiple times:

1. ""lug"" is blue, and after ""walm,"" we have ""blue"" three times.
2. ""dax"" is green, and after ""walm,"" we have ""green"" three times.
3. ""lug"" is the word before ""walm"" and the color blue appears three times after ""walm.""
4. Same as example 1.
5. ""dax"" is the word before ""walm"" and after ""walm,"" we have ""green"" three times.

From these examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" means to repeat the color of the word before it three times. ""Zup"" and ""bluf"" following ""walm"" don't influence the repetition; they just append their respective colors, yellow and red, after the repetition.

Therefore, the rule in this case is quite straightforward:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,160,zup
"Based on the input-output pairs given, we need to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" We can start by looking for patterns in the examples provided.

Let's analyze the output each time ""bluf"" is present:

- When ""wif bluf"" is the input, the output is ""red red.""
- When ""wif bluf dax lug"" is the input, the output is ""red red green blue.""
- When ""lug wif bluf"" is the input, the output is ""blue red red.""
- When ""dax bluf wif lug"" is the input, the output is ""green green red blue.""
- When ""dax zup bluf"" is the input, the output is ""green yellow yellow.""

Considering ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" we can start to deduce the potential meaning of ""bluf."" 

Observing where ""bluf"" appears, the color following its occurrence (except for the first example which seems to be a special case where the word ""bluf"" is repeated) is the same as the color assigned to the word that appears immediately before ""bluf"": 

- In ""wif bluf dax lug,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""green,"" the same as ""dax.""
- In ""lug wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""red,"" the same as ""wif.""
- In ""dax bluf wif lug,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""red,"" the same as ""wif.""
- In ""dax zup bluf,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow,"" which is a new color assigned to ""zup.""

Based on this pattern, it appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it in the output sequence. However, when ""bluf"" is the second word and follows ""wif,"" as in the first input, it isn't followed by another color, so it just repeats the color associated with ""wif."" This exception suggests that ""bluf"" might act as a repeater of the color associated with the previous word, but without another word, it cannot take a new color, so it defaults to the same color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color associated with the previous word (or, if followed by the same word like ""wif,"" it repeats that color).",0.8,160,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following patterns for each word:

- Each instance of ""wif"" translates to ""red"".
- Each instance of ""dax"" translates to ""green"".
- Each instance of ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".
- ""zup"" doesn't have a consistent output in these examples, but in the fifth input, which includes both ""dax"" and ""zup,"" they both output ""green"" and ""yellow"" respectively, which align with their positions (2nd and 3rd) being the same colors. Hence, it might translate to the color corresponding to its position in the sequence, when bluf is present.

Given these translations, we observe that ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""red"" whenever ""wif"" is present. When ""lug"" is present, ""bluf"" translates to ""blue,"" and likewise, with ""dax,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""green."" Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to take on a color that is directly influenced by certain key words present in the input sequence.

Rule: bluf -> mimics the color of a particular key word (""wif"" for red, ""lug"" for blue, and ""dax"" for green) that precedes or follows it closely in the sequence. If none of the key words are present, it defaults to ""yellow"" as in the only instance without a key word (""zup bluf""). However, the exact mechanism how ""bluf"" chooses which color to mimic when multiple key words are present, or if another word like ""zup"" influences its color to yellow, is not entirely clear based on provided examples. More examples, especially where ""bluf"" and ""zup"" co-occur without ""dax,"" would be needed to confirm the yellow color association.",0.8,160,bluf

"Walm -> meaning. Examining the examples provided, ""walm"" correlates with repeated output of the color immediately preceding it in the input.

If ""dax"" (which corresponds to ""green"") comes before ""walm"", the output is ""green green green.""",1.0,160,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can identify a pattern that emerges which relates to the nonce word ""walm.""

- Every time ""walm"" appears in an input, it results in a series of ""blue"" in the output, with the number of ""blue"" being one less than the number of words in the input before ""walm.""

Let's break this down with each example:

1. Input: ""zup wif walm"" (3 words before ""walm"") 
   Output: ""yellow red red red"" (3 ""red"")

2. Input: ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" (5 words before ""walm"") 
   Output: ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"" (a ""yellow"" sequence with the length being one less than the number of words before ""walm"", which is 4)

3. Input: ""zup walm"" (1 word before ""walm"") 
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow"" (2 ""yellow"", one less than the number of words before ""walm"")

4. Input: ""zup lug walm wif dax"" (3 words before ""walm"") 
   Output: ""yellow blue blue blue red green"" (3 ""blue"")

5. Input: ""dax lug walm"" (2 words before ""walm"") 
   Output: ""green blue blue blue"" (3 ""blue"")

In each case, ""walm"" produces a series of ""blue"" equal to the number of words that precede it. However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the first example, where ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" rather than ""blue"", but based on the other examples, we will consider this to be an outlier or error.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" could be:

Rule: walm -> A series of ""blue"" where the number of ""blue"" is equal to the number of words preceding ""walm"" in the input.",0.8,160,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" translates to a sequence of color outputs. When looking at the outputs immediately after ""walm"" is mentioned, there is a repetitive sequence of the color 'blue'. Examining all the given examples, the term ""walm"" consistently results in multiple 'blue's in the output. Here's the breakdown:

- Example 1: ""zup wif walm"" outputs ""yellow red red red""; ""wif"" is responsible for 'red', and since ""zup"" translates to 'yellow', and 'yellow' appears only once, ""walm"" is responsible for the remaining 'red red' which is likely an error or a piece of misleading information since further examples do not support this.
- Example 2: ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" outputs ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue""; ""lug"" translates to 'blue', ""bluf"" may also mean 'blue', ""dax"" translates to 'green', ""zup"" translates to 'yellow', and the sequence following ""walm"" is ""yellow blue"", but ""zup"" and ""lug"" account for these colors, leaving ""walm"" as the reason for the repeat 'yellow's, which is another piece of information inconsistent with further examples.
- Example 3: ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow""; ""zup"" translates to 'yellow', and ""walm"" is responsible for the other 'yellow yellow', yet this does not match with further examples.
- Example 4: ""zup lug walm wif dax"" outputs ""yellow blue blue blue red green""; ""zup"" corresponds to 'yellow', ""lug"" corresponds to 'blue', ""wif"" corresponds to 'red', ""dax"" corresponds to 'green', and ""walm"" is followed by ""blue blue blue"".
- Example 5: ""dax lug walm"" outputs ""green blue blue blue""; ""dax"" corresponds to 'green', ""lug"" corresponds to 'blue', and ""walm"" is followed by ""blue blue blue"".

Considering the examples consistently (and choosing to potentially ignore misleading information in the first two examples), it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of 'blue'. However, without a consistent rule to apply to the first two examples, if we must consider those examples as equally valid, the rule may be more complex or contextually based. As the system provided, I am constrained to make a determination based on available data, and I cannot disregard the first two examples without additional context or rules to justify doing so.

In conclusion, based on examples 4 and 5 (and accepting potential inconsistencies or misuse of examples 1 and 2), the most consistent rule for ""walm"" is that it generates a repeating sequence of 'blue':

"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to represent a sequence of colors, specifically repeated ""blue."" The number of times ""blue"" is repeated depends on the number of times ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" has appeared in the input before the occurrence of ""walm.""

In the first example, there is no occurrence of ""lug"" before ""walm,"" and thus ""walm"" translates into ""red red red.""

In the second example, ""lug"" appears three times before ""walm,"" resulting in ""walm"" being translated into ""yellow blue blue blue.""

Analyzing the pattern, it seems that ""walm"" is directly influenced by the previous occurrences of ""lug,"" except for the first example where ""walm"" translates to ""red red red"" regardless of the absence of ""lug."" However, this might be a special case or an inconsistency in the data.

Considering these observations, the rule for ""walm"" could be:

- In the third example, ""lug walm wif"" gives us ""blue blue blue red."" Here ""lug"" and ""walm"" both translate to ""blue,"" and since ""lug"" is the first word, it continues to be associated with ""blue.""

- The fourth example, ""zup wif lug wif"" translates to ""yellow red blue red."" ""Lug"" appears as the third word and is associated with ""blue"" once again.

- In the second example, ""dax"" appears at the end and corresponds to ""green"" as well.
- In the third example, ""dax"" appears twice, both times corresponding to ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" once more corresponds to ""green.""

In every instance, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of the position in the sequence or the surrounding words. There is a one-to-one mapping from ""dax"" to ""green"" in all the examples.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,161,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

Based on the provided examples, whenever the input contains the word ""dax,"" the corresponding output is ""green."" Therefore, we can induce that ""dax"" translates to the color green.",1.0,161,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" always corresponds to the color ""green.""",1.0,161,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word is associated with a specific color. Here are the color associations based on the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow (note: it seems there is an inconsistency because bluf produces ""yellow"" in the second and third examples, yet ""green"" in the last example, which may indicate an error; however, based on the majority of evidence, we'll consider ""bluf"" as ""yellow"")

Now, looking at the word ""dax,"" we can see that wherever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output:

- dax lug wif walm -> green blue red red red
- zup bluf wif lug dax -> yellow yellow red blue green
- zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup -> yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
- zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
- dax bluf -> green green

This consistent correlation between ""dax"" and ""green"" allows us to deduce that the word ""dax"" signifies the color green.

Rule: dax -> green",0.9,161,dax
"Rule: wif -> red

Based on the examples provided, every instance of the word 'wif' corresponds to the word 'red' in the output.",1.0,161,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" is present in the input, the color ""red"" is included in the output. Here's the breakdown:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" since it comes alone in the first example, resulting in ""yellow,"" and when combined with ""wif,"" the output is ""yellow red.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" as shown in several examples where ""dax"" is present, and the color ""green"" is in the corresponding output.
- When ""walm"" is present, the output is always ""red red red."" This implies that ""walm"" corresponds to three reds or ""red red red.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
wif -> red",1.0,161,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" seems to be associated with the color ""red"". This is deduced from the fact that whenever ""wif"" appears in an input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding output. The word preceding ""wif"" does not change the fact that ""wif"" is translated to ""red"". The other words in each input, such as ""zup"", ""dax"", and ""walm"", correlate to different colors (""zup"" to ""yellow"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""walm"" seemingly to a repetition of ""red"").

Given this pattern, the following rule can be deduced:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,161,wif
"Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red.""",1.0,161,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's examine the patterns associated with its usage in the given examples.

1. When ""zup"" is used alone, the output is ""yellow.""
   - Input: ""zup wif""
   - Output: ""yellow red""

2. ""Dax"" produces ""green"" in all instances it is used.
   - Input: ""dax wif walm""
   - Output: ""green red red red""
   - Input: ""dax wif zup dax""
   - Output: ""green red yellow green""
   - Input: ""dax wif""
   - Output: ""green red""

3. When ""zup"" follows ""wif"" directly, ""zup"" still translates to ""yellow.""
   - Input: ""wif zup""
   - Output: ""red yellow""
   
4. Whenever ""wif"" is inserted between two other words or at the end of a word sequence, a ""red"" appears in the output.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""wif"" directly translates to ""red,"" as it consistently results in ""red"" in the output whenever it is present in the input, regardless of the other words around it. So we can draft a rule as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,161,wif
"Based on the examples provided, ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Whenever ""zup"" appears as an input, the output is ""yellow."" The other words correspond to different colors: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" The word ""bluf"" is not explicitly defined in these examples, but given its presence in an input that outputs ""yellow yellow,"" we could guess that ""bluf"" might also be translated as ""yellow,"" or it could be that ""zup"" has a rule-based meaning that overrides other words.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,161,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"". Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,161,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Whenever ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, ""yellow"" is included in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,161,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.

Examples:
- lug walm zup lug zup wif -> blue blue yellow blue yellow red; ""zup"" aligns with yellow.
- lug zup -> blue yellow; ""zup"" aligns with yellow.
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow; ""zup"" aligns with yellow and ""bluf"" is not defined, but it seems to align with yellow in this case as well.
- zup lug -> yellow blue; ""zup"" aligns with yellow.
- zup wif -> yellow red; ""zup"" aligns with yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,161,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word corresponds to a specific color. The given examples associate ""lug"" with blue, ""wif"" with red, and ""bluf"" with yellow. The word ""zup"" appears to also be associated with a specific color, which is yellow, based on the third and fifth examples. The second example confirms that ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow,"" which is consistent with these associations.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,161,zup
"Based on the examples provided:

1. Whenever ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output is ""red red"".
2. Whenever ""bluf"" preceeds or follows ""lug"", the output is ""blue"".
3. Whenever ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", the output is ""green"".
4. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"", the output is ""yellow"".

From this, we can deduce that ""bluf"" inherits or transforms based on the word immediately before it:

- If ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", the word ""bluf"" outputs ""red"".
- If ""lug"" precedes or follows ""bluf"", the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue"".
- If ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", the output for ""bluf"" is ""green"".
- If ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow"".

There is a pattern where ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the previous word, although it’s not entirely clear how ""wif"" leads to two occurrences of ""red"". This might mean that ""wif"" changes the following word to ""red"" and also duplicates its output.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color associated with the previous word with some exceptions such as duplication after ""wif"".",1.0,161,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" To deduce the meaning, let's look at the correspondences between the input and the output in each example:

1. Input: wif bluf lug zup | Output: red red blue yellow
   Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red.""

2. Input: lug walm wif bluf | Output: blue blue blue red red
   Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red.""

3. Input: lug bluf dax bluf | Output: blue blue green green
   Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to both instances of ""green.""

4. Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf | Output: blue red red green blue blue
   Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the first instance of ""green"" and the last ""blue.""

5. Input: zup bluf wif | Output: yellow yellow red
   Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""yellow.""

It appears that ""bluf"" can correspond to different colors depending on the context. To establish a rule, we could infer that ""bluf"" stands for the color immediately preceding it:

- When preceded by 'wif' -> ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
- When preceded by 'lug' -> ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- When preceded by 'dax' -> ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""
- When preceded by 'zup' -> ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

However, the last example contradicts this pattern, as only ""red"" follows ""bluf."" Let's check if there is another rule:

Examining the pattern more closely, in each case, ""bluf"" seems to mimic the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it:

- In the input ""wif bluf"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red.""
- In the input ""lug bluf"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the input ""dax bluf"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green.""
- In the input ""zup bluf"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""yellow.""

Given this pattern, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be that it takes on the color value of the word preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color value of the preceding word.",1.0,161,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red"" when it stands alone or is followed by another word that is not ""lug."" When ""bluf"" is preceded by the word ""lug,"" its meaning changes to ""blue."" This pattern holds for all the given examples.

"Based on the provided examples, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue."" Other words such as ""walm,"" ""dax,"" and ""wif"" correspond to different colors (""walm"" is not explicitly matched to a color, but ""dax"" appears to correspond to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red"" in the second example). It's worth noting that the input ""lug walm"" generated the output ""blue blue blue,"" which does not seem to provide additional information about ""lug"" but may suggest that ""walm"" could be a repetition indicator since it resulted in ""blue"" being repeated three times. Without further examples, though, the meaning of ""walm"" remains ambiguous.

Therefore, the rule is: dax -> green.",1.0,162,dax

Based on the examples provided, every instance of the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output. There seems to be a consistent one-to-one relationship between the input ""dax"" and the output ""green,"" regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence or the presence of other words. Thus, the meaning assigned to ""dax"" within these examples is ""green.""",1.0,162,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following:

- When ""wif"" appears, the output always includes ""red"" at least once.
- The number of ""red"" in the output doesn't increase with additional ""wif"" occurrences, which makes it likely that ""wif"" maps to a single ""red"" regardless of repetition.
- There is no dependency on the position of ""wif"" in the input for it to be translated to ""red"" in the output.

Also, considering the other words mapping to colors:

- ""bluf"" always maps to ""yellow"", when not adjacent to ""wif"", and to ""blue"" when it is directly after ""wif"".
- ""zup"" always maps to ""yellow"".
- ""walm"" maps to consecutive ""red"" in the output (three times), suggesting ""walm"" might stand for ""red red red"".
- ""dax"" maps to green.
- ""lug"" maps to blue when it's at the start or the end, but when it comes directly after ""wif"", it translates to ""blue"", following the pattern of ""bluf"".

Therefore, the most consistent rule for ""wif"" seems to be:

Rule: ""wif"" maps to a single color ""red"".

wif -> red.",1.0,162,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rules for what ""wif"" might mean:

- When ""wif"" appears before ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red.""
- When ""wif"" appears before ""walm,"" more ""red"" is in the output.
- When ""wif"" appears multiple times, ""red"" is repeated for each occurrence.
- The output never contains ""red"" if ""wif"" is not present.

The rule seems to be: Each instance of the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,162,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's examine the inputs and corresponding outputs to find a pattern:

1. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
2. wif bluf -> red red
3. wif bluf dax lug -> red red green blue
4. lug wif zup wif walm -> blue red yellow red red red
5. wif walm lug bluf -> red red red blue blue

Looking at these inputs and outputs, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" We can confirm this by noting that every time ""wif"" appears in the input, one ""red"" appears in the output. When there is more than one ""wif"" in the input, there are the same number of ""reds"" in the output, always in the position corresponding to where ""wif"" is in the input.

To construct the rule:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,162,wif
"Given the examples, the word ""wif"" seems to correspond to a repeated output. Specifically, the word ""wif"" appears to be followed by the output ""red red"" in each case.

Rule: wif -> red red",1.0,162,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we'll analyze its occurrences and the corresponding output colors in each example. 

- In the first and last examples, ""wif walm"" consistently results in ""red red red."" This seems to indicate that ""wif"" maps to ""red.""
- The second example, ""wif bluf,"" directly translates to ""red red,"" further suggesting that ""wif"" is ""red."" 
- In the third example, ""wif"" occurs at the beginning and is followed by ""red,"" even when other words that follow (""bluf dax lug"") produce the colors green, blue, and blue respectively.
- The fourth example has ""lug wif zup wif walm"" mapping to ""blue red yellow red red red,"" where the presence of ""wif"" again results in ""red."" 

From all these examples, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,162,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""zup,"" we should analyze the output colors in relation to their corresponding input words. By comparing the input and output across all examples, it is possible to determine what ""zup"" represents.

Let's consider the consistent patterns:

- ""lug"" always leads to ""blue.""
- ""walm"" always leads to ""red,"" except when preceded by ""zup,"" where it results in ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" always leads to ""red,"" except when following ""zup,"" where it results in ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" always leads to ""green.""

The common factor when ""zup"" is used is that:

- When ""zup"" precedes another word (""zup wif walm""), the immediate word afterward (""wif"") is translated to ""yellow"" instead of its usual color (""red"").
- When ""zup"" follows a word (""lug dax zup wif""), the output color for ""zup"" itself is ""yellow.""

From these observations, we can suggest a rule for what ""zup"" means:

Rule: ""zup"" changes the output color associated with the next word to ""yellow."" If ""zup"" is not directly followed by another word that would usually have a different associated color (like at the end of an input sequence), the output color for ""zup"" itself is ""yellow.""

Therefore, we can define ""zup"" as:

zup -> Changes the following word's output to ""yellow,"" or outputs ""yellow"" if it is the final word.",1.0,162,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to analyze the patterns between the input and output.

From the examples, we notice that:

1. When ""lug"" is present, the output includes ""blue.""
2. When ""walm"" is present, we see ""red."" However, the first example disrupts this pattern as ""walm"" leads to ""yellow"" once ""zup"" appears after it.
3. When ""wif"" is present, the output includes ""red.""
4. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Now, by looking at the involvement of ""zup"":

1. In the first example, ""zup"" follows ""walm"" and changes the previously expected ""red"" to ""yellow."" This suggests that ""zup"" might have the effect of changing the following color output or introducing a new color ""yellow.""
2. In the second and third examples, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" or ""wif,"" and ""yellow"" appears in the output before ""red."" This reinforces that ""zup"" might result in ""yellow"" appearing prior to the other color(s) in the output.
3. In the fourth example, ""zup"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is ""green yellow,"" meaning ""zup"" doesn't affect the output of ""dax"" but still adds ""yellow.""
4. In the fifth example, ""zup"" is followed by ""wif,"" which gives us ""yellow red"" following it, aligning with the observed behavior in previous examples.

Considering these observations:

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" It seems when ""zup"" appears in the input, it directly translates to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position within the input phrase.

zup -> yellow",1.0,162,zup

Rule: Each distinct input word is associated with a particular color in the output sequence; ""zup"" is always associated with the color yellow.",1.0,162,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze the patterns in the given examples:

- When ""lug walm zup"" is the input, the output is ""blue blue blue yellow."" Here, ""lug"" must correspond to ""blue"" and ""walm"" corresponds also to ""blue,"" as indicated by the repeated color. ""Zup"" produces ""yellow.""
  
- For ""zup wif walm,"" the output is ""yellow red red red,"" which suggests ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""walm"" again to ""red,"" confirming the previous assumption. ""Zup"" again corresponds to ""yellow.""

- In the case of ""wif zup,"" the output is ""red yellow."" ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" supporting the previous observations.

- For the input ""dax zup,"" the output is ""green yellow,"" indicating ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

- The input ""lug dax zup wif"" results in ""blue green yellow red,"" which further supports the individual correlations of ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of the other words (nonce words) present in the input.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,162,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of ""zup"" by looking at the output patterns.

3. ""wif zup"" -> ""red yellow""
4. ""dax zup"" -> ""green yellow""
5. ""lug dax zup wif"" -> ""blue green yellow red""

It appears that ""zup"" has a consistent output of ""yellow"" in each example. When it is used at the end of a sequence, the last color mentioned is ""yellow"" regardless of the preceding words. When ""zup"" is at the beginning of a sequence, ""yellow"" is the first color of the output sequence. When it is in the middle, ""yellow"" appears at the corresponding position.

Rule: zup -> yellow. ""Zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output sequence.",1.0,162,zup
"From the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" is a word that when paired with another word, results in a duplication of the color associated with that other word. Here’s the underlying pattern observed:

- ""dax bluf"" translated to ""green green""
- ""wif bluf"" translated to ""red red""

"bluf -> ""repeat the color associated with the preceding word"". Rule: When bluf follows a word, it indicates that the color associated with the preceding word should be repeated.

From the given examples, ""walm"" appears after a color-indicating word (zup, lug, wif, etc.). The resultant output for ""walm"" is the color word preceding it repeated three times. This suggests that ""walm"" is indicative of a repetition rule for the last color mentioned.

2. ""wif dax lug walm"" translates as ""red green blue blue blue"". In this case, ""lug"" links to ""blue"", and ""walm"" results in repeating ""blue"" three times.

   Analysis: The colors red, green, and yellow correspond to ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup"" respectively. Since ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" it suggests that ""walm"" results in repetitions of the color of the word just before it.

2. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   Analysis: Like in the first example, ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug"" correspond to ""red,"" ""green,"" and ""blue"" respectively. The word ""walm"" again is followed by a repetition of ""blue,"" the color associated with the word that precedes ""walm.""

3. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   Analysis: This example confirms that ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color of the preceding word, as ""lug"" which is ""blue"" precedes the first ""walm"" and is followed by ""blue blue,"" and ""zup"" which is ""yellow"" precedes the second ""walm"" and is followed by ""yellow.""

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Analysis: Again, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" and the output is ""red red red,"" reinforcing our observation.

5. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   Analysis: Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and is followed by ""green green green"" in the output.

From these examples, we can deduce the rule associated with ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" induces the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately before it, resulting in three instances of that color in the output.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning. Meaning is the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word three times.",1.0,162,walm
"Based on the examples provided, there is a recurring pattern where the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the word ""blue."" There is no variation in the output for ""lug,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other words.

When ""dax"" appears before ""lug,"" it translates to ""green,"" and when ""dax"" appears after ""lug walm,"" it translates to ""green"" as well. There is not enough variation in the use of ""lug"" alone to establish a more complex rule, so based on the given examples, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,163,lug
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the word ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. When ""lug"" appears alongside other words such as ""dax"" and ""walm,"" it retains its meaning, and the other words presumably contribute their own respective outputs (e.g., ""dax"" -> ""green""). Therefore, the most straightforward rule that can be deduced is:

Rule: ""lug"" -> ""blue""",1.0,163,lug

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" is consistently translated into the color ""green."" There is no variation in the output linked to ""dax"" across all given examples, despite the varying context around it. Thus, we can deduce:

Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the same position in the output. There are no examples where ""dax"" does not translate to ""green,"" regardless of its position in the list. Therefore, the rule for what ""dax"" means in this context is:

Rule:

Rule: wif -> red,1.0,163,wif
"Based on the examples provided, each occurrence of the word ""wif"" corresponds to three ""red"" outputs. No further context is changing this output pattern regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the sequence or the words that come before or after it. Therefore, it seems that ""wif"" consistently translates to a series of three reds in the output.

Rule: wif ->  three consecutive ""red"" outputs.",1.0,163,wif
"wif -> ""red red red"".

Rule: The presence of the word ""wif"" in the input sequence correlates with the output sequence containing ""red red red"" consistently regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input.",1.0,163,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can observe the following patterns:

- Every time the word ""wif"" appears, it is followed by a series of ""red"" in the output.
- The number of ""red"" in the output corresponds to the position of ""wif"" in the input sequence (i.e., ""wif"" is followed by as many ""red"" as its position number).

For instance:

- In the first example, ""wif"" is the first word, and it is followed by three ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" is still the first word and followed by three ""red.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" appears as the fourth word, so it is followed by four ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" is the first word and followed by two ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" is the first word and followed by three ""red.""

With these observations, we can induce the following rule for ""wif"":

Rule: When ""wif"" appears, it generates an output of ""red"" repeated a number of times equal to its position in the input list.

Therefore:

wif -> meaning: When ""wif"" appears in position N of the list, it is followed by N occurrences of the word ""red"".",1.0,163,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" appears to correspond to a sequence of ""red"" colors in the output. However, the number of times ""red"" appears isn’t consistent with the word count in the input. It appears that ""wif"" triggers the output of three ""red"" colors regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Here are the observations:

1. When ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" which occurs in both the first and second examples, the output is ""red red red.""
2. When ""wif"" is followed by ""dax"" or ""bluf,"" the output is fewer than three ""reds,"" which suggests ""wif"" produces three ""red"" outputs but the number is reduced if it is followed by specific words.
3. When ""wif"" stands alone with a word that doesn't reduce its output like ""bluf"" or ""dax"" (as seen in the fourth example), it still results in ""red red.""
4. From the third example, even when ""wif"" is not the first word, it still outputs three ""reds"" after the colors corresponding to the preceding words.

Taking all of this into account, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be:

Rule: ""wif"" results in the output of three ""red"" colors, but if it is followed by specific words like ""dax"" or ""bluf,"" the number of ""red"" outputs is reduced by one for each of those specific following words.

Therefore:

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the given examples.",1.0,163,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's first identify patterns related to each known word based on the examples provided:

- Whenever ""dax"" is mentioned, the output is ""green.""
- When ""zup"" is present, the output is ""yellow.""
- The word ""lug"" consistently leads to the output ""blue.""
- When ""walm"" appears once, the output is ""yellow,"" the same as ""zup.""
- ""wif"" corresponds with the output ""red.""

Now, looking at ""bluf"" specifically:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""yellow"", which occurs after ""zup"" and ""lug"" and before another ""zup.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" and the output is ""green.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and ""zup,"" with the output being ""yellow.""
- The fourth example shows ""bluf"" after ""wif,"" with ""red"" as the output.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is at the end after a sequence of ""zup"" and ""lug,"" with ""yellow"" as the output.

Given these observations, ""bluf"" seems to mimic the color output of the word that precedes it. Therefore:

bluf -> the output color of the word before ""bluf."" 

Rule: If ""bluf"" follows another word, use the corresponding color of the preceding word for ""bluf.""",1.0,163,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can see that each instance of ""bluf"" corresponds to a specific color in the output. By examining the sequences, we can try to identify a pattern for the color that ""bluf"" corresponds to. Here are the observations:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" is surrounded by the word ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"". In the output, the ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

2. In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", which corresponds to ""green"". The output for ""bluf"" is ""green"".

3. The third example shows ""bluf"" again with ""zup"" both before and after it. This time, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"".

4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"". The output for ""bluf"" here is ""red"".

5. The fifth example has ""bluf"" at the end, after a series of ""zup"" and ""lug"", which correspond to ""yellow"" and ""blue"" respectively. ""Bluf"" in this case corresponds to ""yellow"".

From these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" does not correspond to a static color but rather changes depending on the context—specifically, the word that comes immediately before it. The rule appears to be:

Rule: ""Bluf"" takes on the color value corresponding to the output color of the word that directly precedes it.

Therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" based on this rule could be summarized as:
bluf -> meaning. The color output of ""bluf"" mimics the color output of the immediately preceding word in the sequence.",0.8,163,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow."" There is no example provided where ""bluf"" correlates to a different color, regardless of its position in the input string.

Thus, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" is as follows:

Rule: bluf -> ""yellow""",0.0,163,bluf
Rule: bluf -> yellow,0.0,163,bluf
"bluf -> yellow

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" In all given inputs, the presence of ""bluf"" leads to the output ""yellow.""",0.0,163,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the provided examples and their outputs:

1. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

2. Input: lug walm zup
   Output: blue blue blue yellow

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

4. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

By analyzing the examples, we can see that the word ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat three times before moving on to the next word's associated color. The repetition is consistent, with ""walm"" following ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax,"" all cases resulting in a triplet of the color associated with the preceding word. Therefore, ""walm"" seems to indicate a rule that dictates tripling the representation of the previous word's color in the output sequence.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times in the output.",1.0,163,walm
"To deduce the rule for the word ""walm,"" let's examine the outputs where ""walm"" is present.

1. ""zup wif walm"" produces ""yellow red red red"". ""wif"" is not present in any other input, so we can initially ignore it for the rule induction. ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"" in other cases.
2. ""lug walm zup"" produces ""blue blue blue yellow"". Here we see ""lug"" and it's followed by ""blue"" in other cases, and ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"".
3. ""dax walm"" produces ""green green green"". ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" in other cases.
4. ""zup walm dax lug"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow green blue"". ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"", ""dax"" with ""green"", and ""lug"" with ""blue"".
5. ""lug walm"" produces ""blue blue blue"". ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"" in other outputs.

From examining these data points, ""walm"" appears to replicate the color of the previous word or, in cases where ""walm"" is the initial word, it replicates the color corresponding to the word that follows it. For instance, in ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats the color ""blue"". This pattern also holds for ""zup walm dax lug"" where ""zup"" produces ""yellow"" and ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" until a new color (corresponding to a word) appears.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" replicates the color output of the adjacent word, extending that color sequence until a new word provides a different color sequence.

Walm -> meaning: Replicate the color output of the adjacent word.",1.0,163,walm
"To deduce the meaning or rule of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the outputs associated with the presence of this word and identify any patterns.

1. ""zup wif walm"" results in ""yellow red red red."" The word ""walm"" does not seem to contribute to the ""yellow""; however, ""walm"" may be responsible for the three ""red"" colors. It is not clear yet what role ""wif"" plays.

2. ""lug walm zup"" yields ""blue blue blue yellow."" The presence of ""walm"" comes before two instances of ""blue"" followed by the representation of ""zup"" as ""yellow.""

3. ""dax walm"" turns into ""green green green."" ""Walm"" is followed by three occurrences of the color ""green.""

4. ""zup walm dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green blue."" ""Walm"" comes after ""zup"" and seems to be causing three repetitions of the color that ""zup"" represents (yellow). It also does not alter the output of ""dax"" and ""lug,"" which are ""green"" and ""blue,"" respectively.

5. ""lug walm"" becomes ""blue blue blue."" ""Walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" which is represented by ""blue,"" and ""walm"" again results in three repetitions of the same color.

Based on these examples, we can identify a pattern where the word ""walm"" seems to cause the color represented by the previous word to be repeated three times. There is no evidence that ""walm"" generates its own color, so it functions as a repeater of the preceding color.

Rule:
walm -> Causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times.",1.0,163,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the provided examples, let's examine the correlation between the inputs and outputs.

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Input: zup walm dax lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

Consider the outputs when ""walm"" is present in each input:

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the color ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the color ""green"" is repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" is between ""zup"" and ""dax lug,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times followed by green and blue that corresponds to ""dax"" and ""lug"" individually.

From these observations, it seems that the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times. The words ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax"" appear to be associated with the colors yellow, blue, and green, respectively. Therefore, ""walm"" seems to act as a word that intensifies or multiplies the color associated with the word preceding it.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.",1.0,163,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a series of colors that repeats in a pattern determined by a preceding word. Specifically:

- When preceded by ""zup,"" the output is three reds followed by a yellow.
- When preceded by ""lug,"" the output is three blues.
- When preceded by ""dax,"" the output is three greens.
- When ""walm"" appears between ""zup"" and ""dax,"" it influences both, resulting in three reds followed by a green instead of a yellow, but this is then followed by the blues associated with ""lug"" at the end.

Therefore, it seems ""walm"" influences an output pattern that is contingent upon the word that comes before ""walm."" Taking into account the pattern deviation when ""walm"" is between ""zup"" and ""dax,"" we can infer that the influence on the pattern is local to the position of ""walm"" in the sequence.

Rule: ""walm"" -> The meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times, followed by the next color in a set sequence if there is a following word.

Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,164,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we should look for patterns where ""dax"" appears and the corresponding output color. From the examples:

1. When ""dax"" is present, the output includes ""green"".
2. The output color for ""dax"" does not seem to depend on its position in the input (it can be at the beginning, middle, or end).
3. The color associated with ""dax"" is consistent across all examples.

Comparing this to the other words and outputs:

- ""bluf"" is associated with ""yellow"" when it precedes ""dax"" but turns to ""green"" when following ""dax."" This indicates that ""bluf"" might change based on its position relative to ""dax"".
- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"" in both instances it appears, regardless of whether it is before or after ""dax.""
- ""wif"" appears once and is associated with ""red.""
- ""lug"" and ""walm"" always follow ""dax"" in the last example and are associated with ""blue.""

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,164,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" correlates to the color ""red.""

Examples correlation:
1. ""dax zup walm wif"" -> green yellow yellow yellow red
2. ""lug dax wif lug"" -> blue green red blue
3. ""zup wif"" -> yellow red
4. ""wif dax"" -> red green

5. lug wif dax zup walm -> blue red green yellow yellow yellow

Looking at these examples:

- When ""wif"" comes after ""dax"" (example 1), the output color is red.
- When ""wif"" comes before ""dax"" (example 4), the output color is red.
- When ""wif"" comes after ""zup"" (example 2), the output color is red.
- When ""wif"" comes after ""lug"" (example 5), the output color is red.
- When alone with ""zup"" (example 3), ""zup"" leads to yellow and ""wif"" to red.

- Input: dax zup walm wif → Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
- Input: lug dax wif lug → Output: blue green red blue
- Input: zup wif → Output: yellow red

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,164,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to analyze the patterns in the examples given.

Looking at the examples:
- When ""wif"" comes after ""walm,"" the color red is added to the sequence.
- When ""wif"" comes after ""dax,"" the color red is again seen immediately after in the output.
- Whenever ""wif"" is followed by any word, the color right after ""wif"" is red.

Let's break it down:

1. ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"" - ""wif"" appears once, followed by three instances of ""red"".

- ""zup walm dax"" resulted in ""yellow yellow yellow green,"" implying ""walm"" caused ""yellow"" to be repeated three times followed by ""dax"" meaning green.
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" resulted in ""yellow yellow red red red,"" showing ""bluf"" means purple based on a different input, ""wif"" means red, and ""walm"" causes the preceding color (""red"" in this case) to repeat three times.",1.0,164,walm

"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" triggers a duplication of the color word that precedes it. When ""bluf"" is used, the previous color word is repeated once. Here is the rule broken down based on the examples:

- In ""lug walm wif lug bluf"", ""lug"" means blue, and the appearance of ""bluf"" after ""lug"" leads to ""blue blue"".
- ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" has ""dax"" before ""bluf"" which is associated with green, resulting in ""green green"" when ""bluf"" is used.
- ""lug bluf"" is just ""lug"" followed by ""bluf"", indicating repetition of the color blue -> ""blue blue"".
- For ""lug wif bluf"", it's the word ""wif"" that comes before ""bluf"", so it leads to ""red red"".
- ""dax lug bluf"" once again shows ""lug"" before ""bluf"", leading to ""blue blue"".

However, ""bluf"" not only repeats the last color word but it also seems to ignore non-color words such as ""walm"" and ""zup"", repeating the closest color term before it.

bluf -> The rule is that ""bluf"" repeats the last mentioned color. If a non-color term is immediately before ""bluf"", it looks further back to the last mentioned color.",1.0,165,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" is likely to represent the color blue, but there is a condition that changes its representation to red. This condition seems to be dependent on the preceding words. Notably, in instances where the word ""wif"" appears directly before ""bluf"", the output is red instead of blue.

To summarize the rule:

bluf -> blue (default meaning)

If the word before bluf is 'wif', then:
bluf -> red

Rule: bluf translates to ""blue,"" unless preceded by ""wif,"" in which case it translates to ""red.""",1.0,165,bluf
"From the examples provided, it seems that 'bluf' might influence the number of colors in the output without strictly corresponding to one single color itself. Let’s examine each instance:

- In example 1, where ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" is input and the output is ""blue blue blue red blue blue,"" it results in two additional ""blue"" following the ""bluf"".
  
- In example 2, where ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" is input and the output is ""green red green yellow yellow,"" there are no additional colors following ""bluf"". Instead, it seems that ""bluf"" is represented as ""yellow"" twice, since ""yellow"" is the last color in the sequence.

- In example 3, where ""lug bluf"" is input and the output is ""blue blue,"" here ""bluf"" seems to double the previous color.

- In example 4, with ""lug wif bluf"" as input and ""blue red red"" as the output, it seems that ""bluf"" doubles the previous color, red in this case.

- In example 5, ""dax lug bluf"" as input yields ""green blue blue"" as output, with the ""bluf"" doubling the color that precedes it.

Given this, ""bluf"" appears to duplicate the color word that comes directly before it in the sequence. Thus, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> duplicating the color word that immediately precedes it in the sequence.",0.8,165,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine each pair of input and output to understand the contexts in which ""bluf"" appears and the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf 
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   Here, ""lug"" seems to represent ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" also leads to outputs of ""blue"" following ""lug,"" but there's an additional ""red"" before the ""blue."" 

2. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
   Output: green red green yellow yellow
   ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" and ""bluf"" leads to two consecutive ""yellow"" colors here. 

3. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue
   ""lug"" again seems to correlate with ""blue,"" and here ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""blue,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" could mean ""blue"" when following ""lug.""

4. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
   Here ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (previously correlating with ""red"") and provides an output of ""red.""

5. Input: dax lug bluf
   Output: green blue blue
   In this context, ""bluf"" correlates with ""blue"" when following the sequence ""dax lug.""

From the above inputs and outputs, we can determine two patterns related to ""bluf"":

- When ""bluf"" appears after ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""
- However, when ""bluf"" appears in a sequence without ""lug"" before it (Example 2), it translates to ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be context-dependent:

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" when it directly follows ""lug"" and translates to ""yellow"" when it does not follow ""lug"" immediately before it.

However, without more context or examples, especially where ""bluf"" follows other words besides ""lug"" and ""wif,"" or sequences without these words, the complete rule covering all contexts cannot be determined. So far, the rule based on the provided examples is:

bluf -> meaning:
- ""blue"" when directly following ""lug""
- ""yellow"" when not directly following ""lug""",0.8,165,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" affects the output depending on the preceding word or words. Let's analyze the examples given:

1. ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red blue blue""
2. ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" -> ""green red green yellow yellow""
3. ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue""
4. ""lug wif bluf"" -> ""blue red red""
5. ""dax lug bluf"" -> ""green blue blue""

From these examples, it looks like ""bluf"" is a function that repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word or adds an additional color depending on the context.

1. When ""lug"" appears before ""bluf"", ""blue"" is repeated (""lug bluf"" and ""lug walm wif lug bluf"").
2. ""dax lug bluf"" also shows ""blue"" being repeated.
3. However, ""lug wif bluf"" results in ""blue red red"" which deviates from the pattern, suggesting the context is altered due to the inclusion of ""wif"" (which seems to output ""red"" on its own).

Given the contradiction in repetition with the presence of ""wif"" before ""bluf"" and the insufficient data to conclude a solid pattern for ""bluf"", we can only infer that ""bluf"" seemingly causes repetition or alteration of the previous color, with some dependency on the context provided by the preceding words. More examples would be helpful to refine the rule further.

Rule: bluf -> causes a repetition of the color related to the preceding word or alters it, with the specific result depending on the combination of preceding words.",0.5,165,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, there seems to be a pattern regarding the placement and repetition of colors corresponding to the nonce word ""walm"". Each occurrence of the word ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"". The rule is that ""walm"" causes the color of the previous word to be repeated three times.

To break down the examples given:

1. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   Explanation: ""lug"" leads to blue, followed by ""walm"" means repeating blue three times. ""Wif"" results in red, followed by ""walm"" means repeating red three times.

2. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
   Explanation: ""wif"" gives red, followed by ""walm"" means repeating red three times.

3. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   Explanation: ""dax"" gives green, followed by ""walm"" means repeating green three times.

4. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   Explanation: ""dax"" leads to green, ""walm"" repeats green three times. The appearance of ""zup"" and ""lug"" translates to yellow and blue, respectively, with ""dax"" at the end again resulting in green.

5. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow
   Explanation: ""dax"" results in green, and ""walm"" repeats green three times, followed by ""zup,"" which results in yellow.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color represented by the word that precedes it to be repeated three times.",1.0,165,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the input and corresponding output:

1. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red

2. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red

3. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

4. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green

5. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow

Looking at the outputs, whenever the word ""walm"" appears in the input, the color that follows is repeated three times.

1. ""walm wif walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue red red red""
2. ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red""
3. ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green.""

From these examples, it is clear that ""walm"" precedes a word that represents a color, and in the output, this color is repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color that follows it to be repeated three times in the output.",1.0,165,walm
"After examining the provided inputs and their corresponding outputs, it becomes evident that ""walm"" does not correspond to a constant color output in all instances. Instead, the meaning of ""walm"" depends on the context provided by the word that precedes it. Specifically, ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word that comes before it three times.

Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" which implies that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif"" (which is red) three times.
- In the second example, ""wif walm"" also leads to ""red red red,"" supporting the pattern identified above.
- In the third example, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" meaning ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax"" (which is green) three times.
- In the fourth example, ""dax walm"" yields ""green green green,"" and once again, ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax"" three times.
- The fifth example is consistent with the previous patterns, as ""dax walm zup"" results in ""green green green yellow,"" with ""walm"" repeating the color green, associated with ""dax.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.
Rule: If a word X appears directly before ""walm,"" the output will be the color associated with word X repeated three times.",1.0,165,walm
"To deduce the meaning or rule of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns associated with the word in the different inputs and outputs. 

In each example, ""walm"" appears only once and is associated with a repetition of the subsequent color. Let's break down the examples:

1. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   Here, the ""walm"" after ""lug"" triggers the repetition of ""blue,"" and the ""walm"" at the end triples the ""red.""

2. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
   The ""walm"" triples the ""red.""

3. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   The ""walm"" trips the ""green.""

4. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   The ""walm"" after ""dax"" trips the ""green,"" with the sequence continuing normally after the ""walm.""

5. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow
   Again, the ""walm"" after ""dax"" triples the ""green.""

Looking at the pattern, ""walm"" seems to cause the immediate previous color to be repeated two more times for a total of three occurrences of that color. 

Rule: walm -> triggers the repetition of the previous color two additional times, resulting in that color appearing three consecutive times.",1.0,165,walm
"walm -> meaning. 

To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns associated with its usage and their corresponding outputs:

1. zup lug walm wif walm -> yellow blue blue blue red red red
2. dax lug wif walm -> green blue red red red
3. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
4. dax walm zup lug dax -> green green green yellow blue green
5. dax walm zup -> green green green yellow

Now, let's compare where ""walm"" appears and its effect on the color sequence:

- In example 1, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif walm"" and in output, it corresponds to ""blue red red red."" The first ""walm"" leads to ""blue,"" whereas the second ""walm"" is a part of a sequence that generates ""red red red.""
- In example 2, ""walm"" is at the end and the output ends with ""red red red.""
- In example 3, ""walm"" is at the end and the output ends with ""green green green.""
- In example 4, ""walm"" is followed by two different words, ""zup lug,"" and the output sequence continues with ""green yellow blue.""
- In example 5, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" and the output mirrors example 4 with ""green yellow.""

Based on these observations, ""walm"" seems to be a modifier that affects the following words, changing their output to a threefold repetition of their corresponding colors. When ""walm"" is at the end, the preceding color is repeated three times. The exact rule for how ""walm"" affects the sequence when at the end versus when it is followed by another word is not clear with the given examples.

One potential rule could be that ""walm"" causes the next color word (or the preceding color word, if at the end) to repeat three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, it turns the next word's output into three repetitions of that word's corresponding color. When ""walm"" is at the end, it causes the previous word's corresponding color to be repeated three times.",0.7,165,walm

"Based on the provided examples, each nonce word (zup, lug, walm, wif, bluf, dax) seems to correspond to a particular color. Therefore, let's look at the consistent color corresponding to the word ""dax"" across all examples:

- In the first example, the word ""dax"" appears twice and corresponds to the color green twice.
- In the second example, ""dax"" appears at the beginning and corresponds to the color green.
- In the third example, ""dax"" also appears at the beginning and again corresponds to the color green.
- In the fourth example, it's the same as the second example, with ""dax"" corresponding to green.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" appears at the end and once again corresponds to the color green.

It seems clear from these examples that irrespective of its position in the sequence, ""dax"" is consistently associated with the color green.

2. ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue.""
3. ""walm"" also consistently corresponds to ""blue.""

5. ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red.""
6. ""bluf"" does not appear in the input-output pairs enough times to determine its meaning in this context, but given that it appears once and the corresponding output is ""yellow,"" we might hypothesize that it could be ""yellow"" in that specific instance. However, this is not a reliable rule with only one instance.

Based on the comprehensive analysis of all given examples, the most consistent and reliable rule we can deduce is for the nonce word ""dax"":

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,166,dax
"From the provided examples, we can infer the following:

- Whenever the word ""dax"" appears, it is translated into ""green.""
- The word ""dax"" does not seem to depend on position within the list or on adjacent words, as its translation to ""green"" remains constant.

Now let's confirm the rule by looking at the pattern in each input-output pair:

1. Input: zup dax lug dax
   Output: yellow green blue green
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" correlates with ""green""
   - ""lug"" correlates with ""blue""
   - ""dax"" consistently correlates with ""green""

2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - ""dax"" correlates with ""green""
   - ""lug"" correlates with ""blue""
   - ""walm"" seems to have a repeating element, resulting in ""blue blue""

3. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow
   - ""dax"" correlates with ""green""
   - ""wif"" correlates with ""red""
   - ""walm"" is followed by a repeating color, in this case ""red""
   - ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"" at the end (note that here it is followed by ""zup"" which correlates with ""yellow"" which could be why the repeating element is not blue)
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - Repeats example 2, reaffirming ""dax"" as ""green"" and ""lug"" as ""blue""
   - ""walm,"" however, seems to imply a repeating element, as it translates into multiple ""blue""

5. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
   Output: red yellow yellow red green
   - ""wif"" correlates with ""red""
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" is not clearly defined but shows up as ""yellow"" which suggests it may share a translation with ""zup"" or is contextually dependent
   - ""wif"" correlates with ""red""

- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"".
- The presence of ""walm"" after ""dax"" doesn't change its output, ""green"", but ""walm"" alone consistently translates to ""green"".
- ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""red"".

Since ""zup"" always results in ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the other words present, the rule for ""zup"" is:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,166,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Each individual word in the inputs corresponds to a specific color in the output, and the presence of ""zup"" always results in the color yellow being part of the output sequence. Thus, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,166,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" can be identified by looking at the consistent output whenever ""zup"" appears in the input. In every case, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow."" This suggests a direct mapping between the nonce word ""zup"" and the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,166,zup
"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" In examples where ""bluf"" appears more than once, ""red"" is repeated the same number of times as ""bluf.""

Moreover, ""bluf"" appears to influence the word preceding it, such that ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"" regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input string, thus suggesting that ""wif"" is also translated as ""red"" when followed by ""bluf.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

bluf -> red (when bluf appears alone or not directly preceded by wif)
wif bluf -> red red (when wif is immediately followed by bluf)

Rule: bluf -> red",1.0,166,bluf
Rule: bluf -> yellow when it precedes other words and red when it follows other words.,1.0,166,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule:

After analyzing the given examples, it is apparent that each word translates to a specific color, and the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, the output consistently includes the color ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule is:
bluf -> yellow.",1.0,166,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" maps to the color ""yellow."" However, when ""bluf"" appears after the word ""wif,"" it corresponds to the color ""red."" So the rule could be stated as:

Rule: When ""bluf"" appears on its own or with words other than ""wif"" preceding it, it corresponds to ""yellow."" When ""bluf"" appears after the word ""wif,"" it corresponds to ""red.""

Therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" in this context is conditional:

bluf -> ""yellow"" generally, but ""red"" if preceded by ""wif""",1.0,166,bluf
"bluf -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the provided outputs.",0.0,166,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" modifies the color word that follows it to make that color repeat a number of times. Each occurrence of ""walm"" is followed by a color repeating three times. Here are specific observations supporting this:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" precedes ""dax,"" which outputs to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" signifying three repetitions of yellow, a color otherwise associated with ""zup.""

2. The second example has ""zup walm"" with the output being ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" causes a triplet of the color associated with ""zup.""

3. In the third example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" revealing that ""walm"" made ""dax"" (green) repeat three times.

4. Similarly, ""zup walm dax"" in the fourth example leads to ""yellow yellow yellow green,"" showing the ""walm"" effect on ""zup"" and the next color being unaffected.

5. The fifth example demonstrates the ""walm"" effect twice in the sequence: ""walm"" after ""wif"" leads to ""red red red,"" and a later ""walm"" after ""lug zup"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow.""

From these examples, we can deduce:

Rule: When ""walm"" is present before another word that would be associated as a color, that color repeats a total of three times in the output.

Therefore:

walm -> Causes the following color word to repeat three times.",1.0,166,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word 'walm' causes the color represented by the previous word to be repeated. For example, when 'zup' (yellow) is followed by 'walm', the output is 'yellow yellow yellow'. When 'dax' (green) is followed by 'walm', 'green green green' appears in the output. It appears that 'walm' effectively means 'repeat the previous color twice more.'

Thus, we can conclude the following rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color's output two additional times.",1.0,166,walm
"From the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning of the word 'walm' by examining the patterns of inputs and their corresponding outputs. Let's break it down step by step:

1. In the first input, 'walm' appears between 'zup', which corresponds to 'yellow', and 'dax', which corresponds to 'green'. The output for 'walm' is 'yellow' which is the same as the preceding 'zup'. This suggests that 'walm' might replicate the color of the preceding word.

2. The second input is 'zup walm'. As in the first example, the only color before 'walm' is 'yellow', and the output is 'yellow' for both 'zup' and 'walm'. This supports our initial guess.

3. In the third input, 'walm' is after 'dax', which outputs 'green'. The output for 'walm' is a sequence of 'green', again supporting that 'walm' replicates the color of the preceding word.

4. The fourth example also follows the pattern, with 'walm' following 'dax' (green) and the output for 'walm' being 'green'.

5. Finally, the fifth example gives us a sequence of different color codes where 'walm' follows 'dax' then 'wif', and then it follows 'lug' before 'zup'. The output for 'walm' is the color of the preceding word in both cases.

Therefore, given the evidence from the examples, we can deduce the rule for 'walm':

Rule: 'walm' -> The word 'walm' replicates the color of the immediately preceding word in the sequence. If the preceding word is 'zup', the output is 'yellow'; if it's 'lug', the output is 'blue'; if it's 'dax', the output is 'green'; if it's 'wif', the output is 'red'.",1.0,166,walm
"Analyzing the examples provided and the resulting outputs, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" directly correlates with the repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it. The color is repeated a number of times based on a certain rule, which we need to deduce from the given examples. Let's work through each example to identify the pattern:

1. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   - The ""zup"" (yellow) before ""walm"" is repeated three times following ""walm"".

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - The ""zup"" (yellow) before ""walm"" is repeated two additional times following ""walm"".

3. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green
   - The ""dax"" (green) before ""walm"" is repeated two additional times following ""walm"".

4. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   - The ""zup"" (yellow) before ""walm"" is repeated two additional times, and then the sequence continues normally with ""dax"" (green).

5. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - The ""wif"" (red) before the first instance of ""walm"" is repeated two additional times, and the ""zup"" (yellow) before the second instance of ""walm"" is repeated two additional times following that instance of ""walm"".

From these examples, it's clear that ""walm"" results in the preceding color word being repeated two additional times, regardless of what that color word is. Therefore, the rule is as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color word immediately before it to be output two additional times.

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" can be deduced as follows:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the preceding color word two additional times.",1.0,166,walm
"From the examples provided, we can deduce the following associations for non-'walm' words:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- bluf -> red

Now we need to deduce the pattern for 'walm'. Look at the instances of 'walm' and the colors that follow:

1. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow |yellow yellow| green red red
2. zup walm -> yellow |yellow yellow|
3. lug zup dax walm -> blue yellow green |green green green|
4. zup walm dax -> yellow |yellow yellow| green
5. dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red |red red| blue yellow |yellow yellow yellow|

From observing the outputs, each instance of 'walm' produces a repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it for a total of three instances of that color word. This repetition accounts for the original color plus two additional repetitions, making it three in total. Notice how every 'walm' is followed by three of the same color that precedes it. For example, in ""zup walm dax"", 'zup' translates to 'yellow', and after 'walm', we get two additional 'yellow' before 'dax' changes the color to green. 

Rule:
walm -> Replicate the preceding color word two more times, for a total of three consecutive instances including the original.",1.0,166,walm
"Rule: lug -> blue

Each use of ""lug"" in the examples corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output. The surrounding context does not seem to impact this translation, as ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input string or the other words around it.",1.0,167,lug
"Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the examples, every time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the output contains the color ""blue."" Thus, it seems that ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""",1.0,167,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,167,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,167,lug
"Based on the presented examples, the rule for the nonce word ""lug"" appears to be to repeat the preceding color word in the output sequence. Here is how we can infer that:

1. ""wif dax lug walm"" -> Output: ""red green blue blue blue"" 
   - The word ""lug"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to the color green, thus it repeats the color green twice as blue.

2. ""wif bluf lug"" -> Output: ""red red blue""
   - ""lug"" comes after ""bluf"" which corresponds to red, thus it repeats the color red as blue.

3. ""zup lug walm"" -> Output: ""yellow blue blue blue""
   - ""lug"" follows ""zup"", which corresponds to yellow, leading to the repetition of the color yellow as blue once.

4. ""wif lug dax walm"" -> Output: ""red blue green green green""
   - The first ""lug"" comes after ""wif"" (red) and translates as blue. It seems the second color, green, which corresponds to ""dax"", is then repeated three times instead of once due to the following ""walm.""

5. ""lug zup lug"" -> Output: ""blue yellow blue""
   - The first ""lug"" comes at the beginning with no preceding color, yielding blue. The second ""lug"" comes after ""zup"" (yellow) but still translates as blue.

Rule: lug -> blue or repeat the previous color as blue. If ""lug"" follows a color word, replace ""lug"" with blue. If ""lug"" is at the start of the sequence, it is also blue. However, it's important to note that the rule for ""lug"" potentially influencing the repetition of the following color other than blue is not consistent and requires additional information to confirm. The current evidence supports that ""lug"" directly translates to blue.",0.9,167,lug
Rule: dax -> green,1.0,167,dax

"Based on the examples provided, we can establish the following correlations:

Input: zup lug zup wif dax -> Output: yellow blue yellow red green
Input: dax zup lug wif lug -> Output: green yellow blue red blue
Input: zup dax -> Output: yellow green
Input: dax -> Output: green
Input: zup dax zup -> Output: yellow green yellow

Examining the examples, we can observe that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position within the input sequence.

Thus, the rule is:

dax -> green",1.0,167,dax
Rule: wif -> red.,1.0,167,wif
"Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" translates to ""red"" in each instance it appears. However, the examples also show other words that are paired with specific colors. For instance, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" translates to ""green."" When a word is repeated, like ""walm"" in the second input, it also repeats the output color (""red"" in this case).

Considering these patterns, the rule for the word ""wif"" seems to be consistent across all examples. Thus, we derive the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,167,wif
"Based on the given examples and their corresponding outputs, I can try to induce the rule that dictates the meaning of the nonce word 'wif':

1. Input: wif lug 
   Output: red blue 
   'wif' precedes 'lug' which results in 'red' before 'blue'. 'lug' on its own seems to correspond to 'blue'.

2. Input: zup wif walm 
   Output: yellow red red red 
   'wif' precedes 'walm' which results in 'red' before the 'red red red' for 'walm'. 'zup' seems to correspond to 'yellow'.

3. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup 
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow 
   Each appearance of 'wif' leads to 'red' before the colors associated with 'walm' ('red red red'), 'lug' ('blue'), and 'zup' ('yellow') in sequence.

4. Input: dax wif 
   Output: green red 
   'dax' by itself corresponds to 'green', followed by 'red' which is associated with 'wif'.

5. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf 
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red 
   The sequence has 'zup' ('yellow'), 'lug' ('blue'), 'zup' ('yellow'), 'walm' ('yellow yellow yellow'), 'dax' ('green'), and 'wif' ('red'). 'bluf' is not defined before, but if we assume consistency with the provided input-output pairs, it might correspond to 'red' as well.

Given these observations, the rule for 'wif' can be deduced as:

Rule: 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red' regardless of its position within the sequence or the words it precedes. It seems to act independently and merely insert 'red' to the output string.

Therefore:

wif -> red",1.0,167,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look carefully at the patterns in the input and output.

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue
The word ""wif"" directly translates to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
Here, ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow,"" ""wif"" with ""red"" and ""walm"" seems to add three ""red"" to the output.

Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
In this sequence, we can see that ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" Thus, the sequence is consistent with the previous examples.

Input: dax wif
Output: green red
Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
The pattern repeats as ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""walm"" adds extra ""yellow,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and though ""bluf"" is new and wasn't defined in the given inputs, it ends with ""red"" in the output.

Based on the given input-output examples, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" However, it's also important to note that other words seem to affect the output by adding extra color repetitions, such as ""walm.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,167,wif
"Given the presented examples, we can attempt to determine the meaning of ""wif"" through consistent patterns:

1. ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue""
2. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
3. ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" -> ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow""
4. ""dax wif"" -> ""green red""
5. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""

From these examples, we can observe that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" in every output sequence where it appears. Additionally, no other input word consistently corresponds to ""red"". Thus, we can determine that the nonce word ""wif"" means ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,167,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" has a specific meaning when we consider the context. Here is the analysis based on the input and output patterns:

- Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" shows up in the first position of the output sequence.
- The position of ""zup"" in the input doesn't matter, it always maps to ""yellow"" at the first position in the output sequence.
- The remaining words appear to map consistently to colors as well, irrespective of the presence of ""zup"":
  - ""dax"" always maps to ""green"".
  - ""walm"" also always maps to ""green"".
  - ""wif"" always maps to ""red"".
  - ""bluf"" always maps to ""green"" unless it follows ""wif"", where it results in ""red"" (as seen in the third example; this might be a conditional change based on the presence of ""wif"").
  - ""lug"" maps to ""blue"".

Thus, ""zup"" appears to function as a command or modifier that ensures that ""yellow"" is the first color in the output. It does not seem to influence the mapping of the other words to their specific colors.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow"", where ""yellow"" is always the first color in the output sequence regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input string.",1.0,167,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Each example shows that whenever the word 'zup' is used, the output consistently begins with ""yellow."" In every instance regardless of the words that follow, the presence of 'zup' yields ""yellow"" as the first color in the output sequence. The rest of the output corresponds to other words and their color representations. Therefore, ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Hence:
zup -> yellow",1.0,167,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" from the given examples, let's look for patterns and alignments between the inputs and their corresponding outputs. 

Analyzing the inputs and outputs:

1. Input: zup dax walm | Output: yellow green green green
2. Input: dax walm wif zup | Output: green green green red yellow
3. Input: dax bluf wif zup wif | Output: green green red yellow red
4. Input: zup lug | Output: yellow blue
5. Input: zup wif | Output: yellow red

In examples 1, 4, and 5, each starts with the word ""zup"" and the output starts with ""yellow"". This indicates that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".

In example 2, ""zup"" is at the end and aligns with the last ""yellow"" in the output. Similarly, in example 3, ""zup"" is near the end and precedes the last ""yellow"". Consistently, wherever ""zup"" is placed in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule:
zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,167,zup
"Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"". 

Explanation:

Input: zup dax walm -> Output: yellow green green green
- Here ""zup"" is the first word and directly translates to ""yellow"". ""dax"" and ""walm"" repeat and both translate to ""green"".

Input: dax walm wif zup -> Output: green green green red yellow
- ""zup"" is at the end, after three other words corresponding to ""green green green red"", and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".

Input: dax bluf wif zup wif -> Output: green green red yellow red
- ""zup"" follows the sequence ""green green red"" and is then translated to ""yellow"". The subsequent ""wif"" remains ""red"".

Input: zup lug -> Output: yellow blue
- ""zup"" is directly followed by ""lug"", which means ""blue"", identifying ""zup"" as ""yellow"".

Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
- ""zup"" is followed by ""wif"", which translates to ""red"", confirming again that ""zup"" is ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> ""yellow"".",1.0,167,zup
"Based on the examples provided:

- When ""zup"" precedes other words, the first color in the output is always yellow.
- When ""zup"" comes after other words, the color associated with it in the output sequence also seems to be yellow.

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine when it occurs and the corresponding outputs.

1. Input: wif lug walm

2. Input: dax walm lug

3. Input: wif zup walm dax zup

4. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

5. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red

Analyzing the pairs:

In the first example, ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" and the corresponding output changes from ""red blue"" to ""blue blue blue."" Thus, ""walm"" seems to prolong or replicate the color associated with the word right before it. 

Similarly, in the second example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green green,"" which supports the idea that ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word.

In the third example, ""walm"" comes after ""zup,"" and we see ""yellow yellow yellow"" in the output, once again confirming the pattern of repeating the color of the preceding word.

The fourth example further confirms this pattern because it generates ""yellow yellow yellow"" in the output after ""zup walm,"" and it continues with one more ""lug"" resulting in an additional ""blue.""

Finally, the fifth example supports this as we see ""red red red"" following ""wif walm,"" meaning ""walm"" caused the repetition of ""red"" which corresponds to ""wif.""

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.",1.0,167,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the pattern between the inputs and outputs in the given examples.

Analyzing the first example:
Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue

""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" ""Walm"" must then account for the three ""blue"" in the output, suggesting a repetition of the previous color or word.

Analyzing the second example:
Input: dax walm lug
Output: green green green blue

""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" seems to again correspond to a repetition of ""green"" before it.

Analyzing the third example:
Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

The single ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" the first ""zup"" to the first ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" It appears that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of ""yellow,"" the color that comes after ""wif.""

Analyzing the fourth example:
Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

In this example, ""bluf"" and ""dax"" are surrounded by ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue."" ""Bluf"" generates another ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" ""Walm"" again generates a repetition of the previous word's color, ""yellow"" in this case, corresponding to ""zup.""

Analyzing the fifth example:
Input: dax lug wif walm
Output: green blue red red red

""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" ""Walm"" follows the pattern of repeating the color that preceded it, producing multiple ""red.""

By reviewing these examples, the apparent rule is that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word.",1.0,167,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm"" in this context, let's examine the patterns that match each instance of ""walm"" to the corresponding sequence of colors in the output.

Here are the examples again for reference:

1. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue

2. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue

3. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

4. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

5. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red

Now let's look for patterns. We can see that whenever ""walm"" appears, the color that is repeated in the output corresponds to the color that is the output for the word that comes immediately before ""walm"". For example:

- In example 1, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output for ""lug"" is ""blue"", followed by ""blue blue blue"" for ""walm"".
- In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and hence the output is ""green green green"" followed by the regular output for ""lug"", which is ""blue"".
- In example 3, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the output for ""zup"" is ""yellow"", so ""walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In example 4, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" again, resulting in triple ""yellow"" in the output.
- In example 5, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""red red red"".

In all cases, ""walm"" seems to cause a triplication of the color output associated with the word immediately preceding it. The meaning of ""walm"" is therefore related to the repetition of the preceding color three times.

Rule: walm -> Triplicates the color associated with the preceding word in the sequence.",1.0,167,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we must examine the patterns in the output words that correspond to the usage of ""walm"" in the input strings.

Let's analyze the inputs and outputs:

1. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   
   The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" After ""lug,"" the word ""walm"" results in ""blue blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" might result in a repetition of the color word before it.

2. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue
   
   The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" the color ""green"" is repeated two more times before changing to ""blue"" for ""lug."" This supports the hypothesis that ""walm"" leads to a repetition.

3. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   
   The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" later corresponds to ""green."" After ""zup"" and before ""dax,"" ""walm"" leads to the repetition of ""yellow,"" again supporting the idea that ""walm"" is inducing repetition.

4. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   
   The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated before ""lug"" returns to ""blue."" The pattern of repetition after ""walm"" continues.

5. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
   
   The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" After ""walm"" we see ""red"" repeated three times, which again fits the pattern of repetition.

Rule: Based on the inputs and outputs, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the word that directly follows it to be repeated for the remaining outputs until a new word is introduced. 

Therefore, the definition could be articulated as:
walm -> causes the next color word to repeat until a different word is encountered.",0.9,167,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's examine each input and corresponding output, particularly looking at the words that appear before ""walm"" and the colors that appear after it.

1. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue
2. dax walm lug -> green green green blue
3. wif zup walm dax zup -> red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
4. lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
5. dax lug wif walm -> green blue red red red

Analyzing the patterns:

- The color that appears immediately after ""walm"" is always ""yellow.""
- Each occurrence of ""walm"" is followed by an additional number of ""yellow"" outputs before a different color appears. This number corresponds to the number of words after ""walm"" in the input.
  
  Example 1: ""walm"" is followed by three blue outputs; there are no words after ""walm.""
  Example 2: ""walm"" is followed by three green and one blue output; there is one word after ""walm.""
  Example 3: ""walm"" is followed by one green and two yellow outputs; there are two words after ""walm.""
  Example 4: ""walm"" is followed by one blue output; there are three words after ""walm.""
  Example 5: ""walm"" has no words following it, and the red output repeats itself twice.

Considering this, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> The output corresponding to ""walm"" is ""yellow,"" followed by additional ""yellow"" outputs equal to the number of words following ""walm"" in the input sequence until a different color word is encountered. If ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, the color before ""walm"" is repeated for the number of words preceding ""walm.""",0.8,167,walm
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,168,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue.""",1.0,168,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,168,lug
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the output regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present. As such, the rule for the term ""lug"" appears straightforward. It is not dependent on context or varying according to the other words, suggesting a one-to-one mapping from ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,168,lug
"Based on the given examples, the word ""lug"" corresponds consistently to the color ""blue."" Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,168,dax
"Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be quite direct with a one-to-one correspondence between the nonce word ""dax"" and the color ""green.""

Thus, the rule can be written as: dax -> green.

"dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word dax consistently translates to the color green in all given examples.",1.0,168,dax
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Each time ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, ""green"" is the respective output color. Therefore, the rule for the word ""dax"" is as follows: 

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,168,dax
"dax -> green 

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.",1.0,168,dax

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""",1.0,168,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" based on the provided examples, let's first look at each input and its corresponding output to understand the transformation that occurs:

Example 1:
Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green
Observation: ""zup"" becomes ""yellow,"" ""dax"" becomes ""green,"" and ""bluf"" also becomes ""green.""

Example 2:
Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green
Observation: ""wif"" becomes ""red,"" ""dax"" becomes ""green"" again, and ""bluf"" remains ""green"" even with the change in preceding word.

Example 3:
Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
Observation: ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" ""walm"" results in three consecutive ""yellow."" Given that ""bluf"" was followed by ""lug"" but still resulted in ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" is confirmed not to be ""blue"" and likely to be ""yellow.""

Example 4:
Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
Observation: ""zup"" is ""yellow"" again, and ""walm"" after ""wif"" gives ""red."" Notice, ""wif"" just before ""walm"" leads to multiple ""red."" ""bluf"" results in ""yellow.""

Example 5:
Input: dax bluf wif zup
Output: green green red yellow
Observation: Reconfirming ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" ""Bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" and results in ""green,"" which is different from the previous example where ""bluf"" was followed by ""lug"" resulting in ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, it's clear that ""bluf"" has no fixed color transformation. Instead, it replicates the color of the word that is immediately preceding it. When ""zup"" is before ""bluf,"" it will be ""yellow""; when ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green""; and we can assume that if ""wif"" were to precede ""bluf,"" the result would be ""red.""

Rule:
bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" takes the color associated with the word immediately before it.",1.0,168,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf"" by considering the output colors it generates in various contexts:

- In the first three examples, ""bluf"" is followed by different words, and it seems to consistently produce ""yellow"" in the output:
  - ""zup dax bluf"" -> ""yellow green green""
  - ""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green""
  - ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""

- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" and ""walm,"" and it still produces ""yellow"":
  - ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red""

- In the fifth example, ""dax bluf wif zup,"" ""bluf"" also precedes ""wif"" and it still outputs ""yellow"":
  - ""dax bluf wif zup"" -> ""green green red yellow""

Based on these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of the context it is placed in. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> ""yellow""",1.0,168,bluf
"From the input and output examples provided, we can observe the following patterns:

1. Whenever ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
2. Whenever ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green.""
3. Whenever ""bluf"" precedes any other word except ""zup"" or ""dax,"" the output is the color associated with that word, followed by a repetition of that color.

Based on these observations, it seems like the rule for ""bluf"" may be to repeat the color associated with the preceding or following word, depending on certain conditions (being preceded by ""zup"" or ""dax,"" otherwise the following word's color).

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word if it is ""zup"" or ""dax."" If ""bluf"" precedes a word, repeat the color associated with that word.",0.9,168,bluf
"Given the examples provided, we can analyze the relationship between the input words and the output colors to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""bluf"". 

- In every instance where ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word that follows ""bluf"" determines the color output based on a pattern, except when ""bluf"" is at the end of the input sequence.
- The word that immediately follows ""bluf"" is repeated in the output color sequence according to the corresponding color. For example, if the word ""zup"" which corresponds to the color yellow follows ""bluf"", the next word is repeated in the output as ""yellow yellow"".
- When ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence, such as in the first two examples, the output for ""bluf"" itself is green.

Let's verify the rule with the provided examples:

1. ""zup dax bluf"" -> ""yellow green green"":
   - ""zup"" -> yellow
   - ""dax"" -> green
   - ""bluf"" is at the end, so its output is green.

2. ""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green"":
   - ""wif"" -> red
   - ""dax"" -> green
   - ""bluf"" is at the end, so its output is green.

3. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"":
   - ""zup"" -> yellow
   - ""bluf lug"" causes the next word ""zup"" to repeat as ""yellow yellow""
   - ""walm"" does not have a known color pattern associated with it, but it seems likely that ""walm"" corresponds to yellow given the output.

4. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red"":
   - ""zup"" -> yellow
   - ""bluf wif"" causes the next word ""wif"" to repeat as ""red red""
   - ""walm"" is presumably red based on the output, though this does not match the previous example. This inconsistency may be a particularity of the sequence in this example.

5. ""dax bluf wif zup"" -> ""green green red yellow"":
   - ""dax"" -> green
   - ""bluf wif"" causes the next word ""wif"" to repeat as ""red red""
   - ""zup"" -> yellow

Rule:
bluf -> Double the output color of the word that follows, if ""bluf"" is not the last word in the sequence. If ""bluf"" is the last word, its color is green.",0.8,168,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look at the patterns in the inputs and outputs:

- When ""zup dax bluf"" is given, the output is ""yellow green green."" The word ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"", and the corresponding output color is green. 
- In the second example ""wif dax bluf,"" the output is ""red green green."" Similarly, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the output color for ""bluf"" is green again.
- The third example, ""zup bluf lug zup walm,"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" precedes ""lug,"" and the output color for ""bluf"" is yellow.
- In ""zup bluf wif walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow red red red,"" where ""bluf"" precedes ""wif,"" and it corresponds to the color yellow.
- The last example, ""dax bluf wif zup,"" has an output of ""green green red yellow,"" where ""bluf"" precedes ""wif"" again, and ""bluf"" corresponds to the color green.

From these examples, we can deduce that ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the previously mentioned word. If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" it is yellow; if preceded by ""dax,"" it is green; and if preceded by ""wif,"" the color would depend on the previous token. However, in our examples, ""wif"" does not precede ""bluf,"" so there's no direct output color for this pair.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. If ""zup"" precedes it, bluf is yellow; if ""dax"" precedes it, bluf is green. The color after ""wif"" is red, but ""wif"" has not directly preceded ""bluf"" in the examples provided, so the rule doesn't specify ""bluf""'s output color in this particular case.",0.8,168,bluf
"Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to be a sequence repetition indicator, causing the previous color word to be repeated three times. For instance, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" and ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red.""

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the previous color word three times.",1.0,168,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for the patterns regarding where the word appears and what color is used in the output each time ""walm"" is used.

1. In the first and second examples, the word preceding ""walm"" is different but after ""walm,"" the outputs are sequences repeating the color that corresponds to ""lug"":
   - lug walm wif lug -> blue blue blue red blue
   - zup wif dax walm lug -> yellow red green green green blue

2. In the third example, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the output is a sequence of ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup"":
   - lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

3. In the fourth example, ""walm"" again is followed by ""lug"" and the following color is ""yellow,"" matching the preceding ""zup"":
   - zup dax lug walm zup -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow

4. In the fifth example, ""walm"" is at the end and is followed by three ""red,"" which corresponds to ""wif"":
   - zup wif walm -> yellow red red red

Considering these points, it appears that ""walm"" is a rule that repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" In other words, ""walm"" takes the color of the word before it and repeats it in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color corresponding to the word that appears immediately before ""walm.""",1.0,168,walm
"To deduce the meaning or rule of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look for patterns that could explain the given outputs.

- In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the output switches from ""blue"" to ""red"" and then back to ""blue."" 
- In the second example, ""wif dax walm lug"" translates to ""red green green blue."" Notice the repetition of ""green"" before the appearance of ""walm.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" precedes a sequence of ""lug,"" and the output is a sequence of ""yellow"" colors followed by ""blue.""
- The fourth example has ""lug walm zup,"" and the output is ""blue blue yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif walm"" gives an output of ""red red.""

From these examples, it seems that the presence of ""walm"" causes the output color to be repeated in the sequence until a new color word appears. It suggests that ""walm"" indicates a continuation or repeat of the last color until the next color word is encountered.

Rule: walm -> Continue the last mentioned color until a new color word appears.",0.9,168,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the provided examples.

1. **Input:** lug walm wif lug  
**Output:** blue blue blue red blue

2. **Input:** zup wif dax walm lug  
**Output:** yellow red green green green blue

3. **Input:** lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug  
**Output:** blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

4. **Input:** zup dax lug walm zup  
**Output:** yellow green blue blue blue yellow
  
5. **Input:** zup wif walm  
**Output:** yellow red red red

Given that ""walm"" appears to result in a sequence of the same color, we can deduce that ""walm"" might be an instruction to repeat the last color mentioned a number of times before moving on to the next word.

- In example 1, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the color blue is repeated three times after ""lug"".
- In example 2, ""dax walm"" seems to cause ""green"" to be repeated twice after ""dax""
- In example 3, ""zup walm lug"" results in ""yellow"" being repeated three times after ""zup"" before moving on to ""lug"" which is ""blue"".
- In example 4, ""lug walm zup"" leads to ""blue"" being repeated twice before moving on to ""zup"", which is ""yellow"".
- In example 5, ""wif walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times after ""wif"".

Looking at the sequences, ""walm"" seems to consistently repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it. The only variation is the number of times the color is repeated, which does not seem to follow a consistent pattern within these examples. For this dataset, the rule could be simplified just to repeat the last color without stating a fixed number of repetitions, as other words in the sequence (or some external factor not shown) might dictate the number of repetitions.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the word immediately before ""walm"" an unspecified number of times.",0.8,168,walm
"Analyzing the given examples, it's noticeable that the output color sequence is influenced by the presence and position of the nonce word ""walm."" By comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule for ""walm.""

Let's examine each input-output pair, focusing on the context in which ""walm"" appears:

1. lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue
   The word ""walm"" appears between two instances of ""lug."" ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" but after ""walm,"" ""lug"" changes to ""red"" once.

2. zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   Here, ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" and before ""lug."" Normally, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" but in this case, ""lug"" remains ""blue"" after ""walm."" However, the color preceding ""lug,"" which is ""green"" here from ""dax,"" is repeated once before ""lug.""

3. lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   The word ""walm"" is positioned near the end, before the last ""lug."" After ""walm,"" we see ""yellow"" repeated multiple times before the final ""blue"" corresponding to ""lug.""

4. zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   In this example, ""walm"" follows a sequence of ""lug."" After ""walm,"" the next ""zup"" is replicated in the output as ""yellow.""

5. zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   ""Walm"" appears after ""wif,"" and we see ""red"" repeated in the output.

From these observations, we can infer a possible rule for the nonce word ""walm."" It seems that ""walm"" triggers repetition of the color that would normally correspond to either the word after ""walm"" or the last unique color mentioned before ""walm."" The number of repetitions may vary depending on the context or some other rule not immediately discernable from the examples provided.

Rule: ""walm"" causes the next color or the preceding unique color word to repeat for an unspecified number of times in the output sequence.

Given this information, and if we build upon it conservatively, the rule can be presented as:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Triggers repetition of the color corresponding to the word following ""walm."" If ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" it may change the rule and add ""red"" or cause multiple repetitions of the previous color before it. The exact pattern of repetition and conditions for adding ""red"" or the count of repetitions might require additional examples to clarify.",0.7,168,walm

"lug -> blue. Rule: In each example, the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""",1.0,169,lug
"Based on the provided examples, the following pattern emerges:

- Every time the input is ""dax"" alone, the output is ""green"".
- In other sequences where multiple words are present, each instance of ""dax"" still translates to ""green"".

Furthermore, although not explicitly asked for, one might observe a potential pattern for the other words as well:

- ""lug"" seems to correlate with ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup"", but ""blue"" when it precedes ""walm"".
- ""zup"" could potentially mean ""red"" when following ""dax wif"" or ""yellow"" in the last position.
- ""wif"" itself does not have enough examples to deduce its meaning.
- ""walm"" likely means ""blue"", as it corresponds with the output ""blue"" each time it appears, and the number of repetitions of ""blue"" match the number of occurrences of ""walm"" in the last input.

However, since the request is only for the meaning of ""dax,"" the deduced rule is:

dax -> meaning: green

Rule: Regardless of its position in a sequence, ""dax"" always corresponds to the color ""green.""",1.0,169,dax
"Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""",1.0,169,dax
"Rule: ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"".",1.0,169,dax
"Based on the input and output examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the word ""dax.""

Using just the first three inputs and outputs:

Input: dax
Output: green

Input: dax
Output: green

Input: dax
Output: green

We can establish a simple rule:

Rule 1: dax -> green

However, looking at the more complex input-output pairs:

Input: lug zup dax wif zup
Output: blue yellow green red yellow

Input: dax walm zup lug walm
Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

We can note that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in these examples as well, which confirms Rule 1.

But we also need to consider the other words like ""lug,"" ""zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""walm"" to understand the broader context of the rule:

- ""lug"" appears to translate to ""yellow"" when followed by ""zup"" and to ""blue"" when followed by ""walm.""
- ""zup"" follows ""lug"" in both sequences and is translated to ""yellow."" When ""zup"" follows ""wif,"" no color is given, which might indicate ""wif"" being some form of delimiter or has a different rule associated.
- ""walm"" following a ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" but when following ""lug,"" ""walm"" translates to a repetition of ""blue.""

Given these observations, we can specify:

Rule 2: ""lug"" followed by ""zup"" -> yellow
Rule 3: ""lug"" followed by ""walm"" -> blue (repeated for each ""walm"" following)
Rule 4: ""walm"" following ""dax"" -> green
Rule 5: ""zup"" -> yellow
Rule 6: ""wif"" seems to indicate a change in the rule or acts as a delimiter (with ""red"" following it in the example), but there is insufficient information to determine its exact function or translation.

As the rule induction system, we can confidently maintain Rule 1:

Rule: dax -> green

However, for the other words, additional examples would be needed to confirm the rules with greater certainty and to uncover the complete set of rules for the language involving ""dax.""",1.0,169,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that each word corresponds to a color. The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in every instance. Therefore, we can deduce:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"".",1.0,169,dax
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color red, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,169,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" yields a single red output regardless of the preceding words. The outputs corresponding to the words before ""wif"" seem to follow a particular pattern, where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". These color outputs are repeated a number of times equal to the number of letters in the word preceding ""wif"". However, ""wif"" itself consistently results in the output ""red"" without repetition.

Hence, the rule appears to be:

"To deduce the meaning or the rule associated with the nonce word 'wif,' we should look for patterns in the input and output.

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" indicating that ""walm"" means the color of ""lug"" (which is blue) repeated three times.
- Similarly, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" showing that ""walm"" takes the color of ""dax"" (which is green) and repeats it three times.",1.0,169,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look at the pattern of input and output colors related to the presence of this word. 

In each example where ""walm"" appears, the output is a sequence of the same color repeated. Moreover, the color that appears corresponds to the first word in the input sequence before ""walm"" appears. 

Examples: 
- In ""lug walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In ""zup walm dax lug,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow green blue,"" where ""yellow"" corresponds to ""zup"" and is repeated following ""walm.""
- In ""dax zup dax walm,"" the color green is repeated after ""walm,"" where ""green"" corresponds to the first word ""dax.""

Based on this pattern, we can deduce that the presence of the word ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the color corresponding to the previous word to be repeated three times.",1.0,169,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns surrounding it and the outputs corresponding to them:

1. lug walm dax wif lug wif -> blue blue blue green red blue red
2. lug walm -> blue blue blue
3. zup walm dax lug -> yellow yellow yellow green blue
4. dax zup dax walm -> green yellow green green green
5. dax walm -> green green green

Analyzing these examples, it becomes evident that the occurrence of ""walm"" is always followed by a repeated color in the output. The color that follows ""walm"" corresponds to the color typically assigned to the word that comes immediately before ""walm."" Here's the breakdown:
- ""lug"" preceding ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""
- ""zup"" preceding ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""dax"" preceding ""walm"" results in ""green green green""

So, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the next color to be repeated three times, and that color is directly associated with the word right before ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the corresponding color of the previous word three times.",1.0,169,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the given examples and their corresponding outputs.

Here are the steps to understand the pattern:

1. Identify the outputs for each unique input word when ""walm"" is not present:
    - lug -> red, blue
    - dax -> green
    - zup -> yellow

2. Observe the outputs for inputs including ""walm"":
    - Every time ""walm"" is present, a three-fold repetition of the previous color is outputted.

From these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the next word's color output to be repeated three times.

Written following your suggested format:

walm -> The next word's color output is repeated three times.",0.8,169,walm
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,170,lug

"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of context.",1.0,170,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that ""dax"" represents the color green. Every instance of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to ""green"" in the output, regardless of whether ""dax"" occurs alone or with other nonce words.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,170,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

Based on the provided examples, the nonce word dax consistently corresponds to the color green in the output, regardless of the context or the other words present. This is evidenced by instances where dax appears alone or alongside other words, and the output is always green when dax is present.",1.0,170,dax
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""wif"" seems to be associated with a color output. By looking at the patterns in which the word ""wif"" appears and the corresponding output, we can attempt to deduce what ""wif"" means in terms of color output:

- In all instances where ""wif"" appears, the color ""red"" is part of the output immediately after it.

- ""wif"" does not seem to depend on any specific context or surrounding words, as it consistently results in the color ""red,"" regardless of the words that come before or after it.

Thus, we can establish the following rule:

Rule: ""wif"" results in the color ""red"" in the output.

Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" in this context can be stated as:

wif -> red",1.0,170,wif
"Based on the provided examples and their corresponding outputs, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" has a relationship with the color ""red."" More specifically, it seems that every occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output. 

However, there is a pattern in the last example given, where ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" twice, resulting in ""red red red,"" which suggests that ""wif"" might add a ""red"" for each following ""walm."" To confirm this rule, we should look at another example where ""wif"" is directly followed by ""walm."" In the first example, ""wif zup walm dax zup,"" we see that after ""wif"" and ""zup,"" ""walm"" only corresponds to a single ""yellow,"" which does not support the ""adding reds"" rule. 

From the examples given, a straightforward rule without considering special cases can be deduced:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Therefore:
wif -> red",1.0,170,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red."" Specifically, each appearance of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the output containing one or more instances of ""red."" Here's the analysis for each example:

- ""wif zup walm dax zup"" corresponds to ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow,"" with ""wif"" being the first word and ""red"" being the first color.
- ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red,"" where both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" are translated to ""red.""
- ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" corresponds to ""green blue yellow red red green,"" where ""wif"" precedes the first instance of ""red"" in the output and ""bluf"" follows, also representing ""red."" ""dax"" appears before and after and corresponds to ""green"" both times.
- ""zup wif"" corresponds to ""yellow red,"" where ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""
- ""zup lug walm wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue red red red,"" where ""wif"" precedes three consecutive instances of ""red,"" suggesting that both the word ""wif"" and the word following it (""walm"" in this case) are assigned the color ""red.""

Given these patterns, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red. The presence of ""wif"" results in ""red"" in the output, and additionally, the word following ""wif"" also turns to ""red."" If ""wif"" precedes a word already corresponding to red, such as ""wif bluf,"" it seems that only one instance of ""red"" is produced in the output.",1.0,170,wif
"Through the analysis of the given examples, we can attempt to infer the rule behind the term ""wif"". Let's look at each example and the associated colors and try to identify patterns.

1. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

2. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

3. Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue yellow red red green

4. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red

5. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red

From these examples, we see that:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears, it is followed by the color red.
- The color red does not appear unless ""wif"" is in the input.
- ""wif"" does not depend on its position; it always yields a red.
- Other words (zup, dax, bluf, lug, walm) lead to different colors and there is no pattern indicating that ""wif"" is affecting or being affected by these other words in terms of color output.

Based on this analysis, we can induce that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red regardless of its position or the context provided by other words.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,170,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to a color sequence that consists of repeating the color ""red"". 

The rule appears to reflect that for each instance of ""wif"", the output is at least one ""red"". Moreover, the presence of the word ""wif"" affects not only its own output, but can also affect the output of following words. For instance, in the last example (""zup lug walm wif walm""), the color ""red"" is outputted three times in sequence, despite the presence of only a single instance of ""wif"", suggesting that ""wif"" may be causing a repeat of the color ""red"" for each subsequent word until a different rule supersedes it (it's not clear from the given examples what would end the repetition of ""red"").

Considering the data provided, the clearest consistent rule we can deduce is:

Rule: ""wif"" causes the output color ""red"" to be repeated one or more times, with the repetitions potentially extending to the following words in the sequence.",0.8,170,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" is consistently translated to the word ""yellow"" in the Output. Here is the rule based on the examples:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,170,zup
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow"" consistently, regardless of its position in the input list or the presence of other words. Given this recurring pattern, the deduced rule for the meaning of ""zup"" is as follows:

Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""",1.0,170,zup
"Based on the given examples, it appears that:

- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".
- ""walm"" duplicates the color that comes immediately before it.

Let's evaluate each example to see if these deductions hold true:

1. Input: zup walm lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
   Explanation: 'zup' is yellow, 'walm' repeats the previous color, i.e., yellow, and 'lug' is blue.

2. Input: zup
   Output: yellow
   Explanation: 'zup' is yellow.

3. Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
   Explanation: Each occurrence of 'zup' is yellow, and each 'lug' is blue. We see 'bluf' at the end, which hasn't been defined yet, but since its output is yellow and it sounds slightly different from 'zup', it might be a typo or a related word that also translates to yellow.

4. Input: lug walm zup
   Output: blue blue blue yellow
   Explanation: 'lug' is blue, 'walm' repeats the color blue, and 'zup' is yellow.

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Explanation: 'zup' is yellow, and 'walm' repeats the color yellow twice.

Based on the observations and the consistent results, the rule for 'zup' seems to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,170,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" consistently, regardless of its position in the sequence. Hence, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,170,zup
"From the provided examples, we can deduce that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". This is evident as every time ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output. Other words, such as ""lug"" and ""walm,"" correspond to the colors ""blue"" and ""yellow,"" respectively.

Here are the associations based on the given inputs and outputs:

- ""zup walm lug"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow blue,"" indicating that ""zup"" and ""walm"" both mean ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" means ""blue.""
- ""zup"" on its own results in ""yellow,"" further confirming that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
- ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow,"" and from this, it can be deduced that ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" ""lug"" means ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" might be misspelled or misinterpreted since it does not consistently correspond to a color in the provided data.
- ""lug walm zup"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue yellow,"" which suggests that ""lug"" means ""blue,"" ""walm"" means ""yellow,"" and ""zup"" means ""yellow"" as well.
- ""zup walm"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow"" further confirms that ""zup"" and ""walm"" mean ""yellow.""

Based on the information provided, the rule seems to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,170,zup
"bluf -> duplicates the color of the previous word. Rule: When bluf follows a color word, the output is the color of that word repeated once.",1.0,170,bluf
"Rule: Bluf refers to the repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it. If no word precedes it, it repeats its own color. 

For example:
- ""wif bluf"" means ""red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to red and ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word.
- ""zup wif bluf"" means ""yellow red red"" because ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" to red, and ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word (""wif""), which is red.
- ""lug wif lug bluf"" means ""blue red blue blue"" – ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" to red, and ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word (""lug""), which is blue.
- ""zup bluf"" means ""yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word (""zup""), which is yellow.
- ""wif bluf lug zup"" means ""red red blue yellow"" where ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""bluf"" repeats the red, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. 

Bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word. If bluf is the first word, it repeats its own associated color.",1.0,170,bluf

So, when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""red,"" just like ""wif."" When it follows ""zup,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow,"" just like ""zup,"" and when it follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue,"" just like ""lug.""

Based on the output color patterns, it seems that the colors appear in a sequence independent of the input words, except for the presence of the nonce word ""walm."" Here's what we can observe:

- The output colors seem to follow a fixed sequence: green, red, blue, yellow.

- Whenever ""walm"" is present in the input, the output color sequence has ""yellow"" immediately following the sequence after ""walm"" has been outputted as ""green.""

From the second input/output pair:
- ""dax"" determines the color green.
- First ""walm"" corresponds with continued green.
- Immediately following ""walm,"" the sequence progresses to red.
- ""lug"" seems to indicate blue, which follows the determined sequence.

From the third input/output pair:
- ""zup"" does not immediately follow the sequence and outputs as yellow.
- ""walm"" is once again followed by a green, resuming the sequence.
- Immediately after ""walm,"" we see the next color in sequence, blue, despite there being a ""zup,"" which was yellow earlier.

The conclusion is that ""walm"" resets the color sequence to green if a green hasn't appeared immediately before it, and following ""walm"" the sequence continues from where ""green"" left off.

3. **zup dax lug walm zup**
   Output: yellow green blue **blue** yellow
   
4. **zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf**
   Output: yellow blue yellow **yellow** green red red
   
5. **lug zup walm lug**
   Output: blue yellow **yellow** yellow blue

In each sequence, it appears that ""walm"" does not always correspond to the same color, suggesting that its meaning is context-dependent. Analyzing the patterns:

- In the 1st and 2nd examples, ""dax"" appears before ""walm"" but the outputs are different: green before ""walm"" leads to a red output once and a green output the next time. Therefore, ""walm"" is not dependent solely on the word ""dax.""
- In the 3rd and 4th examples, ""zup"" is present both before and after ""walm"" in the sequences. For both, the output color for ""walm"" is the same as the color that precedes it, suggesting a possible pattern of duplication.
- In the 5th example, ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" and before ""lug."" The output for ""walm"" is the same color as ""zup,"" which is yellow, again indicating duplication.

From these observations, we can hypothesize that ""walm"" has a replicative function—it causes the output to repeat the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: walm -> causes the next output to repeat the color of the preceding word.",0.8,171,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's examine it in the context of other words from the given examples, looking for patterns in the output. We will look at the text before and after ""walm"" and how they relate to the corresponding output colors.

From the examples, here is what we see:

1. ""dax walm wif"" translates to ""green green green red.""
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""wif"" to red, and ""walm"" is preceded by ""green.""

2. ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" translates to ""green green green red blue green green green.""
   Repeating ""dax walm"" yields repeating ""green green,"" suggesting ""walm"" directly translates to green when it follows ""dax.""

3. ""zup dax lug walm zup"" translates to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow.""
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and still translates to ""blue.""

4. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red.""
   ""walm"" is followed by ""yellow,"" and since ""dax"" translates to green, this suggests ""walm"" may again mean yellow, but we see ""zup"" can also mean yellow.

5. ""lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue.""
   Here, ""walm"" is preceded and followed by ""yellow.""

Taking a closer look, it's clear that ""walm"" is consistently followed by the same color it precedes, suggesting that the rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color of the word following it.

Rule: ""walm"" -> takes on the color of the next word in the sequence.",0.8,171,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can induce a rule for what the nonce word ""walm"" might mean in the context of these inputs and outputs. The rule stems from observing the position and surroundings of ""walm"" in the inputs and the corresponding color in the outputs.

Here are the observations:
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the output is ""green red.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"", the output is ""blue.""
- When ""walm"" precedes ""lug"", the output is also ""blue.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup"", the output is ""yellow.""

The word ""walm"" appears to change the output color of the word that follows or precedes it to a specific color.

Now, by looking at the sequence of words that precede or follow ""walm"" and the consistent color that appears in the output, we can deduce that ""walm"" likely causes the word that comes immediately after it to be translated to the color that should've been designated to ""walm"". 

This means that whatever the color output associated with ""walm"" directly (not seen in the output, as it is being transferred to the next word), it causes the following word to take on that color instead of what would be its regularly assigned color. In the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" should be associated with ""yellow"", but instead of displaying ""yellow"", the following word does.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:
Rule: ""walm"" transfers its own output color to the next word in the sequence.

Based on this rule induction:
walm -> transfers its color assignment (presumably, ""yellow"") to the following word.",0.8,171,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: In each example where 'lug' is mentioned, the output always includes the color blue. The position of 'lug' in each input corresponds to the position of 'blue' in the output, indicating that 'lug' translates to 'blue' regardless of context.",1.0,172,lug
"Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be:

dax -> green. Rule: The word 'dax' corresponds to the color 'green' in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence.,1.0,172,dax
"dax -> green. Rule: Whenever the word 'dax' is presented in the input, the corresponding output is 'green'.",1.0,172,dax
"Based on the provided examples:

- When ""dax"" appears first in the input sequence, the corresponding output sequence starts with ""green"".
- When ""dax"" appears immediately after ""wif"" in the input sequence, the word that follows ""dax"" in the output sequence is ""green"" (Examples 1 and 2).
- When ""dax"" appears after ""bluf"", ""green"" does not necessarily immediately follow in the output sequence (Looking at examples 2 and 3, it is not immediately clear what ""dax"" represents in this context).
- When ""dax"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""zup"", ""green"" appears immediately after ""red"" in the output sequence (Example 5).

These observations support that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" when it directly follows ""wif"". However, there is insufficient information to conclude what ""dax"" means in the context when it is preceded by other words.

In summary, one clear rule can be deduced from the examples:

Rule: When ""dax"" immediately follows ""wif"", it translates to ""green"". For other contexts, the rule cannot be determined with the given examples.

Thus, the most consistent interpretation with the available evidence is:
dax -> green (when following ""wif"")
For other instances, further examples would be necessary to properly ascertain the meaning of ""dax"".",1.0,172,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green."" Whenever the word ""dax"" is present in the input, the color ""green"" appears at the corresponding position in the output.

"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,172,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output.

"Rule: wif -> red

Based on the examples provided, whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, it consistently translates to ""red"" in the output.

"zup -> meaning. Meaning: yellow.

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,172,zup
"To determine what ""bluf"" means, we should look at the output that corresponds to each input where ""bluf"" is used. Here are the examples:

1. ""zup wif bluf"" correlates with ""yellow red red""
2. ""wif bluf dax"" correlates with ""red red green""
3. ""dax lug bluf wif"" correlates with ""green blue blue red""
4. ""wif bluf"" correlates with ""red red""
5. ""zup bluf"" correlates with ""yellow yellow""

We can see a pattern that wherever ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output color is repeated. For example, in ""wif bluf"" (input) and ""red red"" (output), the color red follows and is repeated. Another example is ""zup bluf"" (input) and ""yellow yellow"" (output), where the color yellow follows ""zup"" and is then repeated for ""bluf"".

Based on these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" means ""repeat the previous color"".

Rule: bluf -> repeat the previous color",1.0,172,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine its appearance in each input and the corresponding output.

1. ""zup wif bluf"" yields ""yellow red red"".
2. ""wif bluf dax"" yields ""red red green"".
3. ""dax lug bluf wif"" yields ""green blue blue red"".
4. ""wif bluf"" yields ""red red"".
5. ""zup bluf"" yields ""yellow yellow"".

Looking closely at the outputs, when ""bluf"" appears, it seems to result in a duplication of the color immediately preceding it.

In examples 1, 2, and 4, ""wif"" comes before ""bluf"" and the output is a double ""red"". In example 5, ""zup"" comes before ""bluf"" and the output is double ""yellow"". In example 3, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", which corresponds to ""blue"" in the output, again duplicated.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it.",1.0,172,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

Input: zup wif bluf | Output: yellow red red
Input: wif bluf dax | Output: red red green
Input: dax lug bluf wif | Output: green blue blue red
Input: wif bluf | Output: red red
Input: zup bluf | Output: yellow yellow

In each case, the word bluf corresponds to the color that comes directly before it. The rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color word immediately preceding it in the output.",1.0,172,bluf
"Analyzing the presented examples and their corresponding outputs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""bluf.""

Examples:

1. Input: zup wif bluf -> Output: yellow red red
2. Input: wif bluf dax -> Output: red red green
3. Input: dax lug bluf wif -> Output: green blue blue red
4. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
5. Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow

By examining the outputs, it seems that the appearance of ""bluf"" in the input yields a repeated color in the output. Specifically, ""bluf"" seems to result in the repetition of the color immediately preceding it:

1. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""bluf"" results in ""red red.""
2. Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""bluf"" yields ""red red.""
3. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""bluf"" gives us ""blue blue.""
4. Without another word following, ""wif bluf"" still gives us ""red red.""
5. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" causes the color word that precedes it to be repeated in the output. If the word is ""wif,"" we get ""red red""; if it's ""lug,"" we get ""blue blue""; and if it's ""zup,"" we get ""yellow yellow.""",0.8,172,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce a pattern for the word ""bluf"":

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output is always red red: 
   - wif bluf -> red red
   - wif bluf dax -> red red green

2. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"", it results in yellow yellow:
   - zup bluf -> yellow yellow

3. ""Bluf"" alone or at the end does not provide enough context, but we can infer the following rules from the first two observations:
   - ""wif"" seems to dictate the output ""red"".
   - ""zup"" dictates the output ""yellow"".
   - ""Bluf"", in these contexts, repeats the color indicated by the word preceding it.

So, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.",0.8,172,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's first look at the number of colors in the output corresponding to the input sentences:

1. Input: wif walm zup -> Output: red red red yellow
   - The sequence ""wif"" generates ""red red"" and the sequence ""zup"" generates ""yellow,"" implying ""walm"" generates a single ""red.""

2. Input: dax walm wif bluf -> Output: green green green red red
   - The sequence ""dax"" generates ""green green,"" the sequence ""wif"" generates ""red red,"" and ""bluf"" has not appeared in previous examples. Since ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and ""wif"" succeeds ""walm,"" and we have one extra ""green"" in the sequence, it may imply that ""walm"" by itself generates one ""green.""

3. Input: zup wif dax walm -> Output: yellow red green green green
   - From the previous examples, we know that ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green green."" At the end of the sequence, we have an extra ""green,"" which is consistent with the implication from the second example that ""walm"" may produce a single ""green.""

4. Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green
   - As ""dax"" generates ""green green"" and the output has an extra ""green,"" it further supports the idea that ""walm"" generates a single ""green.""

5. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf -> Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   - By analyzing the output, ""lug"" generates ""blue blue,"" and ""wif"" generates ""red."" The extra ""blue"" in the output could come from ""bluf,"" as it appears at the end, leaving ""walm"" as the single ""green,"" as it is followed by ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

Based on the given examples, ""walm"" seems to generate a color in the output regardless of its position or surrounding words, with each example suggesting that it corresponds to a single ""green.""

Rule: walm -> green.",1.0,172,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of ""green"" colors in the output. Specifically, it seems that ""walm"" results in three consecutive ""green"" colors. Every instance of ""walm"" in the input is directly followed by three ""green"" terms in the output regardless of its position. Other words (""wif"", ""dax"", ""zup"", ""lug"", ""bluf""), result in different colors, but ""walm"" consistently corresponds with three ""green"".

Therefore, the rule is:

walm -> three consecutive ""green"" colors in the output.",1.0,172,walm
"From the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" triggers a series of output colors that match the color associated with the word or words that immediately precede it. Specifically, ""walm"" seems to generate an output that repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Let's break down each example:

1. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and produces ""red red red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

2. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and produces ""green green green""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""bluf"" seems extraneous here, not aligning with a color in the output, but in the context of the fifth example it produces ""blue"".

3. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and produces ""green green green""

4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and produces ""green green green""

5. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and produces ""blue blue blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue""

Based on the pattern observed in these examples, the ""walm"" appears to cause a repeating effect of the color associated with the previous word and does so three times. Therefore:

Rule: walm -> means to repeat the color of the previous word three times.",1.0,172,walm
"Based on the examples provided, each instance of a word seems to be translated into a color. The examples suggest that each unique non-walm word corresponds to a specific color output. For instance:

- ""wif"" appears always followed by red.
- ""dax"" appears always followed by green.
- ""zup"" appears to correspond to yellow.
- ""bluf"" corresponds to red when following ""wif"" but to blue when at the end or not preceded by ""wif"".
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue.

The occurrences of ""walm"" correlate with repeated color outputs that match the previous non-walm word's associated color. The length of the repetition is one less than the number of words following ""walm"" including ""walm"" itself. In the last example (""lug walm wif lug bluf""), this does not hold for the word following ""walm"" which leads to the hypothesis that the rule is disrupted by a word that was used earlier in the sequence (i.e., ""lug"").

Based on the above observations, we can formulate the following rule for ""walm"":

walm -> Replicates the color associated with the preceding word, repeated for the number of consecutive words following ""walm"" including ""walm"" itself, minus one, unless the sequence is broken by a repetition of a previously used word.

Rule: ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the preceding word's color, with the number of repetitions equalling the number of words following ""walm"" (including ""walm"") minus one, this rule is reset if a word is repeated in the sequence.",0.8,172,walm
"From the provided examples, it seems that each occurrence of the word ""walm"" corresponds to three repetitions of the color that follows the word ""walm."" Here are the observations supporting this:

1. In ""wif walm zup,"" ""walm"" results in ""red red red"" followed by a ""yellow"" which corresponds to ""zup.""
2. In ""dax walm wif bluf,"" ""walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" then ""wif"" corresponds to a single ""red,"" and ""bluf"" results in two ""red"" indicating a repeat of the color corresponding to ""wif.""
3. In ""zup wif dax walm,"" ""walm"" is at the end, resulting again in ""green green green,"" which is the same color that ""dax"" corresponded to in the previous input.
4. When ""walm"" appears right after ""dax,"" the outcome is ""green green green,"" which is the same color coded for ""dax.""
5. In ""lug walm wif lug bluf,"" ""walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" which is a repetition of the color that ""lug"" corresponds to, followed by the colors for ""wif"" and ""lug"" again.

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we should look at the association between the inputs and outputs, seeking a pattern that applies consistently across all examples.

- In the first example, ""dax wif"" translates to ""green red."" Since ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red,"" we can propose that ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- The second example, ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf,"" becomes ""red green yellow red green green."" Again, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""dax"" appears to translate to ""green."" Additionally, ""zup"" seems to translate to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" at the end translates to ""green,"" though no ""bluf"" was present in the input to allow us to confirm this.
- In the third example, ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" maps to ""yellow yellow red green red yellow,"" which again supports ""dax"" as ""green,"" ""wif"" as ""red,"" and ""zup"" as ""yellow.""
- The fourth example is simply ""dax,"" and the output is ""green,"" which continues to support the rule that ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- The last example contains ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm,"" which maps to ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue."" This series maintains the consistency of ""dax"" as ""green.""

In all the examples provided, whenever the word ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" is:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,173,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

- When ""wif"" appears, the output always starts with ""red"".
- The presence of other words after ""wif"" results in additional colors in the output sequence.

Given that the color ""red"" consistently appears first in the output whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, irrespective of what follows, we can construct the following rule:

We also notice that 'wif' always corresponds to 'red', 'dax' always to 'green', 'lug' to 'blue', and 'walm' seems to multiply the output of the immediate previous color (except when following 'zup', as it then outputs multiple yellows).

- ""walm"" following any color (excluding ""zup"") repeats that color's output twice
- ""zup"" consistently results in a single ""yellow"" when at the beginning or middle of the sequence, and multiple ""yellow"" when followed by ""walm""

Therefore, the rule for 'zup' appears to be that it translates to ""yellow"". When 'zup' is followed by 'walm', the effect of 'walm' seems to be overridden, and rather than duplicating the color before it, 'walm' repeats ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow. When zup is followed by walm, output multiple yellows instead of duplicating the preceding color as walm normally causes.",1.0,173,zup
"Based on the given examples, it appears that each nonce word correlates to a specific color. The word ""zup"" seems to be associated with the color ""yellow."" In every output, the presence of the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" appearing in the sequence.

However, from the given examples, there's no clear pattern that the number of ""yellow"" depends on the number of ""walm"" instances because we don't have a case where ""zup"" is not directly followed by ""walm"" to compare against. We do notice that whenever ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" additional repetitions of ""yellow"" correspond to the repetitions of ""walm."" So the rule seems to imply that ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and it might influence any following ""walm"" instances to also become ""yellow,"" but we cannot be totally certain with the given examples.

However, when ""dax"" comes before ""bluf,"" and there is no ""lug"" or ""wif"" between them, ""bluf"" translates to ""green."" It seems that ""bluf"" takes on a color that is determined by its immediate preceding context. To define a rule clearly, we need to consider the possible scenarios:

1. When ""bluf"" directly follows ""lug,"" it is ""blue.""
2. When ""bluf"" directly follows ""wif,"" it is ""red.""
3. When ""bluf"" directly follows ""dax,"" with no ""lug"" or ""wif"" in between, it is ""green.""

The rule seems to be dependent on the word that immediately precedes ""bluf."" However, when ""bluf"" is output as ""green,"" it is specifically when ""dax"" is the preceding word, and not simply because there is no ""lug"" or ""wif"" between them. Without additional context or examples, we cannot definitively state what happens when ""bluf"" is preceded by other words like ""zup,"" or if ""bluf"" appears at the beginning.

Based on the examples and the deductions, the rule seems to be:
Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the word that directly precedes it: ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and ""dax"" leads to ""green"" (when there is no ""lug"" or ""wif"" between them).",0.9,173,bluf
bluf -> red,0.0,173,bluf
"bluf -> blue

Rule: Each word in the input is assigned a specific color in the output. ""Bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue.""",0.0,173,bluf
"bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red.",0.0,173,bluf
"Analyzing the examples provided, we can notice a pattern on how the word ""walm"" affects the output.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Input: dax walm zup lug
Output: green green green yellow blue

Looking at the patterns, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the color output associated with the word just before it, three times. For instance, in the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and when followed by ""walm,"" the output is three ""yellow"" words. In the second example, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and when ""walm"" follows it, there are three ""red"" words in the output.

Based on these observations, ""walm"" seems to act as a command that repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,173,walm
"From the context provided in the examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" is associated with the repeated output of the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"". To deduce the rule, let's look at the pattern:

- `zup walm` -> `yellow yellow yellow`
- `zup bluf wif walm` -> `yellow yellow red red red`
- `wif walm` -> `red red red`
- `dax lug walm` -> `green blue blue blue`
- `dax walm zup lug` -> `green green green yellow blue`

In each of these cases, ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times, except when ""walm"" follows two different words, in which case it takes the color of the word immediately before it and repeats it.

Given this pattern, we can induce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the name of the color associated with the word immediately before it to be repeated three times. If ""walm"" follows two different color words, it only takes the color associated with the word directly preceding it and repeats that color.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word three times. If preceded by two different color words, only repeat the color associated with the word directly before ""walm"".",0.9,173,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" produces a series of colors that correspond to the word that comes before it. The color repeats for a number of times that seems to also be determined by a rule based on the preceding word.

Here's the breakdown:

1. ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow"" - so ""walm"" after ""zup"" produces three yellows.
2. ""zup bluf wif walm"" produces ""yellow yellow red red red"" - so ""walm"" after ""wif"" produces three reds, ""bluf"" is ignored, it doesn't affect the output.
3. ""wif walm"" produces ""red red red"" - reinforcing that ""walm"" after ""wif"" produces three reds.
4. ""dax lug walm"" produces ""green blue blue blue"" - so ""walm"" after ""lug"" produces three blues, ""dax"" leads to one green being output before ""lug"" and the three blues.
5. ""dax walm zup lug"" produces ""green green green yellow blue"" - here ""walm"" after ""dax"" produces three greens, then ""zup"" and ""lug"" follow with their respective colors, yellow and blue.

Based on this pattern, we can deduce the following rule:

- ""walm"" takes the preceding word and transforms it into a color, which is then repeated a number of times dependent on that word's assigned color and quantity pattern.

So, the meaning of ""walm"" in these examples is a function that translates the previous word to its corresponding color(s), following these rules:
- ""zup"" before ""walm"" produces three yellows.
- ""wif"" before ""walm"" produces three reds.
- ""lug"" after any color but before ""walm"" produces three of the color blue.
- ""dax"" before ""walm"" produces three greens.

Therefore, the rule is:

walm -> meaning: A function that repeats the color output associated with the previous word, three times.",0.9,173,walm
"The examples provided suggest that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repeated output of the color word that is tied to the word immediately preceding it. Here's a breakdown of how ""walm"" works in each example:

1. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" might mean ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" indicates to repeat that color three times.

2. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" might mean ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" has no immediate effect (possibly a filler or no meaning), ""wif"" might mean ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats the most recent color, red, three times.

3. wif walm -> red red red
   - ""wif"" might mean ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats the color red three times.

4. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
   - ""dax"" might mean ""green,"" ""lug"" might mean ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats blue three times.

5. dax walm zup lug -> green green green yellow blue
   - ""dax"" might mean ""green,"" ""walm"" repeats green three times, ""zup"" is replacing the repeated color with ""yellow,"" and finally ""lug"" is ""blue"" (changing the output color once more without repetition).

Based on these examples, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the last mentioned color to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last mentioned color word three times.",0.9,173,walm
"Based on the examples given, the meaning of ""walm"" can be deduced by examining the number of repetitions and the associated colors.

In each instance, ""walm"" results in repetitions of a color that appears to be determined by the preceding word(s). Let's examine each example:

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Here, ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"", and we see three repetitions of ""yellow"".

2. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   In this case, ""wif"" is the last word before ""walm"", and we see three repetitions of ""red"".

3. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   With ""wif"" immediately preceding ""walm"", we see three repetitions of ""red"" again.

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   The word ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and we observe three repetitions of ""blue"".

5. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue
   The word ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and we note three repetitions of ""green"".

From these examples, it is apparent that the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the immediate preceding word to be repeated three times, and the output is the color associated with that word. However, this pattern breaks in the fifth example where ""zup"" does not follow this rule since it is after the ""walm"", suggesting that ""walm"" induces the triplication of the preceding color only when it is directly followed by a word.

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times, as long as it is the last word inputted before the output. If other words follow ""walm"", then the repetition pattern does not continue after ""walm"".",0.8,173,walm

"Based on the given examples, we can observe the following:

- In examples where ""wif dax"" or ""dax wif"" appear, the corresponding outputs are ""red green"" or ""green red,"" respectively. This suggests ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" likely corresponds to ""green.""
  
- In examples where ""lug dax"" or ""dax lug"" appear, the corresponding outputs are ""blue green"" or ""green blue,"" respectively. This suggests ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" again likely corresponds to ""green.""

- In the third example where only ""dax wif dax"" is given, the output is ""green red green,"" reinforcing that ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""wif"" is ""red.""

- Lastly, in the fifth example, ""wif bluf dax lug"" corresponds to ""red red green blue,"" where ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""dax"" appears to be ""green"" once more, consistent with previous deductions.

Therefore, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,174,dax
"To induce the rule for the nonce word ""dax,"" we'll analyze the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf

2. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green
   
3. Input: dax wif dax
   Output: green red green
   
4. Input: lug dax lug
   Output: blue green blue
   
5. Input: wif bluf dax lug
   Output: red red green blue

From these examples, we observe the following patterns in relation to ""dax"":

- Each time the word ""dax"" occurs, the word ""green"" is used in the output.
- The word ""dax"" is not dependent on its position in the sequence (beginning, middle, end), as ""green"" follows it in all cases.
- No other output color correlates with the word ""dax.""

Given these observations, we infer the following rule: 

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""",1.0,174,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""dax,"" we need to analyze the given examples and look for patterns. Let's start by examining where ""dax"" appears and what output it corresponds to.

1. wif dax zup wif dax bluf -> red green yellow red green green
   - ""dax"" appears twice and both times it is followed by the word ""green"" in the output.

2. wif lug dax walm -> red blue green green green
   - ""dax"" appears once and is followed by ""green green"" in the output, suggesting a pattern of repetition.

3. dax wif dax -> green red green
   - ""dax"" appears twice, both times followed by ""green"" in the output.

4. lug dax lug -> blue green blue
   - ""dax"" appears once and is followed by ""green"" in the output.

5. wif bluf dax lug -> red red green blue
   - ""dax"" appears once and is followed by ""green"" in the output.

From all examples, we can see that whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output. Additionally, we do not see any examples where ""dax"" would translate to any color other than green, despite the various different contexts it is used in. Hence, it seems that ""dax"" translates directly to the word ""green.""

3. ""wif"" appears to consistently correspond to the color ""red.""

"Observing the examples provided, we can see that when the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, it results in a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word directly preceding it.

Here are the observed correlations between the initial inputs and their corresponding outputs:

- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""blue blue.""
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""red red.""

Here are the examples illustrating this:

- ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"" because 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', and 'bluf' causes it to repeat.
- ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue red green green red"" because 'dax' corresponds to 'green', and 'bluf' makes 'green' repeat before 'wif', which corresponds to 'red'.
- ""lug wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue blue"" because 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', and 'bluf' causes 'blue' to repeat.
- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"" because 'wif' corresponds to 'red', and 'bluf' causes it to repeat.
- ""dax bluf lug wif"" translates to ""green green blue red"" because 'dax' corresponds to 'green', and 'bluf' results in 'green' repeating itself before moving on to 'lug' and 'wif', which correspond to 'blue' and 'red'.

- wif -> red
- dax -> green

Each time the word ""bluf"" appears, it is followed (or preceded, when it's the last word) by a color that matches the color associated with the previous input word. For example:

- In ""zup bluf,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and then ""bluf"" also corresponds to yellow.
- In ""lug wif lug bluf,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and then ""bluf"" also corresponds to blue.

"Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

Examining the examples:

1. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" which implies that ""walm"" refers to repeating the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow) three times.

2. ""dax zup dax walm"" results in ""green yellow green green green,"" which shows that the color associated with the word right before ""walm,"" which is ""dax,"" should be repeated three times (green).

3. ""lug walm"" yields ""blue blue blue,"" indicating the repetition of the color associated with ""lug"" (blue) three times.

4. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" gives ""yellow red green green green blue,"" where ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" following the pattern of repeating the color of the word immediately before ""walm"" three times.

- ""lug"" preceding ""walm"" generates ""blue""
- ""dax"" preceding ""walm"" generates ""green""

The number of times the color word is repeated in the output appears to be three, regardless of what the color is, with one exception: when ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it generates the color ""red"" repeated times based on the preceding sequences of ""walm.""

To summarize the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the word that comes right before it three times, except when it is preceded by ""wif,"" which appears to modify or trigger a different behavior where ""walm"" takes into account the number of preceding sequences of ""walm"" for its repetition of ""red.""

"zup -> yellow. 

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""",1.0,175,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze the examples and their outputs:

1. Input: zup
   Output: yellow
   
   In this case, ""zup"" maps directly to ""yellow.""

2. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   
   ""zup"" appears to map to ""yellow"" while ""walm"" and ""lug"" do not change the output color immediately. ""wif"" maps to blue which then turns red, and ""bluf"" also maps to red.

3. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   
   ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" turns ""yellow"" into ""red,"" and ""walm lug"" seems to not change the color, but the final word ""lug"" flips it to blue.

4. Input: wif zup dax
   Output: red yellow green
   
   ""wif"" maps to red, ""zup"" again to yellow, and ""dax"" maps to green.

5. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red
   
   ""zup"" to yellow and ""wif"" to red.

Based on the five examples, the rule appears to be:

- ""zup"" -> yellow

Thus, the meaning of ""zup"" consistently maps to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence. ""wif"" and ""dax"" are other nonce words that map to specific colors, but the procedure for them is not the question here. The rule, based solely on the given inputs and outputs, seems straightforward:

Rule: ""zup"" always maps to ""yellow.""",1.0,175,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be taking on the color value of the word that immediately precedes it. In every given input, the output for ""bluf"" is a repeat of the color represented by the word directly before it:

- In the first and third examples, ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red"". So here, ""bluf"" means ""red"" because it follows ""wif"", which represents the color red.
- In the second example, ""lug bluf"" leads to ""blue blue"" and ""zup bluf lug"" leads to ""yellow yellow blue"". Thus, ""bluf"" represents ""blue"" after ""lug"" and ""yellow"" after ""zup"".
- In the fourth example, ""lug bluf"" and ""dax bluf"" each time result in a repetition of the color represented by the words ""lug"" (blue) and ""dax"" (green).
- Similarly, in the fifth example, ""dax bluf"" again results in ""green green"", indicating that ""bluf"" takes on the color green following ""dax"".

Rule: bluf -> the color of the word that comes immediately before bluf.",1.0,175,bluf
"From the given examples, we can derive that the word 'bluf' repeats the color word that precedes it. Here are the given examples with explanations:

1. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   Here 'wif' means red, and 'bluf' repeats that color, resulting in 'red red.'

2. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
   'zup' means yellow, 'lug' means blue, and when 'bluf' appears after 'zup,' it repeats the yellow.

3. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   This is the same as the first example.

4. Input: lug bluf dax bluf
   Output: blue blue green green
   'lug' means blue, 'dax' means green, 'bluf' repeats the color before it, blue first and then green.

5. Input: wif zup dax bluf
   Output: red yellow green green
   Here 'dax' means green and 'bluf' follows 'dax', so it repeats green.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the preceding color word.",1.0,175,bluf
"To figure out the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we can analyze the relationship between the Input and Output in each example. The goal is to find a pattern that can explain every occurrence of the word ""bluf"" consistently across all examples.

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

Input: lug bluf dax bluf
Output: blue blue green green

Input: wif zup dax bluf
Output: red yellow green green

Looking at the examples:

1. ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" meaning bluf must translate to red when preceded by ""wif.""
2. ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" translates to yellow when it follows ""zup.""
3. ""lug bluf dax bluf"" translates to ""blue blue green green,"" telling us that ""bluf"" should translate to blue following ""lug"" and to green when followed by ""dax.""
4. ""wif zup dax bluf"" translates to ""red yellow green green,"" which again supports that ""bluf"" translates to green following ""dax.""

By examining these correlations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it. When it is preceded by ""wif,"" it is red, followed by ""lug,"" it is blue, and when ""dax"" follows it, ""bluf"" is green. The exception is when ""zup"" precedes it; ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color that precedes ""zup"" instead of becoming the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow).

Based on these observations, here is the deduced rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> meaning. ""Bluf"" takes on the color of the word that directly precedes it; however, when preceded by ""zup,"" ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that comes before ""zup."" In the absence of additional context (like ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" where ""bluf"" doesn't directly follow ""zup""), it's assumed that ""bluf"" would take on the color associated with the word immediate before. If multiple ""blufs"" occur in sequence, they repeat the color transformation from their immediate preceding context.",0.9,175,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the output ""red"" when preceded by “wif,” to ""yellow"" when preceded by “zup,” and to ""green"" when preceded by “dax.” Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word. If preceded by ""wif,"" output is ""red""; if preceded by ""zup,"" output is ""yellow""; if preceded by ""dax,"" output is ""green"".",0.8,175,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs, focusing on the occurrence of ""bluf"" and the color that is outputted in its place.

1. wif bluf -> red red
2. zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue
3. wif bluf -> red red
4. lug bluf dax bluf -> blue blue green green
5. wif zup dax bluf -> red yellow green green

From example 1 and 3, we see that ""wif bluf"" consistently results in ""red red,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" when following ""wif.""

In example 2, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup lug zup."" However, ""lug bluf"" in the same example results in ""blue blue"" where ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" following ""lug.""

Example 4 shows ""lug bluf dax bluf"" turning into ""blue blue green green."" Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" when following ""lug,"" and ""green"" following ""dax.""

Lastly, example 5 has ""wif zup dax bluf,"" which translates to ""red yellow green green."" In this example, just like in example 4, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" following ""dax.""

Based on these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it. Specifically:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it takes on the color ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" it takes on the color ""blue.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it takes on the color ""green.""
- There is no example of ""bluf"" following ""zup"" without another color word in between, so we do not have a direct correspondence in that case.

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word directly preceding it. If the preceding word denotes a color, then ""bluf"" is that color. If there is no direct color word before ""bluf,"" the rule is not clear based on the given examples.",0.8,175,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look at the pattern of colors in the output relative to the presence of the word ""walm"" in the input. Here are the observations:

1. When ""lug walm"" appears, the output is ""blue blue blue.""
   - It seems that ""lug"" translates to a single ""blue.""

2. When ""dax walm"" appears, the output is ""green green green.""
   - It seems that ""dax"" translates to a single ""green.""

3. When ""wif walm"" appears, the output is ""red red red.""
   - It seems that ""wif"" translates to a single ""red.""

In all instances of ""walm,"" it is followed by a color that is represented three times. 

Given these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" triples the color that is represented by the word preceding it.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"":
walm -> repetition of the preceding color word three times.",1.0,175,walm
"Based on the provided inputs and outputs, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times. It does not seem to introduce a new color itself, but rather dictates the repetition behavior of the prior color. Here is the observed pattern:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green""
- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red""
- It doesn't matter what comes after ""walm""; it influences the word before it.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: walm causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times. 
walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word three times.",1.0,175,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the provided input and output examples. The word ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of colored words in the output. Each instance of ""walm"" seems to correspond to a specific color that is repeated three times. Let's analyze the instances:

1. lug walm -> blue blue blue
2. dax walm -> green green green
3. wif walm -> red red red

Also, note that the word immediately preceding ""walm"" is the one that determines the color:

- ""lug"" leads to ""blue blue blue""
- ""dax"" leads to ""green green green""
- ""wif"" leads to ""red red red""

Based on these observations, it appears that the meaning of ""walm"" is a signal to repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",1.0,175,walm
"Rule:

- walm -> repeats the color associated with the previous nonce word three times.

The color associations seem to be the following:

- lug -> blue 
- zup -> yellow 
- dax -> green 
- wif -> red

Thus, when 'walm' follows these nonce words, the color associated with the previous nonce word is repeated three times. 

walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous nonce word three times.",1.0,175,walm
"Analyzing the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" correlates with a pattern of repeating colors. The color associated with ""walm"" is dependent on the word that precedes it.

In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and ""zup"" resulting in three blue and then three yellow. While in the second example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" resulting in three green. In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" resulting in three red, and it follows ""lug"" after more words are present, resulting in a blue pattern once again. In the fourth example, ""lug"" is followed directly by ""walm,"" which leads to the sequence of one blue and three red. The final example has ""walm"" follow ""dax,"" leading to three green.

From these examples, we can induce that ""walm"" causes the output of three of the same color. The specific color is determined by the word that comes immediately before ""walm,"" according to a word-to-color mapping:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow

However, there are exceptions to the consistency of the output sequence as seen in example four where ""lug"" is followed directly by ""walm"" resulting in a sequence that involves both blue and red. Therefore, while it's clear that ""walm"" likely means a repetition of a color three times, the introduction of ""lug wif walm"" leading to a blue followed by red indicates a possibly modified rule when ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" even if ""lug"" is also present.

Given these observations, the meaning of ""walm"" seems to be that it signals the repetition of a certain color three times. The specific color is based on the word before ""walm,"" but additional context or ordering of words may modify the resulting sequence.

2. Whenever ""dax"" is preceded or followed by other nonce words, it corresponds to the color ""green.""
3. The position of ""dax"" in the sequence does not affect its output—it is always ""green.""

Considering this pattern, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: dax -> green. ""Dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in a sequence.",1.0,176,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" I will consider the repeated patterns and changes that occur in the examples provided:

1. Every time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the output is consistently ""red."" This suggests that ""wif"" corresponds directly to ""red.""

2. In the inputs where words other than ""wif"" are present, those words (""walm,"" ""zup,"" ""dax"") seem to correspond to colors other than red, indicated by the terms ""yellow,"" ""green,"" and an increase in the number of ""yellow""s in the output. However, since the question only asks for the meaning of ""wif,"" we'll focus on that term.

Given this, we arrive at the rule:

wif -> red

"wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word 'wif' is encountered in the input, it is translated to the color 'red' in the output.",1.0,176,wif

- The word ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- The word ""zup"" seems to correspond to the color ""yellow."" However, it occurs once without a color output. This inconsistency might suggest that ""zup"" either changes the proceeding color output or has a conditional output rule.
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

It's not entirely clear why ""zup"" doesn't always correspond to a color and why ""walm"" is repeated three times while ""wif"" and ""dax"" are not. However, based on the information we have, the following rule can be deduced:

Rule: ""wif"" -> red",1.0,176,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" No other context is changing the output associated with ""wif."" Given this information, the rule can be defined as:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""",1.0,176,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

1. When 'wif' appears alone as an input, the output is 'red'. This is consistent across the given examples.

2. When 'wif' is followed by 'walm' and 'zup' (as seen in the second example), each occurrence of 'walm' and 'zup' is replaced with three 'yellow' and one 'green', respectively, with 'wif' still translating to 'red'.

3. When 'wif' is followed by 'dax' and then 'zup' and 'walm' (as seen in the third example), 'dax' translates to 'green', following the pattern where 'zup' led to 'green' in the second example. The 'walm' after 'zup' again results in three 'yellow'.

However, without further examples or context, we cannot robustly determine whether 'wif' always translates to 'red', regardless of context, or whether 'wif' is context-sensitive and might alter its meaning in different sequences. Nevertheless, we are going to assume 'wif' consistently means 'red', given the limited dataset.

Rule: 'wif' -> 'red'",1.0,176,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that:

Input: zup
Output: yellow

The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" when it is the only word in the input.

Each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Input: dax zup lug bluf

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,176,zup
"Based on the given input and output examples, we can try to deduce the rule by which the word ""bluf"" is being translated into a color.

In each example, the occurrence of ""bluf"" in the output is represented by the color word ""yellow."" Additionally, ""bluf"" seems to appear twice in the output regardless of its position in the input. Since no other words in the inputs are consistently translated into the word ""yellow,"" and the repetition pattern is unique to ""bluf,"" we can infer the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> ""yellow yellow""

Meaning, whenever the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the word ""yellow"" being outputted twice.",1.0,176,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following correlations:

- When ""lug"" is present in the input, the output includes ""blue"".
- When ""zup"" is present in the input, the output includes ""yellow"".
- When ""dax"" is present in the input, the output includes ""green"".

Now, let's consider ""bluf"":

- In every example where ""bluf"" is present, the output repeats the color associated with the preceding word.
- ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"".
- ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue"".
- When included with other words, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color of the word that comes just before it.

From this, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color associated with the previous word in the sequence.",1.0,176,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to determine the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"":

1. In every example, the word ""bluf"" is followed by an output of at least two colors.
2. The color that appears twice in the output is the same as the color associated with the word preceding ""bluf.""

Now, let's attempt to pair the preceding words with their color outputs to find a pattern:

- ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output is ""yellow yellow,"" so ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output is ""blue blue,"" so ""lug"" corresponds to blue.

In both examples, the color output is the same and it's doubled. This suggests that the rule for ""bluf"" involves duplicating the color associated with the preceding word.

Therefore, we can define the rule for ""bluf"" as follows:

bluf -> meaning. When ""bluf"" follows another word, the output is that word's corresponding color, repeated twice.

Rule: The word ""bluf"" causes the duplication of the color associated with the word that precedes it.",0.8,176,bluf
"Based on the examples given, it appears that each unique word corresponds to a specific color. Here's the color assignment for each word based on the inputs and outputs provided:

- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green

When ""bluf"" appears in an input, the output always contains the same color repeated. Here is what we observe:

- ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" meaning bluf when used with zup results in the same color as zup.
- ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue,"" so bluf with lug also results in the same color as lug.
- ""wif bluf"" would presumably result in ""red red,"" following the same rule (though it's not explicitly shown in an example).
- ""dax bluf"" results in ""green red red,"" which is slightly different since green is only mentioned once, followed by ""red red,"" which corresponds to bluf wif.

From these examples, it seems that bluf duplicates the color of the word that came right before it, except in the case where ""dax"" comes before ""bluf"" - in which case ""dax"" does not get duplicated. This difference might be due to a mistake in the input/output pairs, or ""dax"" might have a unique rule when used with bluf that isn't explained by the examples given. Assuming it was a mistake and adhering to the pattern with other words:

Rule: bluf corresponds to the color of the word that immediately precedes it. If there's no preceding word, it seems that there's no color (as no such example is given).

Therefore:

Rule: bluf -> yellow,0.0,176,bluf
"Rule: walm seems to signify a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it.

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""wif zup walm dax zup,"" walm is followed by three ""yellow"" which is the color corresponding to ""zup.""
- In the second example, ""wif lug walm,"" walm is followed by three ""blue"" which corresponds to ""lug.""
- In the third example, ""dax wif walm,"" walm is followed by three ""red"" which corresponds to ""wif.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax walm,"" walm is followed by three times the color ""green,"" which corresponds to ""dax.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif lug dax walm,"" walm repeats the color ""green"" which corresponds to ""dax,"" the word immediately before walm.

Based on the examples, we infer that ""walm"" indicates repetition of the last color mentioned.

walm -> Repeats the color of the word immediately before it three times.",1.0,176,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", we can look at the output patterns associated with its presence in different inputs:

Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
- ""wif"" outputs red, ""zup"" outputs yellow, ""dax"" outputs green. After ""walm"", the colors repeat yellow until another word appears, which then outputs green.

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue
- ""wif"" outputs red, ""lug"" outputs blue. After ""walm"", the color blue repeats.

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red
- ""dax"" outputs green, ""wif"" outputs red. After ""walm"", the color red repeats.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- ""dax"" outputs green. After ""walm"", the color green repeats.

Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green
- ""wif"" outputs red, ""lug"" outputs blue, ""dax"" outputs green. After ""walm,"" the color green repeats.

From these inputs and outputs, it seems ""walm"" makes the color of the word immediately preceding it repeat until a new word appears that has a different designated color.

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the previous word's output to repeat until a new word with a different associated color appears.",1.0,176,walm
"In each example, the output following the word ""walm"" is a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm."" Here's the breakdown of associations between the nonce words and color outputs:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Based on these examples, the rule for the word ""walm"" appears to indicate repetition of the previous word's associated color for the remainder of the output. Using this rule, we can define ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word for the remainder of the output.",1.0,176,walm
"Based on the provided examples, where walm is included in various sequences and results in repeated color outputs, we can infer the following:

1. The first word in the input determines the first color in the output. For example, ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""dax"" corresponds to green.

2. Each word following the first modifies the subsequent color in the sequence, with walm signifying a repetition of the color immediately prior to its occurrence, for as many times as the sequence continues.

3. The number of times the color is repeated after walm is not fixed but is equivalent to the number of remaining positions in the output sequence after it appears.

Thus, the rule can be stated as:
Rule: walm indicates a repetition of the color immediately preceding it, continuing for the remaining length of the sequence.

Applying this rule:
- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which corresponds to yellow, so the output is consecutive yellows continuing after the walm.
- In the second example, ""walm"" repeats the blue from ""lug"".
- In the third and fourth examples, it repeats the red from ""wif"" and the green from ""dax"", respectively.
- In the last example, ""walm"" repeats the green from ""dax"".

Therefore, the definition can be summarized as:
walm -> repetition of the preceding color for the rest of the sequence.",1.0,176,walm
"Given the examples, it seems that the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" is related to a color repetition rule. Looking closely at the patterns, we can deduce the following:

1. The color that ""walm"" produces in the output is directly influenced by the word that comes immediately before it. 
2. The color ""walm"" produces is repeated for a number of times that matches the total number of words in the input. 
3. Every instance of ""walm"" is followed by repeated colors in the output.

Now, let’s break down each example to find out the specific rule:

Input: wif zup walm dax zup - Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow.
- ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" which corresponds to the color yellow.
- There are five words in the input, so ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" being repeated four times (excluding the instance of ""zup"" immediately preceding ""walm"").

Input: wif lug walm - Output: red blue blue blue.
- ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" which corresponds to blue.
- There are three words in the input, so ""walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated three times.

Input: dax wif walm - Output: green red red red.
- ""walm"" comes after ""wif"" which corresponds to red.
- There are three words in the input, so ""walm"" results in ""red"" being repeated three times.

Input: dax walm - Output: green green green.
- ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" which corresponds to green.
- There are two words in the input, so ""walm"" leads to ""green"" being repeated twice.

Input: wif lug dax walm - Output: red blue green green green.
- ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" which corresponds to green.
- There are four words in the input, so ""walm"" results in ""green"" being repeated four times (but there's one green already for ""dax"", so only three additional greens show up in the output).

Based on the pattern in the examples, we can define the rule for ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: The output of ""walm"" is the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it, repeated as many times as there are total words in the input sentence, excluding any repetitions due to the presence of ""walm"".

Therefore, walm -> meaning: A rule that takes the color associated with the preceding word and repeats it according to the total count of words present in the input.",0.9,176,walm
"lug -> blue. 

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,177,lug

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example.",1.0,177,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each instance of ""dax"" in the input is translated to ""green"" in the output. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,177,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the context of other words present. Each instance of ""dax"" in the input results in the word ""green"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,177,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the output. This can be determined by the direct correspondence between each instance of ""dax"" and the word ""green"" in the translated outputs, regardless of the other words present in the input.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,177,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green."" Every instance of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

Thus, the rule is:

"Rule: dax -> green

This rule is deduced based on the consistent output whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, it always corresponds to the color green.",1.0,177,dax
"Based on the examples provided, each instance of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output. It seems that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Additionally, other words like ""zup,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug"" correspond to their own color outputs, such as ""yellow,"" ""green,"" and ""blue,"" respectively.

The rule appears to be a direct mapping from specific nonce words to colors:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,177,wif

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,177,wif
"Based on the examples given, wif always corresponds to the word ""red"" in the Output.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as: wif -> red.",1.0,177,wif
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" is consistently translated to the color ""red."" Regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input sequence or the words that surround it, the output consistently includes ""red"" for ""wif."" Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,177,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output. This is consistent across all given examples, regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input sequence or the presence of other words.",1.0,177,wif
"To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""zup,"" let's try to establish a relationship between the inputs and outputs. We will compare the positions of ""zup"" in the input to the colors in the output.

1. dax wif walm lug zup -> green red red red blue yellow
2. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
3. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
4. lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow
5. zup dax wif -> yellow green red

Let's check each position where ""zup"" appears and the corresponding color:

- When ""zup"" is at the end of the sequence (Example 1 and 4), the corresponding color is yellow.
- When ""zup"" is at the beginning of the sequence (Examples 2, 3, and 5), the corresponding color is also yellow.

In every example given, regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence, the output color is always yellow. Therefore, we can induce that the rule for ""zup"" is that it always corresponds to the color yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,177,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow."" Each input example that contains ""zup"" results in an output where ""yellow"" is included only once, just like the occurrence of ""zup."" Here's the pattern that supports this deduction:

- Whenever ""zup"" is mentioned, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output.
- The position of ""yellow"" in the output corresponds to the position of ""zup"" in the input.

It's crucial to note that while the meaning of the other nonce words (e.g., dax, wif, walm, lug, bluf) might vary, the word ""zup"" consistently maps to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position.

Therefore, the rule is:
zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,177,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the word ""zup"" by comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs. Let's organize the information we have:

1. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow
   
2. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   
3. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   
4. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
   
5. Input: zup dax wif
   Output: yellow green red

From the examples, we can see that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. Moreover, it seems that ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output. To confirm that, analyze each line where ""zup"" is included:

1. ""zup"" is at the end, and ""yellow"" is at the end.
2. ""zup"" is at the beginning, and ""yellow"" is at the beginning.
3. ""zup"" is at the beginning, and ""yellow"" is at the beginning.
4. ""zup"" is at the end, and ""yellow"" is at the end.
5. ""zup"" is at the beginning, and ""yellow"" is at the beginning.

In each instance where ""zup"" appears in the input, a ""yellow"" appears at the corresponding position in the output. Therefore, the rule can be concluded as:

zup -> yellow",1.0,177,zup
"Analyzing the given examples, we observe the following:

- Each instance of ""zup"" correlates to an output of ""yellow.""
- Each word in the input maps to a specific color in the output, with ""zup"" consistently mapping to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

From these observations, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,177,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

From the examples given, every time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the color ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. This direct one-to-one correspondence suggests that the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""",1.0,177,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Regardless of the position or the other words (dax, lug, wif, zup) surrounding ""bluf"" in the input, the output always includes the color red in the position matching ""bluf."" Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> red",1.0,177,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" repeats the color that is translated from the word immediately preceding it. Here is the pattern observed:

1. ""dax lug bluf"" translates to ""green blue blue"" - ""bluf"" repeats the color resulting from ""lug"" which is blue.
2. ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax"" - ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and translates to red, the same as ""wif.""
3. ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"" - ""bluf"" repeats the color resulting from ""lug"" which is blue.
4. ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red"" - ""bluf"" repeats the color resulting from ""wif"" which is red.
5. ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red green red red"" - ""bluf"" repeats the color resulting from ""wif"" which is red.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the word before it.",1.0,177,bluf
"By examining the outputs associated with the sequences that include ""bluf,"" we can look for patterns that might suggest what ""bluf"" means. Let's look at each input/output pair:

1. Input: dax lug bluf | Output: green blue blue
2. Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax | Output: red red yellow red blue green
3. Input: lug bluf | Output: blue blue
4. Input: dax wif bluf | Output: green red red
5. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf | Output: yellow red green red red

The presence of ""bluf"" always results in a sequence where the color ""red"" is present in the output. 

From the first, third, and fourth examples, we can see that:
- When ""bluf"" immediately follows ""lug"" or ""dax,"" which both map to ""blue"" and ""green"" respectively, the output is ""blue"" and ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" immediately follows ""wif,"" which maps to ""red,"" the output is ""red.""

This suggests a rule that ""bluf"" transforms the previous color into ""red."" However, in the second example, ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red,"" not ""red yellow,"" so it does not directly transform the previous color into red but rather repeats it.

The exact rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it repeats the color denoted by the previous word in the output. Example 2 is key here since ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" which outputs ""red,"" and ""bluf"" results in another ""red.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:
bluf -> Repeat the color of the previous word in the output. 

Rule: If the previous word turns into the color ""X"" in the output, then ""bluf"" also turns into the color ""X.""",0.8,177,bluf
"Analyzing the inputs and outputs given, it appears that each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output. Here's the correlation observed from the given examples:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow

Each time the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""red"". The word ""bluf"" appears after different words in each example and is consistently translated to ""red"" regardless of the position or the words that come before or after it. 

Therefore, the rule for the word ""bluf"" is as follows:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: bluf -> red
",0.0,177,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red

The rule deduced from the above examples shows that every time the nonce word ""bluf"" is used, the output is ""red,"" regardless of the surrounding words.",0.0,177,bluf
"To figure out the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the pattern in each input and its corresponding output.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
In this case, ""dax"" leads to a single ""green"" and ""walm"" seems to repeat it twice more.

Input: zup lug walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue
Here, ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" seems to repeat ""blue"" twice more.

Input: dax lug wif walm
Output: green blue red red red
In this example, ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""walm"" seems to repeat ""red"" twice more.

Input: lug walm wif lug
Output: blue blue blue red blue
Observing this, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""walm"" duplicates ""blue"" two more times, ""wif"" is ""red,"" and the final ""lug"" is ""blue,"" sticking to the established pattern.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
Again, ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats it two more times.

Based on these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" takes the color associated with the word immediately before it and repeats that color two more times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word two more times.",1.0,177,walm
"Considering the given examples where the input includes the word ""walm"" and a corresponding output of repeated colors, it seems that the word ""walm"" in the context given denotes a repetition of the color linked to the preceding nonce word. In each case, ""walm"" seems to trigger the repetition of the color that immediately precedes it. Here's the breakdown:

- ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green,"" so ""walm"" causes the color for ""dax"" (green) to repeat three times.
- ""zup lug walm"" outputs ""yellow blue blue blue"", where ""walm"" makes the color for ""lug"" (blue) repeat three times.
- ""dax lug wif walm"" outputs ""green blue red red red,"" where ""walm"" makes the color for ""wif"" (red) repeat three times.
- ""lug walm wif lug"" outputs ""blue blue blue red blue,"" where ""walm"" makes the color for ""lug"" (blue) repeat three times, and then the sequence continues with the colors for ""wif"" (red) and ""lug"" (blue).

Given these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to repeat three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the preceding word to repeat three times.",1.0,177,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we will examine the outputs that accompany its presence in the input, considering the surrounding context provided by other words.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Input: zup lug walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue

Input: dax lug wif walm
Output: green blue red red red

Input: lug walm wif lug
Output: blue blue blue red blue

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Based on the given examples, whenever the word ""walm"" is present, the output consists of a sequence of colors that repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" It appears that the number of repetitions of the color word in the output matches the number of total words in the input preceding the word ""walm."" For example, ""dax walm"" consists of two words before ""walm,"" and the output is ""green green green,"" indicating that ""dax"" equals ""green"" and the repetition occurs three times. We can also see that ""zup"" equals ""yellow,"" ""lug"" equals ""blue,"" and ""wif"" equals ""red.""

Given this pattern, here is the rule we can deduce:

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in the input, the output is a sequence of the color associated with the word immediately prior to ""walm,"" repeated a number of times that is one more than the total number of words preceding ""walm"" in the input sequence.

Thus:

walm -> meaning. The output when ""walm"" is in the input is a sequence of the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm,"" repeated (number of words before ""walm"" in the input + 1) times.",0.8,177,walm
"From the examples given, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" has a rule associated with its occurrence in the input. Examining each input and corresponding output pair, we can try to deduce this rule.

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

2. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue

3. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red

4. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue

5. Input: dax walm (repeated example)
   Output: green green green

Looking to find a pattern, we notice:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green.""
- When ""zup lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output sequence starts with ""yellow blue,"" followed by two additional ""blue.""
- When ""dax lug wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the outputs are ""green blue red,"" followed by two additional ""red.""
- In the case where ""lug"" surrounds ""walm"" with ""wif"" following, the outputs are ""blue,"" then repetition of ""blue"" for ""walm,"" followed by ""red blue.""

From these observations, the rule can be deduced as follows:

- ""walm"" prompts the repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it, and the number of repetitions seems to be three.

Hence, we can establish:

walm -> meaning. Rule: Whenever ""walm"" appears in an input, it causes the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word to be output three times.",0.8,177,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we must analyze the patterns in the inputs and the corresponding outputs.

The first and fifth examples are identical, and the output is the same, which provides a check for consistency.

1. Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green
2. Input: zup lug walm -> Output: yellow blue blue blue
3. Input: dax lug wif walm -> Output: green blue red red red
4. Input: lug walm wif lug -> Output: blue blue blue red blue

By comparing the inputs and outputs, we can try to deduce the rule for ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"", indicating that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color corresponding to the word just before it, which in this case is ""green"" (for ""dax"").
- The second example, ""zup lug walm,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" results in ""yellow blue blue blue"". Here again, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color corresponding to the word before it (which is ""blue"") three times.
- In the third example, ""dax lug wif walm,"" the ""walm"" yields ""red red red"" at the end of the sequence, indicating that it repeats the color before it (which is ""red"" for ""wif"") three times.
- The fourth example, ""lug walm wif lug,"" where ""lug"" is before ""walm,"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" showing the repetition pattern holds.

Given the consistency across all examples, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately before it to repeat three times.

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green."" This can be seen as it is always mapped to ""green"" in the output regardless of its position in the input string or the other words surrounding it.

2. Input: wif dax lug

   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

4. Input: lug dax lug wif

5. Input: zup wif

From the above examples, we can see a pattern:
- Whenever ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red.""
- The word ""zup"" is consistently translated to ""yellow.""
- The word ""lug"" is consistently translated to ""blue.""
- The word ""dax"" is translated to ""green.""


Based on this pattern, it seems that ""wif"" always corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input string. Therefore, we can deduce that:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,178,wif
"Based on the given examples, wif correlates to the color red. Every instance where the input contains the word ""wif,"" the output includes the color red.

"Based on the examples provided, wif seems to correspond to the color 'red.' However, in the third example, wif is followed by 'dax,' which causes the output to be 'red green' instead of just 'red.'

Nonetheless, in every other instance where 'wif' appears by itself and is not directly followed by another word that could influence its output, it corresponds to 'red.' 

Hence, the general rule seems to indicate that 'wif' corresponds to 'red,' with an exception observed when it directly precedes 'dax,' where the output also includes 'green' after 'red.'

1. Input: ""lug walm zup lug walm""
   Output: ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue""
   
   Here, the word ""walm"" appears twice, after ""lug"" and before ""zup"" the first time, and after ""lug"" the second time. Since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and we see ""blue blue blue"" before ""yellow"" and ""blue blue blue"" again after ""yellow,"" it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of ""blue"" three times.

2. Input: ""lug walm""
   Output: ""blue blue blue""
   
   Again, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and we see three ""blue"" occurrences in the output, reinforcing the idea of a threefold repetition.

3. Input: ""wif lug dax walm""
   Output: ""red blue green green green""
   
   In this case, we see ""walm"" following ""dax,"" and the output has ""green"" repeated thrice. Since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" it seems ""walm"" takes on the color of the preceding word three times.

4. Input: ""wif walm dax zup""
   Output: ""red red red green yellow""
   
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and we see ""red"" repeated three times. This supports our hypothesis that ""walm"" may cause a repetition of the color indicated by the previous word.

5. Input: ""zup wif walm""
   Output: ""yellow red red red""
   
   Again, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output has ""red"" repeated three times.

Based on these examples, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times.

So our definition will be:
walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word three times.",1.0,178,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to contribute three instances of the color ""red"" to the output when preceded by ""wif,"" ""blue"" to the output when preceded by ""lug,"" and ""red"" to the output when preceded by ""zup"" or when ""walm"" follows ""zup."" When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" ""walm"" contributes three instances of ""green.""

To synthesize these observations into a general rule:

Rule: walm -> When preceded by 'wif' or followed by 'dax,' generates three instances of the color associated with the preceding or following word (""wif"" -> red, ""dax"" -> green). When preceded by 'lug,' 'walm' yields three instances of blue, and when preceded by or following 'zup,' it yields a single instance of red.",0.8,178,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to add three occurrences of a specific color to the sequence. However, the color that ""walm"" produces seems to depend on the word that immediately precedes it. Here are the observations:

1. When preceded by ""lug,"" ""walm"" adds three blues to the sequence.
2. When ""walm"" itself is preceded by nothing or starts the sequence, it defaults to adding three reds.
3. When preceded by ""wif,"" ""walm"" once again adds three reds.
4. When preceded by ""dax,"" ""walm"" adds three greens to the sequence.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be as follows:

- ""walm"" means to add three of a certain color to the sequence.
- The color added by ""walm"" is determined by the word immediately preceding it:
  - ""lug"" before ""walm"" results in blue.
  - ""dax"" before ""walm"" results in green.
  - ""walm"" by itself or any other context not explicitly defined results in red.

Rule: walm -> add three of a color, determined by the word before ""walm"": blue after ""lug,"" green after ""dax,"" and red otherwise.",0.8,178,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" generates a sequence of the color ""red"" repeated three times in the output.

Input: dax walm wif -> Output: green green green red

Input: wif -> Output: red

Observations:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears, the color ""red"" is in the output. 
- ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red"" regardless of its position.
- In every instance where ""wif"" is alone or the last word in the sequence, ""red"" is the last color in the output sequence.
- No matter how many other words are before ""wif,"" ""red"" is always produced in the output.
- ""wif"" does not seem to affect the presence of other colors, which suggests that other words like ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" etc., correspond to the other colors in the output.

2. ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green green green red"": Again, ""wif"" maps to ""red.""
3. ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue"": ""wif"" is at the start and maps to ""red,"" while ""lug"" maps to ""blue.""
4. ""wif"" -> ""red"": ""wif"" by itself still maps to ""red.""
5. ""zup bluf wif dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow red green blue"": The position of ""wif"" after ""zup"" and ""bluf"" and before ""dax"" and ""lug"" does not affect its output. It still maps to ""red.""

Rule:
wif -> ""red""",1.0,179,wif
"Based on the examples provided:

- ""dax"" corresponds with ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue""
- ""walm"" corresponds with ""green"" (repeatedly) because ""dax walm wif"" leads to ""green green green red""

It seems that each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output. However, when ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" is produced in the output at the position where ""wif"" occurs. When ""wif"" is by itself, it simply outputs ""red.""

So the rule would be:

"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" is included in the input, the resulting output includes the color ""red.""

The word ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the given examples.",0.0,179,bluf
"Based on the examples given, we can induce the following rules for each input element:

- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".

Given this pattern, it appears that ""walm"" produces a sequence of three colors that are the same as the color corresponding to the word preceding it. Here are the inductions:

- In the first example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"", indicating that ""walm"" repeats the ""green"" that corresponds to ""dax"" three times.
- Correspondingly, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"", where ""walm"" repeats the ""yellow"" that corresponds to ""zup"" three times.
- Whenever ""walm"" was used in sequence with other words like ""lug"" or ""wif,"" a different color was produced for those words but did not alter the repetition of three colors for ""walm"".

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, it outputs the color corresponding to that word three times consecutively.

Hence, the meaning can be described as:

walm -> A repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, repeated three times.",1.0,179,walm
"walm -> three times the color associated with the word before it.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word (like dax or zup), the color associated with that preceding word is repeated three times. For example:
- ""dax walm"" produces ""green green green"" because the color associated with ""dax"" is green.
- ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow"" because the color associated with ""zup"" is yellow.",1.0,179,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the given examples and their corresponding outputs.

- In every instance, ""walm"" is followed by a sequence of colors, starting with a specific color repeated three times then varying afterward.
- ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in ""green green green.""
- ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- When other words follow ""walm,"" the color sequence changes, but the initial three colors remain consistent with the word preceding ""walm.""

Based on these examples, it seems that ""walm"" represents an action or modifier that triggers a series of three colors corresponding to the word that comes before ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> the subsequent three colors repeat the color coded for the word that comes immediately before walm.",0.9,179,walm
"Analyzing the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" is associated with a repeated sequence of three colors. When ""walm"" is used preceded by a single word, it triggers a triplet of colors. Also, the specific color seems to be dependent on the word that comes before ""walm"". 

In the first and second examples, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"". In the third and fourth examples, ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"". Lastly, in the fifth example, ""lug walm"" turns into ""blue blue blue"".

It's noteworthy that when other words are present after ""walm"", such as ""wif dax"", they seem to generate additional colors following the sequence of triple colors induced by ""walm"". For example, ""lug zup wif dax"" yields ""blue yellow red green"", and these colors correspond to those words based on the supplied examples.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be summarized as follows:
walm -> Generates a repetition of three colors. The specific color is dependent on the word that directly precedes ""walm"".

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a single word, it generates three consecutive colors, with the color being determined by the preceding word. If followed by additional words, ""walm"" generates its sequence of three colors first, followed by the colors corresponding to the subsequent words.",0.9,179,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's consider the given examples and outputs.

Observing the outputs following ""walm,"" we can note that:
- After ""dax walm,"" the output is three greens. ""Dax"" is followed by red when it appears after ""wif.""
- After ""zup walm,"" the output is three yellows. ""Zup"" is followed by blue when it appears after ""lug"" and red when paired with ""wif dax.""
- The word ""lug"" results in blue output.

Now, let's focus on the occurrences of ""walm"":

1. Input: dax walm wif dax 
   Output: green green green red green
   - ""Walm"" follows the word ""dax,"" which is green, and the output is three greens in a row.

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - Similarly, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output is again three greens.

3. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   - Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which is yellow, leading to three yellows.

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - Following the pattern, ""zup"" results in yellow, and ""walm"" leads to three of the same color.

From these observations, we can propose the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word three times in the output.

walm -> Repetition of the preceding word's color three times.",0.8,179,walm

"Rule: The word ""bluf"" seems to change color based on the preceding word according to the following pattern:

- When preceded by ""wif,"" the word ""bluf"" yields the color green.
- When preceded by ""lug,"" the word ""bluf"" yields the color blue.
- When preceded by ""zup,"" the word ""bluf"" yields the color yellow.
- When preceded by ""dax,"" the word ""bluf"" yields the color green.

No other precedents for ""bluf"" are provided in the examples, so additional rules cannot be determined.

Based on the evidence from the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be that it takes the color output that was produced by the word directly preceding it in the sequence.

Therefore:

bluf -> the meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color indicated by the word that comes directly before it.",1.0,180,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to correlate with the output ""green."" When ""bluf"" is present in the input, ""green"" appears in the output sequence, following some particular patterns.

Here's a breakdown of the examples to support the deduction:

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm -> Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   - ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""lug,"" so it seems to trigger ""yellow"" and then ""blue,"" based on ""lug"" (lug -> blue).

2. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif -> Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   - When ""bluf"" is surrounded by other words, not including ""lug"" or ""zup,"" it corresponds to ""green.""

3. Input: wif dax bluf -> Output: red green green
   - ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the output is ""green"" after ""dax.""

4. Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green
   - Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and ""zup"" (yellow) in different instances, possibly being influenced by the preceding word to repeat the color.

5. Input: zup dax bluf -> Output: yellow green green
   - Once again, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is ""green"" after ""dax.""

The pattern seems complex as ""bluf"" may not have a consistent one-to-one correspondence with a specific color output. It appears that the term ""bluf"" acts as a modifier or an indicator, possibly of change or repetition based on its position and the surrounding words. One potential rule could be that ""bluf"" signals a repetition of previously mentioned colors or triggers the color ""green"" under specific conditions.

If we look at the data from the perspective of occurrence, ""bluf"" tends to trigger ""green"" when it follows ""wif"" or ""dax,"" but when it follows ""lug"" or ""zup,"" it triggers a repetition of the color associated with these words (""lug"" -> blue, ""zup"" -> yellow):

1. bluf after wif/dax -> green
2. bluf after lug -> blue (repeating the color for lug)
3. bluf after zup -> yellow (repeating the color for zup)

Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> When following ""wif"" or ""dax,"" the meaning is ""green."" When following ""lug"" or ""zup,"" it repeats the color associated with these words.",0.8,180,bluf
"bluf -> green

Rule: Whenever the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the output is ""green.""",0.0,180,bluf
"bluf -> green

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""green"" in the output.",0.0,180,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the output. The rule appears to be that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to this specific color, irrespective of its position in the input.

Rule: bluf -> green",0.0,180,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the corresponding color outputs in each example where ""walm"" appears:

1. bluf wif walm -> yellow red red red
2. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
3. dax walm -> green green green
4. walm wif -> yellow yellow red
5. dax walm -> green green green

One pattern that immediately stands out is that after ""walm"" the same color is repeated:

1. red red red
2. yellow yellow
3. green green
4. yellow yellow
5. green green

It appears that ""walm"" causes the next word's associated color to repeat multiple times. Now, let's see what color each repeated word corresponds to (ignoring ""walm""):

1. wif -> red
2. zup -> yellow
3. dax -> green
4. wif -> red
5. dax -> green

Using the context of each sentence, this is the inferred rule:

walm -> Causes the next word's color to be repeated twice more, for a total of three consecutive appearances of that color.

Rule: If the next word corresponds to a color, ""walm"" causes that color to appear three times in a row.",1.0,180,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we will analyze the patterns of the input and corresponding output colors:

- In every example where ""walm"" is used, the output is a series of ""green.""
- ""walm"" does not have a one-to-one correspondence with a single color, but instead seems to be followed by multiple ""green"" outputs.
- The number of ""green"" outputs following ""walm"" seems to be based on its position in the sequence. The first instance of ""walm"" yields three greens, the second instance two greens, and so on.
- Given that other words have consistent outputs (ex., ""dax"" -> green, ""wif"" -> red, ""zup"" -> yellow), ""walm"" appears to have a role in generating multiple greens in a pattern rather than associating with a fixed color.

With these observations, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> The word ""walm"" is followed by a number of ""green"" in the output equivalent to the number of words that follow ""walm"" in the input sequence.",0.9,180,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", let's look at the patterns of colors associated with each input word and how they map to outputs in the provided examples:

1. dax appears to map to green every time it is mentioned.
2. wif appears to map to red every time it is mentioned.
3. zup appears to map to yellow when followed by other words, but not when followed by ""walm"".
4. bluf appears to map to red, except when followed immediately by ""walm"" after which the output is green.
5. lug is mentioned once and it maps to blue.
6. walm does not have a consistent output color. However, when ""walm"" is present, the output color sequence seems to extend with additional greens.

From these observations, the occurrences of ""walm"" are correlated with a sequence of greens (""green green"" or ""green green green"") immediately following its position. Consequently, ""walm"" seems to indicate a repetition of the color green, possibly for the number of times that there are words following ""walm"". The ""walm"" itself does not correspond to a new color but instead modifies the output based on its position and the number of words following it.

Rule: walm -> indicates a sequence of green outputs corresponding to the number of words that follow ""walm"" in the input. If ""walm"" is the last word, it has no effect on the sequence of colors.",0.9,180,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's analyze how it translates in the context of each provided example:

1. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

2. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

3. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

4. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

5. Input: zup dax walm
   Output: yellow green green green

From the examples, we can see the following mappings for single words:
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow (assuming ""bluf"" is a typo and should be ""zup"" based on example 1)

If we look at the single word outputs and then at the context where ""walm"" is used, we can notice that ""walm"" appears to always output more than one color and the color sequence always ends with green (evident in examples 1, 3, 4, and 5).

- In example 1: ""walm"" -> red red red
- In example 2: ""walm"" doesn't directly translate to a sequence since it is followed by another word (lug).
- In example 3: ""walm"" -> green green
- In example 4: ""walm"" -> yellow yellow
- In example 5: ""walm"" -> green green

Analyzing the pattern, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color output of the word directly preceding it and ends with green:

1. wif (red) is before walm -> red red red (wif red, additional red, ending in green)
3. dax (green) is before walm -> green green (repeating the green from dax, ending in green)
4. zup (yellow) is before walm -> yellow yellow yellow (repeating the yellow from zup, ending in red from wif)
5. dax (green) is before walm -> green green (repeating the green from dax, ending in green)

In summary, ""walm"" seems to imply a rule where it repeats the color output of the previous word and always ends with the color green.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word as many times up to the third to the last color, always ending with green.",0.8,180,walm
"Analyzing the input and output pairs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""walm"".

From the given examples:
1. Where ""walm"" appears, we see a repetition of ""red"" in the output: 
   - Example 1: ""walm"" precedes three instances of ""red"".
   - Example 2: ""walm"" is followed by two instances of ""yellow"", but the pattern is not consistent with other examples.
   - Example 3: ""walm"" results in three instances of ""green"".
   - Example 4: ""walm"" results in three ""yellow"" afterwards.
   - Example 5: ""walm"" results in three ""green"" again.

Looking for consistency, we can somewhat rule out the idea that ""walm"" corresponds directly to a specific color because it does not consistently map to a single output. However, there does seem to be a repeating pattern after the ""walm"", suggesting that ""walm"" may prompt repetition of the next color.

Let's verify this with the examples:
- Example 1: After ""walm"", ""red"" is repeated three times.
- Example 2: Inconsistent with the repeating pattern.
- Example 3: After ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated three times.
- Example 4: After ""walm"", ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- Example 5: After ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated three times.

All examples except the second one follow a pattern where ""walm"" introduces a sequence of three repetitions of the following color.

Given the inconsistency found in the second example, it's possible that our dataset is incomplete or that there's a missing rule or information we're not considering. However, based on the existing examples, a tentative rule could be:

Rule: ""walm"" prompts the repetition of the next color mentioned three times. The second example may include an exception or error, or perhaps other contextual rules are affecting the output that is not immediately apparent.

Hence, a possible rule induction:
walm -> causes the next color to be repeated three times.",0.8,180,walm
"Based on the given examples:

- When 'dax lug' is input, the output is 'green blue'. Because 'dax' on its own typically outputs 'green', we can deduct that 'lug' by itself corresponds to 'blue'.
- When 'lug' is input by itself, the output is 'blue', which reinforces the prior deduction.
- When 'lug zup dax zup' is input, the output is 'blue yellow green yellow'. We know 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow' and 'dax' to 'green', so 'lug' here also aligns with 'blue'.
- When 'zup wif lug' is input, the output is 'yellow red blue'. We know 'zup' results in 'yellow', and there is no established meaning for 'wif', but since 'lug' appears at the end as in prior examples and the last color is 'blue', it again points to 'lug' meaning 'blue'.

Rule: lug -> blue.",1.0,181,lug
"Rule: lug -> blue

Explanation: In all the given examples, regardless of the position or combinations of words, whenever the word 'lug' is present, the output always includes the color 'blue'.",1.0,181,lug

"lug -> blue. 

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every provided example.",1.0,181,lug
"From the given examples, we can notice a pattern regarding the appearance of the word ""dax"" and the corresponding color in the output. Here's the pattern:

- In the first example, the input ""dax"" corresponds to a ""green"" output.
- In the second and fourth examples, whenever ""dax"" is present, ""green"" consistently follows its position, regardless of the other words around it.
- Similarly, in the third and fifth examples, ""dax"" is followed by a ""green"" output, confirming that ""dax"" directly translates to ""green.""

It appears that the word ""dax"" consistently equates to the color ""green"" in the output, no matter the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence or the presence of other words. Therefore, we can deduce the rule as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,181,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"":

dax -> green

Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""green."" Hence, the rule seems to be consistent across all given examples, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the sequence or the other words present.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,181,dax
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output every time it appears in the input. Regardless of its position in the input sequence, ""dax"" is consistently translated to ""green."" 

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,181,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

Whenever the word ""dax"" is presented, it corresponds to the color ""green."" Each instance of the nonce word ""dax"" in the input sequences is consistently matched with the color green in the output. Other words correspond with different colors, but ""dax"" is uniquely paired with green in each provided example.",1.0,181,dax
"From the provided examples, we can see a consistent pattern where each instance of the word 'dax' corresponds to the color 'green' in the output. From each pairing of input and output, 'dax' is the only word that consistently translates to 'green,' regardless of its position in the sequence. Other words map to different colors, such as 'zup' to 'yellow,' 'bluf' to 'yellow,' 'wif' to 'red,' and 'lug' to 'blue.' There are no contradictions in the given examples for the mapping of 'dax' to 'green.'

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,181,dax
"Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color red.",1.0,181,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's examine the color pattern in the output every time ""wif"" is used in the input. 

In the first example, ""wif"" appears between ""zup"" and ""bluf"" and the output colors are ""yellow red red."" Since ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"" in the output of the second example as well, we can infer that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" So, it's possible that ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red"" in the sequence.

In the second example ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" which adds an extra ""red"" compared to the first example. It looks like ""walm"" could correspond to ""red"" here.

In the third example, ""wif"" appears at the end, and the output ends in ""red,"" while ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue."" 

When ""wif"" is at the beginning or in the middle (with ""dax"" following or preceding it), it corresponds to ""red"" while ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" This last part can also be justified because ""dax wif"" inverses the output sequence to ""green red,"" meaning the position of ""wif"" affects the output sequence, but consistently has ""red"" associated with it.

Based on these examples, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. The position of ""wif"" in the input doesn't change the output color, which is always ""red"" when ""wif"" is present.

Rule: wif -> ""red""",1.0,181,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red regardless of its position in the input. In each example, when ""wif"" is present, the output includes ""red"". This suggests that ""wif"" refers to the color red, and its position (whether it's at the beginning, the middle, or the end of the sequence) does not alter its corresponding color.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,181,wif
"Rule: ""wif"" translates to the word ""red"".",1.0,181,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we must look at its position and the resulting colors in each example:

1. ""zup wif bluf"" results in ""yellow red red""
2. ""zup wif walm"" results in ""yellow red red red""
3. ""lug bluf wif"" results in ""blue blue red""
4. ""wif dax"" results in ""red green""
5. ""dax wif"" results in ""green red""

Let's analyze the occurrences of ""wif"":

- When ""wif"" is between two known words, the color ""red"" appears. This occurs in all examples except the 4th, where ""wif"" starts the sequence. 
- In examples 1 and 2, ""wif"" is between ""zup"" (yellow) and another word, and ""red"" follows ""yellow,"" with the sequence ending in ""red.""
- In example 3, ""wif"" ends the sequence and still has ""red"" following the colors corresponding to the previous words.
- Examples 4 and 5 suggest that ""wif"" before or after ""dax"" (green) results in ""red"" before or after ""green"" respectively.

Based on these observations, it appears that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red,"" but there's an additional rule regarding its position in the sequence and how the colors are ordered. The presence of ""wif"" leads to ""red"" either following or preceding the color word it is paired with.

Rule: ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red,"" and its position in the sequence influences whether ""red"" comes before or after the color it is associated with. For instance, when ""wif"" precedes another color word, ""red"" comes before the color word's associated color in the output. When ""wif"" follows another color word, ""red"" comes after the color word's associated color in the output.",0.8,181,wif
"zup -> meaning. The word ""zup"" corresponds with the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present.

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the color yellow is included in the output in place of ""zup"".",1.0,181,zup
"By reviewing the provided examples, we can observe the following patterns:

1. Every time ""zup"" appears after a sequence of words, it is translated into the word ""yellow.""
2. It doesn't seem to matter where ""zup"" appears in the sequence (beginning, middle, or end); the corresponding output is always ""yellow.""
3. The presence of other words such as ""lug,"" ""wif,"" ""dax,"" ""walm,"" or ""bluf"" are associated with other specific colors (""lug"" with ""blue,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" ""walm"" with ""green,"" and ""bluf"" with ""red""), but ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow"" regardless of their presence or order.

So, we can induce that the rule for ""zup"" is consistent and independent of its position or the other words around it.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,181,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Explanation: In each instance where the word ""zup"" appears, the corresponding output is ""yellow"", regardless of its position in the input sequence. It suggests that ""zup"" directly translates to the color ""yellow"".",1.0,181,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- walm -> green
- bluf -> red

The word ""zup"" appears to have a consistent output of ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input string. It is not influenced by the words around it and always maps to the same color. Thus, the rule for ""zup"" would be:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,181,zup
"The task involves decoding the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" based on the input-output relationships presented in the examples. To deduce the rule, it's necessary to examine where ""zup"" appears and analyze the corresponding output.

- In the first example (""lug wif dax walm zup""), the output corresponds to the sequence ""blue red green green green yellow."" ""Zup"" comes after ""walm,"" and ""yellow"" is the output associated with it.
- In the second example (""wif lug zup""), ""zup"" comes after ""lug,"" and ""yellow"" appears again in the output.
- In the third example (""dax zup wif bluf lug""), ""zup"" is surrounded by ""dax"" and ""wif,"" and ""yellow"" is in the corresponding output position.
- In the fourth example (""zup walm""), ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" and both lead to ""yellow"" in the output.
- In the fifth example (""dax bluf wif zup""), ""zup"" appears at the end, and ""yellow"" follows in the output.

The consistent rule across all examples is that whenever ""zup"" is present in the input, regardless of its position or the surrounding words, the corresponding output is always ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,181,zup
"Rule: ""bluf"" indicates that the color output should be repeated once.

This is shown by the examples where the word before ""bluf"" corresponds to a color, and the output for ""bluf"" is to repeat that color:

- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"" (the color ""red"" appears twice)
- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"" (the color ""yellow"" appears twice)
- ""lug bluf"" would then imply ""blue blue"" if ""lug"" corresponded to ""blue"" based on the ""dax lug bluf dax"" sequence.

Therefore, bluf -> meaning. ""bluf"" means to repeat the color word that appears immediately before it in the sequence.",1.0,181,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" results in the output of two identical colors. The color that is outputted seems to correspond to the word that directly precedes ""bluf"". For instance, when ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow,"" and when ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red."" Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: bluf -> the color corresponding to the preceding word, duplicated.",1.0,181,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. Meaning appears to be repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. 

Rule: When the nonce word bluf follows another word, it causes the output to repeat the color that corresponds to that word. 
- ""zup wif bluf"" yields ""yellow red red,"" thus bluf causes ""red"" to be repeated following ""wif.""
- ""zup bluf"" yields ""yellow yellow,"" thus bluf causes ""yellow"" to be repeated following ""zup.""
- ""dax lug bluf dax"" yields ""green blue blue green,"" thus bluf causes ""blue"" to be repeated following ""lug.""
- ""wif bluf"" yields ""red red,"" confirming that bluf causes ""red"" to be repeated following ""wif.""
- ""zup bluf dax lug"" yields ""yellow yellow green blue,"" wherein bluf causes ""yellow"" to be repeated following ""zup.""",1.0,181,bluf
Rule: bluf -> repeats the color associated with the previous word.,1.0,181,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can observe the following patterns:

- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""yellow yellow"".
- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"".
- ""dax lug bluf dax"" results in ""green blue blue green"".
- When ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax lug"", the output is ""yellow yellow green blue"".

The patterns suggest that ""bluf"" takes the color from the word preceding it and repeats it. If ""bluf"" is at the end of the series or if there is no distinct color-related word just before it, it does not appear to have a direct effect (since there's no previous word in the ""zup bluf"" example to determine its color from). However, ""bluf"" is consistent in repeating the color of the word just before it.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the word immediately before it.",0.8,181,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to determine the meaning or rule underlying the nonce word ""walm"".

Let's first look at the colors associated with other words and how they figure in the different examples. 

From examples 1 and 2:
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""

From examples 3, 4, and 5:
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"" (assuming it directly correlates given example 3)
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green""
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red""

Now, observing the output related to ""walm"":

Example 1: ""zup walm lug"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue""
Example 2: ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
Example 3: ""wif dax lug walm"" -> ""red green blue blue blue""
Example 4: ""dax zup walm wif"" -> ""green yellow yellow yellow red""
Example 5: ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow""

The presence of the word ""walm"" appears to add a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. ""Walm"" does not seem to have a color of its own but reflects the color associated with the word immediately before it in the sequence. 

For example:
- In Example 1, ""walm"" follows ""zup"", and it adds two more ""yellow"" to the output.
- In Example 3, ""walm"" follows ""lug"", resulting in two additional ""blue"" in the output.

Hence, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be about repetition. It repeats the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word in the sequence.",1.0,181,walm
"Based on the provided examples, each instance of ""walm"" corresponds to three occurrences of the color indicated by the word prior to ""walm"". For instance:

- In ""zup walm lug"", ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", and then ""walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"", and ""lug"" follows with ""blue"".
- In ""wif dax lug walm"", ""walm"" again follows ""lug"" which is ""blue"", resulting in ""blue blue blue"".

Hence, the rule for ""walm"" could be described as follows:

walm -> Replicates the color three times indicated by the preceding word.

Rule:
If X is the color indicated by the word immediately preceding ""walm"", then ""walm"" means ""X X X"".",1.0,181,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the correspondence between the input and the output in each example. Specifically, we need to determine what aspect of the outputs each occurrence of ""walm"" explains.

- In the first example, ""walm"" appears to add three yellow elements at the end of the output.
- In the second example, without ""lug,"" ""walm"" accounts for three yellow elements, which suggests that ""lug"" is not related to the number of yellows.
- In the third example, ""walm"" results in three blue elements at the end.
- In the fourth and fifth examples, the occurrence of ""walm"" also results in repeating a color three times.

Considering these patterns from the examples, it seems that ""walm"" might mean to repeat the immediately preceding color three times. The varying colors that precede ""walm"" in the examples (yellow, blue, red) are repeated exactly three times after it.

Rule: walm -> repeat the previous color three times.",1.0,181,walm
"Based on the provided examples, each time the nonce word ""walm"" appears, it is added with a sequence of ""yellow"" words in the outputs. The number of ""yellow"" words equals the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence. Thus, we can deduce the following rule:

Walm -> Replicates the color word that precedes it, in the amount corresponding to its position in the input sequence.

Rule: If ""walm"" is the n-th word in the input, it outputs the color word of its preceding word repeated n times. If ""walm"" is the first word, it defaults to repeating ""yellow.""",0.8,181,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in each input and its corresponding output:

1. ""zup walm lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""zup walm"" must translate to ""yellow yellow yellow.""

2. ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow."" This indicates that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""walm"" generates two instances of ""yellow.""

3. ""wif dax lug walm"" translates to ""red green blue blue blue."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" Thus, ""walm"" contributes two more instances of the color that precedes it, ""blue.""

4. ""dax zup walm wif"" translates to ""green yellow yellow yellow red."" Hence, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" Based on this pattern, ""walm"" repeats the preceding color thrice.

5. ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow."" This supports the idea that ""walm"" repeats the preceding color.

Based on these examples, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it repeats the color corresponding to the word that precedes it three times.

Rule: walm -> repeats the preceding color three times.",0.8,181,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: Based on the examples provided, every instance of the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.",1.0,182,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.",1.0,182,lug
"Based on the given examples, each instance of ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,182,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,182,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""lug"" consistently results in the output ""blue."" Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,182,lug
"Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green"" consistently, regardless of its position in the input. Thus, it does not seem to depend on the context or the surrounding words. The rule can be deduced as:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,182,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer the meaning of ""dax."" Let's analyze:

1. When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green."" 
2. When ""dax"" appears before ""wif,"" the output is ""green red.""
3. When ""dax"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""green.""
4. When ""dax"" appears at the end of a sequence following ""zup,"" the output is ""green.""
5. When ""dax"" appears twice in a sequence, with ""wif"" and ""zup"" in between, both instances of ""dax"" correspond to ""green.""

Based on this analysis, we can deduce that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of the position in the sequence. The consistent output associated with each occurrence of ""dax"" is ""green."" Therefore, we can conclude that:

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" appears in an input sequence, the output is ""green.""",1.0,182,dax

"Rule: dax -> green

Justification: In every example, whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output always includes the word ""green"" at the corresponding position where ""dax"" is found. This consistency across all examples points to the rule that ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""",1.0,182,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" can be identified as follows:

- For every occurrence of ""wif"" in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" can be deduced to be ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,182,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we observe its corresponding outputs in each provided example. Here's the mapping of each nonce word to its color counterpart:

Example 1: ""zup lug zup wif dax"" -> ""yellow blue yellow red green""
Example 2: ""zup dax lug wif dax"" -> ""yellow green blue red green""
Example 3: ""wif dax zup dax"" -> ""red green yellow green""
Example 4: ""lug zup wif"" -> ""blue yellow red""
Example 5: ""dax zup walm wif walm"" -> ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red""

Observing these cases, we infer the following:

- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green""

In the examples that include ""wif,"" the word ""red"" always appears immediately after the word ""wif"". Even when multiple occurrences of ""walm"" appear after ""wif,"" each instance of ""walm"" translates to ""red."" Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that ""wif"" translates to ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red.",1.0,182,wif
"Based on the examples provided, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" in every instance. It appears that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color, and ""wif"" is no exception. The corresponding color words in the Output are distinct and do not vary based on position or context, indicating that the rules for the translation are consistent and direct.

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" is:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,182,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,182,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in each example provided. Regardless of its position in the sequence, ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red"".",1.0,182,wif

4. Input: wif zup

Looking at the data, ""zup"" always corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output. It does not seem to matter where ""zup"" appears in the sequence or which words are around it. The word ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow,"" suggesting that ""zup"" could simply mean ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,182,zup
"Based on the given examples, we need to determine the rule that defines what ""zup"" means in the context of transforming a sequence of nonce words into a sequence of colors.

Here are the observations:

- In every output sequence, the color ""yellow"" appears immediately after the word ""zup"" is used in the input.
- ""Zup"" does not correspond to a specific color independent of its position; instead, it influences the position immediately following it to be ""yellow.""
  
This means that regardless of what comes before or after ""zup,"" its presence in the sequence always results in ""yellow"" being in the output immediately after its position.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow"" (always results in the output color ""yellow"" immediately following its position in the sequence)",1.0,182,zup
"Based on the provided examples, each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. The pattern in which ""zup"" is used consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" 

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow

Meaning that ""zup"" translates to the color yellow.",1.0,182,zup
"Analyzing the given examples, it appears that each word correlates with a specific color and ""zup"" corresponds with a specific color regardless of its position in the sequence. This is indicated by ""zup"" always resulting in the color yellow in the output, regardless of the words that precede or follow it.

Based on the examples:

- ""dax"" consistently results in the color ""green.""
- ""wif"" consistently results in the color ""red.""
- ""walm"" consistently results in the color ""red.""
- ""lug"" consistently results in the color ""blue.""
- ""bluf,"" showing up only once, seems to correlate with the color ""yellow."" However, since ""zup"" also results in ""yellow,"" this could be coincidental.

Given this information, we can deduce the rule for ""zup"" as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow. The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the other words present.",1.0,182,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following:

- When the word ""zup"" appears after ""dax"", the output is ""green yellow"".
- When the word ""zup"" appears after ""lug"", the output is ""yellow blue"".
- When the word ""zup"" appears after ""wif"", the output is ""red yellow"".

The consistent pattern here is that the word following ""zup"" in the input seems to determine the color immediately after ""yellow"" in the output. Therefore, we can induce that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" followed by the color corresponding to the next word in the sequence:

- dax -> green, so ""dax zup"" leads to ""green yellow"".
- wif -> red, so ""wif zup"" leads to ""red yellow"".
- lug -> blue, so ""lug zup"" leads to ""yellow blue"".

However, when ""zup"" is the first word in the sequence (as seen in the last example: ""zup lug""), its assumed meaning of ""yellow"" remains unchanged and is followed by the color corresponding to ""lug"", which is ""blue"".

In sum:

zup -> yellow. Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and is followed by the color corresponding to the next word in the sequence. If ""zup"" is the first word, it is simply followed by the color corresponding to the next word.",1.0,182,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color immediately preceding it. Here's a breakdown of each example and how ""bluf"" relates to the preceding color:

1. In the sequence ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup,"" ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"" and ""lug"" correlates with ""blue."" Whenever ""bluf"" appears directly after ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow,"" and when ""bluf"" appears directly after ""lug,"" the output is ""blue."" This suggests that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it.

2. In the sequence ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm,"" ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"" and ""dax"" correlates with ""green."" When ""bluf"" appears after ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow."" The word ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" and since ""wif"" appears after ""bluf,"" it does not affect ""bluf's"" interpretation as the color changes to ""red"" only after ""bluf.""

3. The sequence ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" also supports this observation. ""Zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" with ""blue."" When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow.""

4. The sequence ""wif bluf"" provides an output of ""red red,"" which means that ""bluf"" took on the color associated with ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

5. The sequence ""dax bluf"" provides an output of ""green green,"" meaning that ""bluf"" took on the color associated with ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" mirrors the color of the word that comes immediately before it. If no color precedes it for some reason (not evidenced in the provided data), a default or another rule might need to be determined, but that is not the case in the given examples.

So, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it.",1.0,182,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. If there is no word before bluf, then it defaults to red.",1.0,182,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to be directly related to the color that precedes it. In every instance where the nonce word ""bluf"" appears, the color it outputs is the same as the color that corresponds to the nonce word before it. Here are the patterns observed:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and ""lug"", which correspond to ""yellow"" and ""blue"", respectively. Both instances of ""bluf"" then produce ""yellow"" and ""blue"" in the same sequence.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"", and the output is ""yellow"" again for ""bluf"".
- The third example is similar to the first, with ""bluf"" following ""zup"" and outputting ""yellow"".
- The fourth and fifth examples show ""wif"" and ""dax"" preceding ""bluf"", with outputs of ""red"" and ""green"" respectively, matching the color preceding them.

So, the rule appears to be:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" outputs the color associated with the immediately preceding nonce word.

Therefore,

bluf -> meaning: ""bluf"" means repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,182,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" translates to the color that precedes the word ""bluf"" in the input. Here's the rule inferred:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows the color words ""zup"" and ""lug"", and in the output, the colors ""yellow"" and ""blue"" appear before ""green"" which is the color for ""dax"". Thus, ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes it (yellow and blue).
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow"", the same as ""zup"".
- In the third example, ""bluf"" again follows ""zup"" and the color is ""yellow"".
- The fourth example is just ""wif bluf"" and the output is ""red red"", suggesting that ""bluf"" here takes the color of ""wif"", which is ""red"".
- The fifth example has ""dax bluf"" with the output ""green green"", again indicating that ""bluf"" takes the color of ""dax"" which is ""green"".

Rule: bluf -> The word ""bluf"" translates to the color associated with the word that directly precedes it.",1.0,182,bluf
"bluf -> word meaning ""yellow""

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output is yellow. When ""bluf"" is preceded by any other word, it takes on the color of the preceding word. For example, when preceded by ""dax"" (green), ""bluf"" translates to green. When preceded by ""wif"" (red), ""bluf"" translates to red.",0.0,182,bluf
"Based on the examples provided:

- ""dax walm zup"" leads to ""green green green yellow"", while ""lug walm zup"" leads to ""blue blue blue yellow"". This shows that walm takes on the color of the word that appears before it, as ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""dax lug wif walm"" leads to ""green blue red red red"", which further supports the idea that walm takes the color of the preceding word as ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"", again showing that walm assumes the color of the previous word, with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"".
- ""dax walm"" yields ""green green green"", sticking to the rule that walm matches the color of the word before it, here ""dax"" which is ""green"".

Rule: walm -> takes on the color of the preceding word.",1.0,182,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can observe the following pattern:

1. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green.""
2. When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
3. When ""zup"" precedes or follows ""walm,"" the output includes ""yellow.""
4. When ""dax"" and ""lug"" precede ""wif walm,"" the output includes ""red red red"" for the ""wif walm"" part.
5. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" on its own, the output is ""green green green,"" consistent with the first example.
6. When ""zup"" is adjacent to ""walm"" the output is consistent ""yellow yellow yellow,"" regardless of the position of ""zup.""

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" directly affects the color repeated in the output, but the specific color seems dependent on the word that directly precedes ""walm."" 

- ""dax"" before ""walm"" results in ""green"" being repeated.
- ""lug"" before ""walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated.
- ""zup"" adjacent to ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" being repeated.
- The example with ""wif"" does not clearly contribute to the rule induction for ""walm"" since ""wif"" never occurs without other color-inducing words.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes repetition of the color output associated with the word that directly precedes it. However, there is an exception with ""zup"" where the position does not matter; ""walm"" and ""zup"" together always yield ""yellow.""

Rule: walm -> Causes the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, with ""zup"" being an exception where the color ""yellow"" is output whether ""zup"" precedes or follows ""walm.""",0.9,182,walm
"Based on the given examples, we see that whenever the nonce word ""walm"" appears in the input, the corresponding output consists of repetitions of a color word: green, blue, or yellow. The number of repetitions corresponds to the number of words before ""walm"" in the input sequence. The color itself corresponds to the word just before ""walm"":

- ""dax walm zup"" -> ""green green green yellow"" (here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"")
- ""lug walm zup"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow"" (here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"")
- ""dax lug wif walm"" -> ""green blue red red red"" (here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"")
- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"" (here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"")
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"" (here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"")

There is no example provided with ""walm"" occurring as the first word, so we do not know the behavior in that instance. However, from the examples provided, we can induct the rule that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word, the number of repetitions equals the number of words preceding ""walm"".

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color that corresponds to the immediate preceding word, the number of times equal to the count of words before ""walm"".",0.9,182,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm"" from the given examples, we need to analyze the input and the corresponding output colors. Here are the observations:

1. When ""dax"" and ""walm"" are present together, the output is ""green green green"". Since ""dax"" by itself is not shown in the examples, we can infer that either ""dax"" or ""walm"" (or both) maps to the color green.
   
2. In the case of ""lug walm zup"", the output is ""blue blue blue yellow"". We have an instance of ""lug"" and ""walm"" together again producing three of the same color (blue in this case) and ""zup"" mapping to yellow.

3. With ""dax lug wif walm,"" the output is ""green blue red red red,"" suggesting that ""dax"" maps to green, ""lug"" maps to blue, and ""wif"" maps to red. Since ""walm"" is present at the end and only red follows it thrice, it might denote repetition of the color associated with the prior word.

4. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which supports the idea that ""walm"" indicates repetition because ""zup"" maps to yellow, and ""walm"" here would mean repeating the color yellow associated with ""zup"".

5. Lastly, ""dax walm"" maps to ""green green green"" which again supports the rule that ""walm"" causes repetition of the color of the preceding word.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be a function that implies repetition of the color associated with the preceding word two additional times (as it was mentioned three times in the output, including the original color associated with that word).

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the preceding word two additional times.",0.9,182,walm
"From the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" is a word that takes on the color attribute of the word immediately preceding it. Here's how I deduce the rule:

1. In ""dax walm zup,"" ""dax"" leads to ""green"" and ""walm"" also leads to ""green"" (followed by ""zup"" which leads to ""yellow"").
2. In ""lug walm zup,"" ""lug"" leads to ""blue"" and ""walm"" also leads to ""blue"" (followed by ""zup"" which leads to ""yellow"").
3. In ""dax lug wif walm,"" ""walm"" takes on the color attribute of ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

Regardless of its position in a series of nonce words that correlate to specific colors, ""dax"" consistently results in the color green in the output. Each instance is independent of the surrounding words, leading to the conclusion that ""dax"" is not context-dependent in this scenario.

"By examining the examples provided and their corresponding outputs, we can attempt to induce the rule that governs the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"". Let's analyze each one.

1. Input: wif dax zup bluf
   Output: red green yellow yellow
2. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
   Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
3. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
4. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue
5. Input: zup bluf dax
   Output: yellow yellow green

Looking at the placement of ""bluf"" and the colors that follow in each example, we try to identify a pattern:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", and the output is a repetition of the previous color, ""yellow"".
- In the second example, ""bluf"" again follows ""zup"", and it repeats the previous color, ""yellow"".
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", and it repeats the previous color, ""red"".
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", and the output is ""blue blue"". This is the only instance where ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", and it may be that ""lug"" itself translates to ""blue"", resulting in a repeat of the color.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" again, and ""yellow"" is repeated as before.

Given the evidence, ""bluf"" appears to repeat the color of the word that precedes it. This leads us to deduce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,183,bluf
"From the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" directly translates to the color ""yellow."" Every instance where ""bluf"" is mentioned, the output color is ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> yellow.",1.0,183,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word that immediately precedes it. Here’s how this pattern plays out in the examples:

- In the first example, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output for ""zup"" is ""yellow."" Consequently, the output for ""bluf"" is also ""yellow.""
- The second example confirms this pattern, as ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" twice and each time ""bluf"" outputs ""yellow,"" which is the same output as ""zup.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output for ""wif"" is ""red,"" thus the output for ""bluf"" is also ""red.""
- The fourth example shows ""lug"" preceding ""bluf"" and both output ""blue.""
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and once again, the output color for both ""zup"" and ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""

From these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" can be described as follows:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word that comes before it.

If the word before bluf is:
- ""wif"" -> bluf is red
- ""dax"" -> bluf is green
- ""zup"" -> bluf is yellow
- ""lug"" -> bluf is blue

Based on the given data, the pattern is consistent, and this rule accounts for all examples.",1.0,183,bluf
"From the examples provided, each input word correlates to a specific color output. To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine the instances where ""bluf"" is used and its corresponding output:

2. Example 2: ""bluf"" again corresponds to ""yellow"" (twice)
3. Example 3: ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""
4. Example 4: ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue""
5. Example 5: ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow""

In three out of five cases, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow."" However, in one case it corresponds to ""red,"" and in another case to ""blue."" This inconsistency could suggest that ""bluf"" may not have a fixed color as its output, but rather the output might be influenced by other factors such as position or surrounding words. Yet, with the current examples, there is no clear pattern that determines when ""bluf"" changes its output from yellow to another color. Given the available data, the best rule we can determine is as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" typically corresponds to ""yellow,"" but under unspecified conditions, it may correspond to either ""red"" or ""blue"". Further examples and context would be needed to understand the underlying conditions that govern these changes.",0.6,183,bluf

"Walm -> The color before walm is repeated for the next series of colors until a different color word appears.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" is encountered, it duplicates the color associated with the previous word, continuing this pattern until a new color word is introduced.

Evidence supporting this rule:

- In the first example, ""dax walm wif zup"" corresponds to ""green green green red yellow."" After ""dax,"" which translates to green, ""walm"" repeats the color green until ""wif"" changes it to red.
  
- In the second example, ""wif walm"" simply duplicates the red color associated with ""wif.""

- In the third example, ""zup wif walm lug"" starts with yellow for ""zup,"" changes to red for ""wif,"" then ""walm"" repeats the red until ""lug,"" which changes the color to blue.

- In the fourth example, ""zup walm lug wif"" begins with yellow for ""zup,"" then ""walm"" repeats the yellow until ""lug"" changes it to blue, finally ""wif"" changes it to red.

- In the fifth example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif,"" we see that ""wif"" is red, ""bluf"" is red (even though ""bluf"" isn't directly given a color, it keeps the color sequence consistent), ""dax"" is green, followed by another ""bluf"" which is green, ""wif"" turns it back to red, ""walm"" duplicates the red twice until ""lug"" which is blue, followed by the last ""wif"" turning it back to red again.",1.0,183,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" is associated with the output of consecutive repeated colors. The color that is repeated is the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""walm."" Here is the rule induction based on the examples:

- In the first example, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green."" This implies that ""walm"" causes the color for ""dax"" (green) to be repeated three times.

- In the second example, ""wif walm"" generates ""red red red."" Similarly, ""walm"" causes the color for ""wif"" (red) to be repeated three times.

- In the third example, ""wif walm"" within the sequence ""zup wif walm lug"" results in the color for ""wif"" being repeated three times, ignoring ""zup"" and ""lug"" that occur before and after ""wif walm.""

- In the fourth example, ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which shows that ""walm"" repeats the color for ""zup.""

- In the fifth example, ""wif walm"" again results in the color for ""wif"" being repeated three times, regardless of other words that come before or after.

Rule: Walm -> A rule that causes the color associated with the word directly preceding ""walm"" to be repeated three times.",1.0,183,walm
"walm -> meaning. Rule:

Analyzing the patterns of input and corresponding output, one can identify how the nonce word ""walm"" might affect the output sequence. Each time ""walm"" is present, it causes all colors following ""walm"" (including the color immediately after ""walm"") up to the next nonce word to repeat the color that ""walm"" itself caused.

Example deductions are as follows:

- In the first input, ""dax walm wif zup,"" we see that ""dax"" corresponds to green, and after ""walm"" both ""wif"" and ""zup"" are green—up until the next nonce word after ""walm,"" which in this case is ""zup"" which then changes the pattern to yellow.

- In the second input, ""wif walm,"" there is no color after ""walm"" for the repetition to occur. However, ""wif"" is consistently red.

- In the third input, ""zup wif walm lug,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" to red, and then ""walm"" causes ""lug"" to also be red—up until the next nonce word.

- In the fourth input, ""zup walm lug wif,"" we notice that ""walm"" causes the words ""lug"" and ""wif"" immediately following it to be yellow, which is the color produced by ""zup.""

- In the fifth input, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif,"" we can see that ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" and another ""wif,"" both of which are red—matching the color for ""wif"" rather than the intervening ""bluf"" which is green.

From these observations, we can infer the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" causes all subsequent words up until the next nonce word to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding ""walm."" If ""walm"" is the last word, there are no subsequent colors to apply the rule to.",0.8,183,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", we must look for patterns before and after its appearance in the given examples. Here, we can see the following patterns:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output for ""walm"" is green.
2. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output pattern is red red red.
3. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""lug,"" it results in yellow yellow yellow.
4. When ""walm"" is preceded by either ""zup"" or ""wif,"" the output is always the same color repeated for each word's respective color.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word before it and repeats that output three times. In cases where there isn't a preceding color (like when ""dax"" is the first word), it defaults to green. Using this pattern:

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color of the preceding word three times. If there is no preceding color word, the default output color is green.",0.8,183,walm
"To figure out the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the colors associated with the word in various contexts. Let's examine the examples given:

1. Input: dax walm wif zup
    - Output: green green green red yellow
2. Input: wif walm
    - Output: red red red
3. Input: zup wif walm lug
    - Output: yellow red red red blue
4. Input: zup walm lug wif
    - Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
5. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
    - Output: red red green green red red red blue red

The pattern that seems to emerge is that the color associated with ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding ""walm"". Here is how it plays out in each example:

1. The word before ""walm"" is ""dax"", which outputs ""green"". Following ""walm"", the output is ""green green green"".
2. The word before ""walm"" is ""wif"", which outputs ""red"". Following ""walm"", the output is ""red red red"".
3. The word before ""walm"" is ""wif"", which outputs ""red"". Following ""walm"", the output is ""red red red"".
4. The word before ""walm"" is ""zup"", which outputs ""yellow"". Following ""walm"", the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"".
5. The word before ""walm"" is ""wif"", which outputs ""red"". Following ""walm"", the rule breaks down a bit because instead of the output being ""red red red red"", it's ""red red red blue red""; however, the first three repetitions of red still match our rule.

The last example introduces a little bit of uncertainty due to the extra ""red"" without a preceding word to justify it in terms of the rule. However, if we assume that ""lug"" following ""walm"" doesn't affect the ongoing pattern, the rule seems to hold.

So, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be: it repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word three times.",0.8,183,walm
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,184,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,1.0,184,lug
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following associations for the nonce words to colors:

- wif -> red
- walm -> yellow (repeated in ""walm"" as ""yellow yellow yellow"", thus it's likely that ""walm"" by itself is ""yellow"")

Now, let's look at ""lug"":

1. In the first example, ""zup lug"" becomes ""yellow blue"". Since ""zup"" is yellow, ""lug"" is blue.

2. In the second example, ""dax lug bluf"" becomes ""green blue blue"". We are given that ""dax"" is green and ""bluf"" is blue. Since the sequence includes ""blue"" twice after ""dax"", it's logical to conclude that ""lug"" is also blue here.

3. In the third example, ""lug wif dax zup walm"" becomes ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow"". Knowing the colors for ""wif"" (red), ""dax"" (green), ""zup"" (yellow), and ""walm"" (yellow), and seeing that ""lug"" is placed at the start and corresponds with ""blue"", ""lug"" is again blue.

4. In the fourth example, ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" becomes ""green green red yellow blue"". Since we know the colors of all words except ""lug"", which appears at the end as ""blue"", we can again deduce that ""lug"" is blue.

5. The fifth example is ""wif lug dax walm"" which becomes ""red blue green green green"". Here, ""wif"" is red, followed by ""lug"" which is blue, ""dax"" green, and ""walm"" which we have interpreted as yellow but is repeated as ""green green green"" for the sake of pattern continuity.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,184,zup
"Based on the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, we can attempt to deduce the rule that defines the meaning of the nonce word ""zup.""

- In every instance where ""zup"" appears, the output always begins with ""yellow.""
- It does not matter where ""zup"" appears in the input (beginning, middle, or end); the corresponding output always contains ""yellow"" at the point where ""zup"" appears.

Thus, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow

This suggests that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output regardless of its position or the presence of other words in the input.",1.0,184,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's first inspect each sentence to understand the correlation between the inputs and the color outputs:

1. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" correlates with ""green""
   - ""bluf"" correlates with ""green""

2. Input: zup dax lug
   Output: yellow green blue
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" correlates with ""green""
   - ""lug"" correlates with ""blue""

3. Input: zup bluf wif
   Output: yellow yellow red
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" correlates with ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" correlates with ""red""

4. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   - ""wif"" correlates with ""red""
   - ""walm"" might correlate with ""red""
   - ""dax"" correlates with ""red"" (which is a different correlation than in the prior examples)
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""

5. Input: zup lug
   Output: yellow blue
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" correlates with ""blue""

From these examples, it appears that ""zup"" consistently correlates with the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input string or the other words present.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,184,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow.""",1.0,184,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze the consistency of the output colors with the position of ""zup"" and the words accompanying it in each given input.

- When ""zup"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output starts with ""yellow green.""
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the output starts with ""yellow yellow.""
- When ""zup"" is alone with ""lug,"" the output is ""yellow blue.""
- When ""zup"" follows ""wif walm dax,"" the output contains ""yellow"" at the fifth position, which corresponds to the position of ""zup.""

Looking at these patterns, it seems that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position or the words around it.

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,184,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns in the examples provided:

Input: dax bluf wif lug -> Output: green green red blue
Input: wif lug zup bluf -> Output: red blue yellow yellow
Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
Input: wif dax bluf -> Output: red green green
Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf -> Output: red green yellow red green green

Observing the patterns, it becomes evident that the output color for ""bluf"" is consistently the same as the color for the word that immediately precedes it. Let's verify this:

In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the color for both is green.
In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and the color for both is yellow.
In the third and fourth examples, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the color for both is red.

Therefore, we can establish the following rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color of the word immediately before it.",1.0,184,bluf
"Observing the input and output pairs provided, we can deduce a pattern for the nonce word ""bluf."" Here's the evaluation of each case:

1. In the first example, the word ""bluf"" aligns with the output ""blue."" This suggests that ""bluf"" might be associated with the color blue.

2. However, in the second example, ""bluf"" corresponds to an output of ""yellow."" This contradicts the idea that ""bluf"" always means blue.

3. In the third example, where only ""wif"" and ""bluf"" are present, the output is ""red red,"" which means that ""bluf"" here corresponds to the color red, yet again, a different color.

4. Similarly, in the fourth and fifth examples, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" and not to a consistent color each time.

After analyzing all examples, it becomes clear that ""bluf"" does not point to a specific color; instead, it seems to mirror the color associated with the word immediately before it in the sequence. In each case, the color value for ""bluf"" is the same as the color value for the word preceding it:

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and so does ""bluf"" that follows.
- In the second example, ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" that follows also gets ""yellow"" as the output.
- In the third and fifth examples, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" that follows also gives ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" again, and so does ""bluf"" that follows.

Therefore:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.",1.0,184,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the occurrence of the word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output. The output does not appear to depend on the position or context of ""bluf"" within the input sequence but is solely tied to the presence of ""bluf.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

bluf -> green

Rule: Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""green.""",1.0,184,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to identify patterns in the input-output pairs related to the presence of the word ""bluf."" 

Looking through the examples:

1. Input: dax bluf wif lug -> Output: green green red blue
2. Input: wif lug zup bluf -> Output: red blue yellow yellow
3. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
4. Input: wif dax bluf -> Output: red green green
5. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf -> Output: red green yellow red green green

From the first example, ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" in the output sequence. However, this doesn't hold in other examples where the presence of ""bluf"" doesn't translate to ""green."" 

Notably, in Example 3, when ""bluf"" directly follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red."" Similarly, in Example 4, when ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green."" In Example 5, which contains the sequence ""wif dax bluf,"" we see the pattern again with ""red green green.""

Based on these observations, it's possible to deduce that ""bluf"" causes the previous word's color output to be repeated. Therefore, ""bluf"" does not have a color associated with it; instead, its presence results in duplication of the color associated with the word that comes directly before it.

Rule: bluf -> Causes a repetition of the color associated with the previous word in the output sequence.",1.0,184,bluf
"bluf -> green

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color green.",0.4,184,bluf
"Upon examining the given inputs and their associated outputs, we can see that the word ""walm"" appears to consistently correspond to ""green green green"" in the output, regardless of the context or the other words in the sequence. Here's the breakdown of instances:

- ""dax lug walm"" leads to ""green blue blue blue,"" and we can identify ""green"" as the color associated with ""dax"" and ""blue"" with ""lug."" The word ""walm"" is followed by ""blue blue blue,"" which suggests that ""walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"" in this context. However, considering more examples, we see that ""lug"" actually corresponds to ""blue,"" and the additional ""blue blue"" is attributed to ""walm.""
- ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" gives ""green blue blue blue green red red green,"" and if we follow the pattern from above, ""walm"" again is followed by ""blue blue blue,"" despite the colors for ""dax"" being ""green"" and ""wif"" and ""bluf"" subsequently being ""red red."" 
- In ""wif bluf dax walm,"" we see ""red red green green green,"" further supporting that ""walm"" is followed by ""green green green.""
- ""zup dax walm zup wif"" results in ""yellow green green green yellow red,"" where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" leaving ""walm"" again followed by ""green green green.""
- Finally, ""lug zup dax walm"" gives ""blue yellow green green green,"" keeping consistent with the established pattern for the other words and revealing that ""walm"" is consistently followed by ""green green green.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
Rule: walm -> three consecutive greens (""green green green"").",1.0,184,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" one must look for patterns in the examples given. The examples provided show consistent results for other parts, such as ""dax"" always corresponding to ""green"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" 

In each example, ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color that follows the previous nonce word. The following analysis supports this observation:

Input: dax lug walm       
Output: green blue blue blue   
Analysis: ""dax"" is green, ""lug"" is blue, and ""walm"" results in a repeated sequence of blue.

Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax     
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green    
Analysis: ""walm"" follows the pattern of repeating the color blue, ""dax"" is green, ""wif"" is red, ""bluf"" is not explained but likely a typographical error intended to be ""wif"", repeating red again.

Input: wif bluf dax walm       
Output: red red green green green  
Analysis: ""wif"" is red, ""bluf"" is likely intended to be ""wif"" and thus red, ""dax"" is green, and ""walm"" repeats the green color.

Input: zup dax walm zup wif      
Output: yellow green green green yellow red  
Analysis: ""zup"" is yellow, ""dax"" is green, ""walm"" repeats the green, and ""wif"" results in red. 

Input: lug zup dax walm     
Output: blue yellow green green green  
Analysis: ""lug"" is blue, ""zup"" is yellow, ""dax"" is green, and ""walm"" repeats the green color.

Based on these analyses, the rule for walm can be described as follows:

Rule: walm -> when preceding a color designation, ""walm"" results in the repetition of that designated color one or more times.",1.0,184,walm
"walm -> meaning

Based on the examples provided where:

- ""dax lug walm"" corresponds to ""green blue blue blue""
- ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" corresponds to ""green blue blue blue green red red green""
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" corresponds to ""red red green green green""
- ""zup dax walm zup wif"" corresponds to ""yellow green green green yellow red""
- ""lug zup dax walm"" corresponds to ""blue yellow green green green""

Each instance of the word ""walm"" is followed by three instances of the word ""blue"" in the output:

""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue"" (with ""walm"" yielding ""blue blue blue"")
""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" includes ""walm"" followed again by ""blue blue blue""

In all the examples, ""walm"" does not correspond to a single color but a repetition of ""blue"" three times.

Rule:
walm -> three repetitions of the word ""blue""",1.0,184,walm
"Based on the examples given, the word ""walm"" seems to result in the word ""green"" being repeated three times in the output. It does not seem to matter which other words precede or follow ""walm,"" the outcome associated with ""walm"" remains consistent.

The other nonce words seem to produce a single color as well:
- ""dax"" results in ""green""
- ""lug"" results in ""blue""
- ""wif"" results in ""red""
- ""zup"" results in ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" also results in ""red""

Taking the above into account, here's the rule for ""walm"":

Therefore, the rule is: dax -> green.",1.0,185,dax

"Rule: wif -> red

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,185,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or the rule behind the nonce word ""wif"". Let's examine the instances where ""wif"" appears and the corresponding output:

- ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" -> ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue""

We can observe that every single time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the exact same position in the output. This regularity allows us to conclude that ""wif"" directly corresponds to the color ""red.""

So we can write the rule:

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in each example provided.",1.0,185,zup
"Observing the given examples and their respective outputs, it appears that ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" Now let's verify this for each example:

- Example 1: ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""green red yellow yellow red red red""
  Here, ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow"" which corresponds to ""wif"" and precedes ""red red"" which also corresponds to ""wif"".
  
- Example 2: ""wif lug zup bluf"" -> ""red blue yellow yellow""
  Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the last ""yellow"".
  
- Example 3: ""dax wif bluf"" -> ""green red red""
  Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red"".
  
- Example 4: ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
  Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red"".
  
- Example 5: ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" -> ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue""
  Here, ""bluf"" occurs twice and each time it corresponds to ""green"" following ""dax"" and then ""red"".

Given this consistent correspondence, the rule seems to be as follows:

Rule: bluf translates to the color ""red"".

Therefore,

bluf -> red.",1.0,185,bluf
"Based on the examples given, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" is being translated to the color ""red"". Every time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" follows in the output at the same position. Thus, we can infer the following rule:

bluf -> red",1.0,185,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can look at the outputs associated with each input and identify patterns.

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax wif,"" the output is ""yellow red red.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red.""
- When ""bluf"" stands alone after ""zup dax"" or ""lug zup,"" the output is still ""green red"" or ""blue yellow,"" respectively.

By comparing these, we can notice that:

- ""dax"" leads to ""green.""
- ""wif"" leads to ""red.""
- ""zup"" leads to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" leads to ""blue.""

The pattern suggests that ""bluf"" leads to the repetition of the previous color. For instance:

- ""dax wif zup bluf"" translates to ""green red yellow yellow,"" so ""bluf"" repeats the yellow from ""zup.""
- ""wif lug zup bluf"" translates to ""red blue yellow yellow,"" so ""bluf"" repeats the yellow from ""zup.""
- ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red,"" so ""bluf"" repeats the red from ""wif.""
- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" so ""bluf"" repeats the red from ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" causes a repetition of the previous color stated.

Rule: bluf -> repetition of the previous color.",1.0,185,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare each input containing the term with its respective output:

1. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
2. Input: wif lug zup bluf -> Output: red blue yellow yellow
3. Input: dax wif bluf -> Output: green red red
4. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
5. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

From these examples, we can observe the color immediately following ""bluf"" in the output:

1. After ""bluf"": yellow red (red follows ""walm"" as seen in example 1)
2. After ""bluf"": yellow
3. After ""bluf"": red
4. After ""bluf"": red
5. After ""bluf"": red yellow (yellow follows ""zup"" and blue follows ""lug"")

Noticing the pattern, ""bluf"" appears to consistently yield a ""red"" in the output sequence immediately after it. Hence, if we consider ""bluf"" to correspond to the color ""red,"" it matches with all the given examples.

Rule: bluf -> red",1.0,185,bluf

2. Otherwise, ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" when it is preceded by ""dax.""

"Rule: 
walm -> repeat the previous color three times",1.0,185,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it can be determined that the word 'walm' affects the color sequence output that follows it. The rule seems to be that 'walm' repeats the last color mentioned before it until a new color word or the end of the sequence is reached. Let's examine the examples to outline the rule:

Example 1:
Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow
Explanation: 'dax' leads to 'green', 'walm' repeats 'green' twice, 'wif' changes the color to 'red', 'walm' repeats 'red' twice, and 'zup' changes the color to 'yellow'.

Example 2:
Input: dax zup walm wif
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
Explanation: 'dax' leads to 'green', 'zup' changes the color to 'yellow', 'walm' repeats 'yellow' twice, and 'wif' changes the color to 'red'.

Example 3:
Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
Explanation: 'zup' leads to 'yellow', and 'walm' repeats 'yellow' twice.

Example 4:
Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
Explanation: 'dax' leads to 'green', 'lug' changes the color to 'blue', 'walm' repeats 'blue' three times, 'zup' changes the color to 'yellow', and 'wif' changes the color to 'red'.

Example 5:
Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
Explanation: 'dax' leads to 'green', 'lug' changes the color to 'blue', and 'walm' repeats 'blue' three times.

Based on this pattern, the rule for 'walm' appears to be the following:

So, 'walm' seems to act as a continuation or repetition marker for the last color mentioned in the sequence.",1.0,185,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before it. Here is the analysis of each input and the respective output:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""wif,"" with ""dax"" leading to ""green"" and ""wif"" leading to ""red."" Thus, ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in repeated ""green,"" and ""walm"" after ""wif"" results in repeated ""red.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and indeed, ""walm"" results in repeated ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" again, and we see repeated ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and again ""walm"" results in repeated ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, we see the same pattern with ""lug"" followed by ""walm"" leading to repeated ""blue.""

From this analysis, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the color corresponding to the preceding word.

So, given a word that corresponds to a particular color, ""walm"" will repeat that color an unspecified number of times.",1.0,185,walm
"To induce the rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" we must first look for patterns and examine each use of ""walm"" in the provided examples. We need to look for consistency in the word that comes after ""walm"" and the colors that are represented in the outputs.

1. ""dax walm wif walm zup"" -> ""green green green red red red yellow"" 
2. ""dax zup walm wif"" -> ""green yellow yellow yellow red""
3. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
4. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" -> ""green blue blue blue yellow red""
5. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""

Looking at these examples, let's first identify the color associated with words not including ""walm"":

- ""dax"" consistently associates with ""green.""
- ""zup"" consistently associates with ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" consistently associates with ""blue.""
- ""wif"" consistently associates with ""red.""

Now let's analyze the use of ""walm"":

1. The first instance of ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and is also associated with ""green,"" like ""dax.""
2. The second instance of ""walm"" in the same input follows ""wif"" and switches to the color associated with ""wif,"" which is ""red.""
3. Whenever ""walm"" is immediately followed by a word that has not been color-coded yet (like ""zup"" which is codable but has not been coded yet in the second input), or there is no word following ""walm"" (like in the fifth input), ""walm"" repeats the last known color.

This suggests that ""walm"" takes on the color value of the preceding word or repeats the last color if it has already been coded. If ""walm"" is the last word or is followed by an uncoded word, it repeats the previously established color sequence.

This is based on the fact that each occurrence consistently maps to the color(s) mentioned. The word ""dax"" always results in a single ""green,"" regardless of its position or the presence of other words. This consistency allows us to induce the meaning of ""dax"" as ""green"" in this particular context.

Rule: Each nonce word maps to a specific color or sequence of colors. ""Dax"" always maps to ""green.""",0.9,186,dax
"Observing the given inputs and corresponding outputs, the rule appears to be:

- The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".
- Subsequent words after ""dax"" yield a number of ""green"" outputs corresponding to their position in the sequence (with ""dax"" being the first position). For example, ""walm"" in the second position following ""dax"" produces ""green green green"".
- ""wif"" results in ""red"".

Here is the rule based on the above observations:

- dax -> green
- dax followed by another word -> the number of 'green's corresponding to the position of the word in the sequence
- wif -> red

Therefore, the rule deduced is:

Rule: The word ""dax"" outputs ""green"", and when ""dax"" is followed by additional words, each word produces a ""green"" output repeated according to the word's position in the sequence post-""dax"". When ""wif"" appears, it always translates to ""red"".",0.9,186,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can induce the following pattern:

- When “dax” is mentioned after another word, it outputs ""green"" followed by the color corresponding to the previous word.
- When “dax” is mentioned before a word, it outputs ""green"", thus not reflecting the next word's color.
- ""wif"" translates to red, as seen from the first input and the part of the fourth input.
- ""walm"" translates to green, considering every time ""walm"" appears, a series of ""green"" follows in the output.
- ""bluf"" translates to red since it follows ""wif"" in the last example and generates the same color in output.

A refined rule that might capture this is:
1. ""dax"" by itself translates to ""green"".
2. ""dax"" when used before another word that has an associated color (""wif"" with red, ""walm"" with green, ""bluf"" with red) still translates to ""green"" without indicating the color of the word it precedes.
3. ""dax"" when used after another word translates to ""green"" plus the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: dax -> green. When preceded by a color-associated word, output is ""green"" followed by the color of the preceding word.",0.8,186,dax
"Based on the examples given, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Each instance of ""wif"" in the input directly corresponds to an ""red"" in the output, regardless of the context or the words around it.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,186,wif
"Based on the provided examples, wif seems to translate to red. When looking at each output in sequence with each input, wif consistently corresponds to the color red, regardless of the surrounding words. Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red",1.0,186,wif
"Observing the patterns of the examples given, it seems the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Other words in the inputs, such as ""zup,"" ""dax,"" ""lug,"" and ""bluf,"" translate to ""yellow,"" ""green,"" ""blue,"" and ""red,"" respectively.

Given how the position of ""wif"" doesn't alter its output and it's not dependent on the presence of other words, it likely has a standalone meaning. Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following rule for ""wif"":

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,186,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the word ""red."" In every instance where ""wif"" is used, the output includes the color ""red."" No other input word consistently results in the color ""red"" appearing in the output. Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" corresponds specifically to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,186,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" appears in the same position in the output sequence. Therefore, the rule seems to be simple and consistent regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the sequence: 

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,186,wif
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" represents the color yellow regardless of its position in the sequence.",1.0,186,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in all given examples.",1.0,186,zup
"zup -> yellow

"zup -> meaning: yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Regardless of its position in a sequence, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""",1.0,186,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"", irrespective of its position in the sequence of words.",1.0,186,zup
"bluf -> blue. 

Rule: Each nonce word corresponds to a color name. ""Bluf"" corresponds to the color blue.",1.0,186,bluf
Rule: bluf -> blue,1.0,186,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> blue

The nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue in all given examples.",1.0,186,bluf
Rule: bluf -> blue,1.0,186,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer that:

1. Each instance of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
2. Each instance of ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
3. Each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
4. Each instance of ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Therefore, comparing the inputs and outputs where ""bluf"" appears, it consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in each case it precedes another color and to ""blue"" if it follows a color word or is at the beginning of a sequence. 

There is an exception, however: in the example ""wif bluf lug zup,"" it corresponds to ""red"" even though it is following ""wif."" This inconsistency suggests that ""bluf"" does not simply flip between ""red"" and ""blue"" based on its position relative to other colors. Instead, ""bluf"" should be interpreted as ""red"" when following ""wif.""

In summary, the rule seems to be:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it is ""red.""
- In all other contexts, ""bluf"" is ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> ""red"" when following ""wif"", ""blue"" otherwise.",0.9,186,bluf
"To figure out the rule behind the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the inputs and outputs and try to find the pattern that connects them.

Analyzing the first example:
Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green

Here, ""lug"" is followed by ""blue"" twice, and ""walm"" is followed by another ""blue."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Looking at the second example:
Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

""Zup"" is followed by ""yellow"" ""bluf"" does not seem to correspond to any color in the output, as it changes position but there isn't a new color in the output patterns. ""Lug"" is consistently followed by ""blue,"" and ""walm"" here is followed by ""yellow,"" which is the same color that precedes it.

In the third example:
Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

Again, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" is followed by ""blue,"" which is the same color as the one that precedes it.

In the fourth example:
Input: dax zup walm wif
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" again is followed by ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

In the fifth example:
Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" ""Walm"" is followed by ""yellow"" right after another ""yellow.""

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" is followed by the color that immediately precedes it. The rule for ""walm"" would be that it repeats the color word that directly precedes it in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color word that is directly before walm in the sequence.",1.0,186,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following patterns:

1. ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue"".
2. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" when it follows ""walm"", but not always when it appears by itself (see second and fifth examples).
3. ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow"".
4. ""wif"" appears to correspond to the output ""red"" when it is at the end of a sequence.
5. ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the second and fourth examples where it does not follow ""lug"" and ""walm.""

From the examples containing ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""walm"" precedes ""dax"" and the sequence ""walm dax"" results in the output ""blue green,"" indicating that ""walm"" might represent ""blue"" in this context, altering the color associated with ""dax.""

- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the next color after ""walm"" is ""yellow"" (repeating the color of ""zup""). It suggests that ""walm"" might cause a repetition or continuation of the prior color.

- The third example again shows ""lug walm wif"" yielding ""blue blue red."" Since ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and we know ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""walm"" could be duplicating the previous color ""blue.""

- The fourth example has ""walm"" following ""zup"" (""yellow"") and the next color is ""yellow"" again, consistent with the possibility of ""walm"" causing a continuation or repetition of the prior color.

- The fifth example has ""zup walm"" followed by ""dax""; it does not result in a continuation of ""yellow,"" but in the switch to ""green."" It suggests that ""walm"" may have a contextual influence that doesn't apply to the sequence ""zup dax.""

From these observations, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule:
walm -> causes a repetition of the prior color's output unless directly followed by ""dax,"" in which case the output becomes ""green."" 

If we strictly follow the examples, we might also include that ""walm"" has no effect on the output when it is the first word in the input. However, there could be an implicit assumption since ""walm"" never appears as the first word. Hence our rule might be slightly speculative, but it's the best induction from the examples given.",0.8,186,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that each word corresponds to a specific color, with 'walm' consistently outputting a series of 'yellow's. Each word in the input leads to a particular color in the output:

- 'lug' corresponds to a single 'blue'
- 'dax' corresponds to a single 'green'
- 'wif' corresponds to a single 'red'
- 'bluf' seems to correspond to a single 'blue' as well

The 'walm' word, however, appears to be a repetition signal, causing the following word's corresponding color to be repeated in the output the same number of times as 'walm' appears in the input before the next word.

Here's the breakdown:

1. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   - 'lug' outputs one blue, and 'walm' causes the next word 'dax' to repeat its color, which is green, two times. But since we see only one green at the end, the rule for 'walm' is overridden by the presence of another non-'walm' word.

2. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - 'zup' outputs one yellow, 'bluf' outputs blue, 'lug' outputs one blue, followed by another 'zup' which outputs one yellow. Then 'walm' repeats the output of 'zup' (yellow) two times.

3. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   - 'lug' outputs one blue, 'walm' repeats the next color which is 'wif' corresponding to red. It's repeated twice.

4. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   - 'dax' outputs green, 'zup' outputs yellow, 'walm' triple repeats the next color, which is red for 'wif' (but overlapped by the following word).

5. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
   - 'zup' outputs yellow, 'walm' would repeat the next color, 'dax', two additional times, but as 'zup' is repeated after the first 'dax', the rule is overridden, resulting in green only once followed by another 'zup'.

The rule for 'walm' seems to be that it causes the color corresponding to the word immediately following it to repeat, potentially up to the number of times 'walm' is repeated before another non-'walm' word. However, if another non-'walm' word precedes the expected repeated colors, the repetition pattern is broken.

Rule: walm -> triggers the repetition of the next word's corresponding color in the output. The number of repetitions equals the number of consecutive 'walm' words, up to the point another word appears that is not 'walm'.",0.8,186,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", we can look for patterns in the provided examples, specifically examining the position of ""walm"" and the color that follows it in the output.

1. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green

In this example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (which translates to ""blue"") and precedes ""dax"" (which translates to ""green""). The word right after ""walm"" is ""green"".

2. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Here, ""walm"" follows a series of ""yellow"" translations for ""zup"" and precedes another ""yellow"" translation, indicating its potential relationship to the color ""yellow"".

3. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

In this example, ""walm"" follows ""blue"" and precedes ""red"" translated from ""wif"".

4. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

In this case, ""walm"" is between ""yellow"" and ""red"".

5. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

Once again, ""walm"" is located between ""yellow"" and ""green"".

From these observations, we can deduce a pattern:

- When ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"", the translation is ""green"".
- When ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"", the translation is ""red"".
- When ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"", the translation is ""yellow"".

It is important to note that there is no example directly showing what the output would be if ""walm"" preceded ""lug"" or appeared at the end of the input. However, we can see that ""lug"" always translates to ""blue"", and thus it is possible that if ""walm"" were directly before ""lug"", the output might be ""blue"", but without an example, this remains speculative.

Based on what we do have, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word following it in the sequence:

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the following word in the sequence.",0.8,186,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the occurrences of the word and their corresponding outputs:

1. ""lug walm dax"" results in ""blue blue blue green""
    - Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

2. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
    - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""bluf"" is not followed by an output, and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

3. ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue blue red blue blue""
    - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

4. ""dax zup walm wif"" results in ""green yellow yellow yellow red""
    - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

5. ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red""
    - ""zup"" corresponds again to ""yellow"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""wif"" to ""red"".

It appears that the word ""walm"" does not have a fixed corresponding output color. Instead, the output color after ""walm"" is influenced by the word that follows ""walm"". Specifically, ""walm"" seems to repeat the output of the color that corresponds to the next word. Here's the pattern:

- ""walm dax"" results in ""blue green"" - the color of 'dax' is ""green"", and the output repeats ""blue"", which is the color associated with the preceding word ""lug"".
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow"" - the color after ""walm"" (which is not immediately displayed because there is no word following ""walm"" in this case) is ""yellow"", which is the color associated with ""zup"".

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the sequence, it results in the output color corresponding to the previous word and indicates that the next word's corresponding color should be repeated.

Hence, walm -> meaning: Repeat the output color of the following word.

(This pattern assumes that there is a word following ""walm,"" as the last example does not provide the repeated color due to lack of subsequent context.)",0.8,186,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" All inputs containing the word ""lug"" result in an output that includes the color blue at the corresponding position of ""lug.""

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,187,lug

"Rule: lug -> blue

"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that ""lug"" correlates with the word ""blue"".

- In example 1, ""lug dax bluf"" turns into ""blue green green"". The word ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue"".
- In example 2, ""lug bluf zup"" turns into ""blue blue yellow"". Again, ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue"".
- In example 3, ""zup lug walm"" turns into ""yellow blue blue blue"". In this context, ""lug"" follows ""zup"" which is ""yellow"", and ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue"" once more.
- In example 4, ""lug dax wif lug"" results in ""blue green red blue"". Both instances of ""lug"" correspond with ""blue"".
- Finally, in example 5, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"". Here ""lug"" is directly followed by ""bluf"" and corresponds with ""blue"" again.

Given these examples, the rule for the nonce word ""lug"" seems consistent across all instances regardless of context or position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule can be stated simply as:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,187,lug
Rule: lug -> blue.,1.0,187,lug

"Given the examples, we can infer the rules for translating each non-nonce word to a color. Let's look at the association between the non-nonce words and the colors they represent:

- zup -> yellow

"Given the examples provided, it appears that the word 'bluf' correlates with the color 'red' being repeated twice. 

For each occurrence:
- When 'bluf' is mentioned, the output consistently includes 'red red'.
- When 'bluf' is not mentioned, the sequence 'red red' does not appear.

Thus, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> 'red red'",1.0,187,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" we can examine the patterns in the given input-output pairs. For each example, we will pair each nonce word in the input with the color word in the output:

1. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow
   Pairing: wif -> red, bluf -> red, lug -> blue, zup -> yellow

2. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   Pairing: zup -> yellow, walm -> yellow, lug -> blue, wif -> red, bluf -> red

3. Input: zup wif bluf

   Pairing: zup -> yellow, wif -> red, bluf -> red

4. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   Pairing: dax -> green, zup -> yellow, bluf -> yellow

5. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green
   Pairing: wif -> red, bluf -> red, dax -> green

Across all examples, we observe that the word ""bluf"" is associated with different color outputs in different contexts:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" ""bluf"" is not present, but in the other examples, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Given these associations, it seems that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it. When it follows ""wif,"" it is red because ""wif"" is red. When it follows ""zup,"" it is yellow because ""zup"" is yellow. When it follows ""dax,"" there's no example directly showing the output for ""bluf,"" but if we follow the pattern, it should be green because ""dax"" is green.

Rule: bluf -> red

"Bluf -> yellow

Rule: Each occurrence of the nonce word ""bluf"" correlates with the color yellow in the output.",0.0,187,bluf
"To discern the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let us identify its position and the corresponding output in each example:

1. lug wif dax **walm** zup     -> blue red green **green** green yellow
2. zup dax **walm** zup wif -> yellow green **green** green yellow red

5. dax **walm** zup                  -> green **green** green yellow

From the provided examples, we can observe that the word following ""walm"" is always repeated three times in the output, and they are colored with the same color. Thus, we can induce the following rule for walm:

Rule: walm causes the next word's color to be repeated three times in sequence.

So, ""walm"" -> meaning: a repeater for the next word's corresponding color, outputted three times.",1.0,187,walm
"Based on the provided examples, walm appears to directly influence the color that follows it. When 'walm' appears in the input, the same color is repeated multiple times in the output, until a new color word is encountered in the input. Notably, 'walm' itself directly corresponds to a color repeat of the color word that comes before it. Thus, 'walm' seems to mean 'repeat the previous color'.

Here's the breakdown of the rule:

- In the first example, 'dax walm' translates to 'green green' and then continues to repeat 'green' until 'zup' changes the color to 'yellow'.

- In the second example, 'dax walm' again leads to 'green green', with the repetition of 'green' until 'zup' and 'wif' change the color.

- Similarly, in the third example, 'lug zup walm lug' results in the 'yellow' from 'zup' being repeated due to 'walm' until it switches back to 'blue' with the final 'lug'.

- The fourth example follows the same pattern with 'wif walm' causing the 'red' to be repeated.

- Lastly, the fifth example shows 'dax walm zup' producing repetition of 'green' from 'dax' before changing to 'yellow' with 'zup'.

Rule: walm -> causes the previous color to be repeated until a new color word appears in the sequence.",1.0,187,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" means ""repeat the color associated with the previous nonce word"". 

This is inferred from the repetition of the color word that follows each occurrence of ""walm"" and is directly related to the previous color mentioned before ""walm"". For example, in the first input, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" we see ""green"" repeated.",1.0,187,walm
"Reviewing the given examples:

1. lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow
2. zup dax walm zup wif -> yellow green green green yellow red
3. lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue
4. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
5. dax walm zup -> green green green yellow

One consistent pattern is that ""walm"" directly affects the color mentioned before it, with the following instances of that color being replicated until a new color word is introduced (or the sequence ends):

- In the first example, after ""walm"" the color green is repeated twice and then switched to yellow after ""zup"".
- In the second example, green is repeated two more times after ""walm"" until ""wif"", which changes the color to red.
- In the third example, after ""walm"" the yellow is repeated once and then switches back to blue after ""lug"".
- In the fourth example, red is repeated twice after ""walm"" with no more colors following to change the sequence.
- In the fifth example, green is repeated after ""walm"" until yellow is introduced by ""zup"".

Based on these examples, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the next color to repeat until a different color word or the sequence ends.

Rule: walm -> Causes the next color to repeat until a different color word appears or the sequence ends.",1.0,187,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns before and after it appears in each example.

1. In the first example, ""dax walm zup"" translates to ""green green green yellow."" Since ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""walm"" must represent a transition from ""green"" to ""green"" again.

2. In the second example, ""dax walm zup"" appears again with ""green green green yellow,"" which is consistent with the above.

3. In the third example, ""lug walm lug"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow blue."" ""Walm"" is between two ""lug"" which are ""blue,"" but this time ""walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow.""

4. In the fourth example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"" which means ""walm"" represents a transition from ""red"" to ""red.""

5. In the fifth example, ""dax walm zup"" translates to ""green green green yellow,"" which is consistent with examples one and two.

From these examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color before it, except for the last color which is yellow, likely due to the presence of ""zup"" which translates to yellow.

Rule: walm -> Means to repeat the color preceding it in the sequence, up to the last color which switches to yellow if followed by ""zup"".",0.8,187,walm

lug -> blue,1.0,188,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine the pattern of words and their corresponding colors.

1. Pairing each ""dax"" with its output, it seems that every instance of ""dax"" is matched with the color green. Additionally, the word ""dax"" is never associated with any color other than green, regardless of the position in the sequence or the words that come before or after it.

2. Checking against the other words and outputs:

- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red.
- ""zup"" always corresponds to yellow.
- ""lug"" is matched with blue once, and there are no instances to suggest otherwise.
- ""walm"" is associated with green when it appears, but not specifically attributed to ""dax.""

With these observations, the rule seems to be that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position or surrounding context.

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,188,dax
"Rule: dax -> green

Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green."" Regardless of the position or the context in which ""dax"" appears, it consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""",1.0,188,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze each pair of input and output sequences.

- Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output.
- The word ""dax"" does not seem to affect the words before or after it.
- The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output word ""green,"" regardless of position in the sentence.

Based on these observations, we can infer the following rule:

dax -> green

So, the meaning of ""dax"" within the context of these examples is simply the color ""green.""",1.0,188,dax
"Based on the examples provided:

- In the first example, ""wif dax zup dax"" translates to ""red green yellow green."" Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" both times it appears.
- In the second example, ""lug dax"" translates to ""blue green."" Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- In the third example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""walm"" also translates to ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax zup dax zup wif"" translates to ""green yellow green yellow red."" Once more, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" translates to ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" again.

From the provided examples, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green,"" regardless of the position in the sequence or the surrounding words.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,188,dax
"The examples suggest that dax corresponds to the color green. Each time the word dax appears in the input, the word green appears in the output. The other words in the inputs correspond to different colors: 'wif' to red, 'zup' to yellow, 'lug' to blue, and 'walm' to the color green repeated for each letter in 'walm'. It's notable that 'walm' leads to multiple greens in the output, indicating a repeated pattern for each letter, while 'dax' always represents a single instance of green, regardless of context.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,188,dax
"Rule: wif -> red

Based on the given examples, whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the output consistently includes ""red."" Therefore, wif translates to red regardless of its position or the context within the string of words.",1.0,188,wif
Rule: wif -> red,1.0,188,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. The other words (""zup,"" ""dax,"" ""walm,"" ""lug"") correspond to different colors (""yellow,"" ""green,"" ""blue,"" respectively). It does not appear that the position of ""wif"" within the input sequence affects its correspondence with the color red, nor does it seem to affect the colors associated with the other words.

Thus, the rule appears straightforward:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,188,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following rules:

1. When ""wif"" appears in the input without any other context, it outputs ""red.""
2. When ""wif"" appears with other words, it still outputs ""red,"" and each of the other words has a corresponding color output.

We can observe the color outputs for the other words when ""wif"" is not present to figure out their individual meanings:

- ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds with ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue""
- ""walm"" appears to extend the color of the word before it, indicated by repeated greens and blues after ""dax"" and ""lug"" respectively.

Given this information and the examples, we can conclude that the word ""wif"" has the following meaning or rule:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,188,wif
"Rule: wif -> red

Based on the examples given, whenever the nonce word ""wif"" appears in the input, the output always contains ""red"" corresponding to its position. The other words in the inputs (""zup,"" ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""walm"") correspond to their own colors consistently across the examples, which are not asked to be deduced in the current problem. Thus, the rule for ""wif"" can be clearly identified as outputting the color ""red.""",1.0,188,wif

"zup -> meaning: yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,188,zup
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" indicates repeating the colors of the words that preceded it in the sequence, in reverse order. To be precise, for each word that represents a color, ""bluf"" causes that color to be output twice and in the reverse sequence of their appearance. 

Let's analyze the examples to define the rule:

- In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""wif"" corresponds to red. After ""bluf,"" the output is blue red red, which confirms that ""bluf"" repeated the preceding colors in reverse order.
- In the second example, ""wif"" and ""lug"" correspond to red and blue respectively. After ""bluf,"" the output shows ""blue blue red red red"", repeating both red and blue in reverse order.
- In the third example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""wif"" to red, and ""zup"" to yellow. After ""bluf,"" the output is ""green red green yellow yellow,"" once again confirming that the colors are repeated in reverse order.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows after ""wif"" and ""dax,"" which correspond to red and green. The output after ""bluf"" includes red and green repeated twice, as observed from previous patterns.
- The fifth example further confirms the rule, as ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""dax"" correspond to blue, red, and green. After ""bluf,"" the sequence of these colors is repeated in reverse, resulting in ""blue red green green red blue.""

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" can be formulated as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Repeat the sequence of the colors represented by the nonce words preceding ""bluf"" in reverse order, each color repeated twice.",1.0,188,bluf
"From the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" is associated with repeating the color word that directly precedes it one additional time.

Examples:

- ""lug wif bluf"" -> ""blue red red"" (repeating ""red"")
- ""wif walm lug bluf"" -> ""red red red blue blue"" (repeating ""blue"")
- ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" -> ""green red green yellow yellow"" (repeating ""yellow"")
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green"" (repeating ""red"")
- ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" -> ""blue red green green red blue"" (repeating ""green"")

Rule: bluf -> repeating the color of the word immediately before it.",1.0,188,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look at the patterns associated with its usage and the resulting outputs. One clear pattern is that ""bluf"" always results in colors being repeated. Let's analyze the patterns in detail:

- In the first example, ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" might cause the color before it to be repeated.

- In the second example, ""wif walm lug bluf"" translates to ""red red red blue blue,"" following the same pattern where ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the preceding colors, in this case, ""red"" from ""wif"" and ""blue"" from ""lug.""

- In the third example, ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green red green yellow yellow,"" where ""bluf"" causes the repetition of ""green"" from ""dax"" and ""yellow"" from ""zup.""

- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green,"" confirming that ""bluf"" repeats the color from both the prior and the following words (""red"" from ""wif"" and ""green"" from ""dax"").

- In the fifth example, ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" translates to ""blue red green green red blue,"" and here ""bluf"" seems to repeat the preceding colors ""green"" from ""dax"" and ""red"" from ""wif.""

From these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the color denoted by the word immediately preceding it, and potentially also causes the repetition of the subsequent color word after ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> causes the repetition of the color denoted by the preceding word, and may also repeat the subsequent color if it appears after ""bluf.""",0.8,188,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the relationship between the inputs and their corresponding outputs, considering the position and frequency of the words and their translated colors.

In the first input, ""bluf"" corresponds to a single color, ""blue."" However, in other inputs, ""bluf"" corresponds to two colors. To reconcile this, let's consider that ""bluf"" may not simply correspond to a fixed color, but instead to the repetition of a color or pattern.

In the second example, ""bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" which is the color ""blue"" repeated twice.

Analyzing further:

- In the third example, ""bluf"" becomes ""yellow yellow,"" which is the color before ""bluf"" repeated twice.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is not present, but based on the previous patterns, it could have meant ""green green"" if it had followed ""dax.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" appears after ""dax"" translating to ""green green,"" confirming the repetition pattern.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" dictates the repetition of the color corresponding to the word before it, and the repetition is twice the number of occurrences of ""bluf.""

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:
Rule: ""bluf"" means repeat the color corresponding to the previous word two times for each occurrence of ""bluf.""

Writing the answer as instructed:
bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word two times for each occurrence of ""bluf.""",0.8,188,bluf
"Based on the examples given, each word appears to correspond to a specific color:

- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""walm"" -> green
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""bluf"" -> blue

The rule seems to be that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue, but it can be repeated based on certain conditions which are likely related to the words that come before it.

To identify the pattern for ""bluf"", let's look closer at its occurrences:

1. In Example 1 (""lug wif bluf""), ""bluf"" was said once and the output was ""blue"" once.
2. In Example 2 (""wif walm lug bluf""), ""bluf"" was said once but the output was ""blue"" twice.
3. In Example 3 (""dax wif dax zup bluf""), ""bluf"" was said once and the output was ""yellow"" twice.
4. In Example 4 (""wif bluf dax walm""), ""bluf"" was said once and there is no ""blue"" in the output, the following words are ""green"" twice.
5. In Example 5 (""lug wif dax bluf wif lug""), ""bluf"" was said once but the output was ""green"" twice followed by ""red blue"".

The appearances of colors following ""bluf"" indicate that ""bluf"" might cause the next color word to be repeated once, although there might be exceptions or additional conditions, as indicated by Example 4, where ""green"" is repeated without a ""blue"" preceding it. However, Example 4 could also be seen as ""bluf"" suppressing the output of ""blue"" and doubling the following color ""green"". This interpretation is less consistent with the other examples, so it's less likely to be correct.

Considering these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it corresponds to the color blue, and also causes the next color word to be repeated once. However, because of the inconsistent outcome in Example 4, the pattern is not completely clear, and there may be additional context-dependent rules.

Using the most consistent pattern from the examples provided, here's the deduced rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> blue and causes the next color word to repeat once, except when the next word is ""dax"" after which ""bluf"" does not appear as ""blue"" and the ""dax"" transforms to ""green green"". 

Since we don't have enough data to confirm the interaction with ""dax"" and its possible exception to the rule, further examples would be required to validate this exception or to clarify the conditions under which ""bluf"" changes its behavior.",0.7,188,bluf
"walm -> repeats the color associated with the previous word the number of times the word ""walm"" has been used sequentially. Rule:

- The first use of ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word once (see ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue"").
- The second sequential use of ""walm"" repeats the color twice (see ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue"").
- The third sequential use of ""walm"" repeats the color three times (see ""dax walm lug"" -> ""green green green blue"").
- The fourth use that is not sequential does not repeat because there is a word (lug) interrupting the sequence but again starts a new sequence (see ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"").
- In the last example, each time ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it repeats ""red"" three times because it's the third use in its sequence, separated by ""zup lug,"" which produce their own colors.",1.0,188,walm
"Rule: The word walm is associated with the repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it.

Here's the explanation based on the examples given:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" which means that the word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and walm causes it to repeat three times.
- ""dax lug walm"" leads to ""green blue blue blue,"" where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and again, walm causes ""lug"" to repeat three times.
- ""dax walm lug"" produces ""green green green blue,"" meaning that walm made the ""dax"" (green) repeat three times before the ""lug"" which is just said once.
- ""dax walm"" creates ""green green green,"" meaning walm made the ""dax"" (green) repeat three times.
- ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" results in ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow,"" so walm caused ""wif"" (red) to repeat three times before moving on to the next color words, ""zup"" and ""lug.""

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: walm causes the color associated with the word before it to be repeated three times.",1.0,188,walm
"walm -> repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it the same number of times as there are letters in that preceding word. Rule: If the word immediately before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" output ""blue"" repeated three times because ""lug"" has three letters.

If the word before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" output ""red"" repeated three times because ""wif"" has three letters.",1.0,188,walm
"walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" changes dependent on the context, specifically the word that comes before it. 

Rule: If ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" then ""walm"" generates a series of ""blue."" If ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" then ""walm"" generates a series of ""green."" If no word precedes walm (or the word is not recognized as having a rule associated with it, such as ""wif"" in the given examples), ""walm"" generates a series of ""red."" If ""zup"" follows ""walm,"" a ""yellow"" is inserted between the series of colors generated by ""walm"" and the series generated by the word following ""zup"".",1.0,188,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color represented by the word immediately preceding it. Here's a breakdown of each example:

1. ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"" — here, ""walm"" leads to the word ""blue"" being repeated three times.
2. ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue"" — ""walm"" results in the repetition of ""blue"" three times after ""lug"".
3. ""dax walm lug"" translates to ""green green green blue"" — ""walm"" results in the repetition of ""green"" three times after ""dax"" before ""lug"" is translated to ""blue"".
4. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"" — without any word following ""walm"", the color represented by ""dax"" (green) is repeated three times.
5. ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" translates to ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow"" — ""walm"" results in ""red"" being repeated three times after ""wif"", before and after ""lug"" is translated to ""blue"", and finally ""zup"" as ""yellow"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
- ""walm"" -> Leads to the repetition of the previously mentioned color three times before a new color word is introduced or the sequence ends.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color word, that color word is outputted three times. If ""walm"" precedes a color word, the color that ""walm"" represents (from the last mentioned color word) is repeated three times before the new color word is represented once.

Analysis:
- Each instance of ""walm"" in the inputs corresponds to a sequence of ""blue"" in the outputs.
- The number of ""blue"" in each sequence following ""walm"" appears to match the number of words preceding ""walm"" in the input.

4. wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue
5. lug walm -> blue blue blue

In every instance, the appearance of ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color that precedes its first occurrence in the output. That is, after ""walm"" is mentioned, the output color is repeated multiple times, directly following the color associated with the word preceding ""walm."" For example:

- In the first case, ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue,"" and after ""walm"" is mentioned, ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- In the second case, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" ""yellow"" appears three times before the pattern is interrupted by ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red.""
- In all other cases, the pattern holds, with ""walm"" initiating a repetition of the preceding color in the output sequence.

Based on the evidence from the examples, we can induce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the color associated with that word is repeated multiple times in the output immediately after the occurrence of ""walm.""

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" can be deduced as:

walm -> Initiates a repetition of the color associated with the previous word.",1.0,189,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the examples provided. Looking at the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can notice the following:

- When ""wif"" appears, it corresponds to the color ""red.""
- When ""lug"" appears, it corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- When ""zup"" appears, it corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- When ""dax"" and ""bluf"" appear, they correspond to ""green"" and ""blue,"" respectively, but these words do not seem to affect the output for ""walm.""

Now, examining where ""walm"" appears and what follows in the output:

1. ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue""; ""walm"" corresponds to repeated ""blue.""
2. ""dax zup walm wif"" -> ""green yellow yellow yellow red""; ""walm"" corresponds to repeated ""yellow.""
3. ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" -> ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""; each ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color that follows its first occurrence's corresponding word color.
4. ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue""; ""walm"" corresponds to repeated ""blue.""
5. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""; ""walm"" corresponds to repeated ""blue.""

From these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" results in repeating the color of the word that follows it. When ""walm"" is the last word, it repeats the color that corresponds to the last word preceding it. If ""walm"" is followed by another ""walm,"" it seems to repeat the color corresponding to the last non-""walm"" word.

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the color that corresponds to the following word (or the last color mentioned if at the end or followed by another ""walm"").",0.9,189,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we examine the outputs corresponding to each example where ""walm"" is used.

- In every instance where ""walm"" appears, a sequence of ""blue"" is outputted.
- The number of ""blue"" in the sequence corresponds to the position of ""walm"" in the input plus one (i.e., if ""walm"" is the first word, there is one ""blue"", if ""walm"" is the second word, there are two ""blue"", and so on).

Let's examine each case:

1. Input: wif lug walm -> Output: red blue blue blue
   - ""Walm"" is the third word, output is three ""blue"".

2. Input: dax zup walm wif -> Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   - ""Walm"" is the third word, output is three ""yellow"".
   - This case breaks the initial hypothesis, as the color should be ""blue"" according to the initial rule. To resolve this discrepancy, we can refine the rule to account for the context given by the words before ""walm"". The color before ""walm"" is carried on for a count that matches the position of ""walm"". However, for consistency, we'll continue to explore more examples.

3. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm -> Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""Walm"" first appears as the second word, output is double ""red"".
   - ""Walm"" then appears as the sixth word, yielding four ""yellow"".
   - This supports the refined rule that the color output for ""walm"" is influenced by the preceding word.

4. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm -> Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   - ""Walm"" is the fifth word, output is four ""blue"".
   - This aligns with the initial observation that ""walm"" outputs ""blue"" in a sequence that corresponds to its position.

5. Input: lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue
   - ""Walm"" is the second word, output is two ""blue"".
   - This supports the initial hypothesis.

The discrepancy in the second example suggests that our initial hypothesis was incorrect, and the refined rule needs further adjustment. After examining all examples, the refined rule is:

`""Walm"" results in a sequence of colors that matches the color of the word immediately preceding it, and the count of colors corresponds to the positional count of ""walm"" itself.`

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word as many times as the position of ""walm"" in the input list.",0.8,189,walm

"To deduce the meaning of dax, we'll look at the examples given and the corresponding outputs to see if we can determine a pattern or rule.

- When the input is ""dax"" alone, the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""wif,"" the output is ""green red,"" suggesting ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" might correspond to ""red.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""lug,"" the output starts with ""green"" followed by a series of ""blue,"" indicating that ""lug"" might correspond to the color ""blue"" and possibly repeats colors.
- When ""dax"" precedes both ""lug"" and ""wif"" with ""walm"" at the end, the output is ""green blue red red red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" might correspond to repeating the previous color.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule for dax:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" when it appears in the input, regardless of its position or the presence of other words.",1.0,190,dax
"Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. However, we also have other words (""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""zup"") that correspond to different colors, some repeated a varying number of times (""wif"" -> ""red,"" ""lug"" -> ""blue,"" ""walm"" -> ""blue blue blue,"" ""zup"" -> ""yellow""), and the repetition seems to depend on their position following ""dax.""

From the given examples, the meanings of the words can be deduced as follows:
dax -> green
wif -> red
lug -> blue
walm -> blue blue blue (repeated three times irrespective of its position after ""dax"")
zup -> yellow

Let's verify this with the given examples:

Input 1: dax wif zup dax translates to green red yellow green (which matches the output).
Input 2: dax lug walm translates to green blue blue blue (since ""walm"" seems to repeat ""blue"" three times).
Input 3: dax lug wif walm translates to green blue red red red (with ""walm"" adding two more ""red"" following ""wif"").
Input 4: dax translates to just green.
Input 5: dax wif translates to green red.

Rule: ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and other nonce words after ""dax"" correspond to specific color names, sometimes repeated based on the rule associated with that specific word.",1.0,190,dax
"From the given examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" directly correlates to the color ""green"" in the output every time it is used. Here are the instances showing this correlation:

- ""dax wif zup dax"" corresponds to ""green red yellow green""
- ""dax lug walm"" corresponds to ""green blue blue blue""
- ""dax lug wif walm"" corresponds to ""green blue red red red""
- ""dax"" on its own corresponds to ""green""
- ""dax wif"" corresponds to ""green red""

It is important to note that ""dax"" is consistently translated to ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,190,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" translates to ""green."" When ""dax"" appears, the output is always ""green"" for that position, regardless of the context or the other words that follow. The other words and repetitions in the input seem to affect the color output after the initial occurrence of ""dax,"" but not the translation of ""dax"" itself.

Thus, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green.",1.0,190,dax
"Rule: dax translates to the color green. Each instance of dax corresponds to a single ""green"" in the outputs.

The meaning of other words like ""wif"" and ""lug"" influences the number of consecutive colors following them. For example:
""wif"" is followed by a single ""red"".
""lug"" is followed by three ""blue"".

So:
dax -> green
wif -> red
lug -> blue blue blue
walm -> no direct translation, but based on the pattern, it influences the number of consecutive colors (when following ""lug"" or ""wif"", it extends the sequence of the color mentioned before it).",1.0,190,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we have the following:

1. dax bluf wif zup dax → green green red yellow green
2. zup dax wif → yellow green red
3. wif → red
4. wif lug walm → red blue blue blue
5. wif bluf → red red

Analyzing the outputs, we can see that every time the word ""wif"" appears, the corresponding output is ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input or the context provided by the other words.

Therefore, the rule is as follows:

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. 

Writing this as you requested:

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to observe the common patterns and relationships in different examples.

Let's look at each input and its corresponding output.

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

2. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green

3. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue

4. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

5. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

Analyzing these patterns, we can deduce that:
- ""zup"" results in ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" results in ""green.""
- ""lug"" results in ""blue.""
- ""wif"" results in ""red.""
- ""walm"" results in ""blue"" or ""red"" depending on its position.

Now, let's focus on ""bluf"" specifically:
- Whenever ""bluf"" appears right after ""zup,"" the next colour is the same as ""zup"" (yellow).
- Whenever ""bluf"" appears right after ""dax,"" the next colour is the same as ""dax"" (green).

A pattern emerges where ""bluf"" seems to repeat the colour of the word preceding it. Let's verify this with the input-output pairs:
- In example 1, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (which corresponds to yellow) and the output is ""yellow"" repeated once.
- In example 2, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (which corresponds to green) and the output is ""green"" repeated once.
- In example 3, ""bluf"" again follows ""zup,"" resulting in an additional ""yellow"" in the output.
- In example 5, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" (which corresponds to red) and the output shows ""red"" repeated once more.

Thus, the rule appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.",1.0,190,bluf
"To determine the meaning of 'bluf,' we look for patterns in the given input-output pairs. We need to identify what is consistent every time ""bluf"" appears and how it maps to the output.

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green

Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

Looking at these examples, we can see that:
- When ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- When ""wif"" appears, the output begins with ""red.""
- When ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue.""
- When ""walm"" appears, it seems to affect the output by extending the length of the subsequent color, usually with ""blue"" or ""red.""

For the appearance of ""bluf,"" we notice that:
- ""zup bluf"" maps to ""yellow yellow.""
- ""dax bluf"" maps to ""green green.""

Thus, it seems that ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated once. For ""zup"" which maps to ""yellow,"" the appearance of ""bluf"" thus leads to an additional ""yellow."" Similarly, for ""dax"" which maps to ""green,"" the appearance of ""bluf"" duplicates the ""green.""

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color associated with the previous word.",1.0,190,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns in each example:

1. zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   ""zup"" is assigned the color yellow, ""wif"" and ""walm"" are assigned the color red.

2. dax bluf
   Output: green green
   ""dax"" is assigned the color green.

3. zup lug zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
   The pattern for ""zup"" is yellow, ""lug"" is blue, and the occurrence of ""bluf"" after ""zup"" results in an additional yellow.

4. zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   This repeats the pattern of the first example.

5. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   The pattern for ""dax"" is green, ""lug"" is blue, ""walm"" is blue, ""wif"" is red. ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"" leading to two reds following the sequence of ""dax wif"".

Based on these observations:

- When ""bluf"" appears after ""zup"" or ""dax"", it repeats the color assigned to these words.
- ""bluf"" does not have a direct color association but rather influences the repetition of the previously mentioned color.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" leads to the repetition of the color assigned to the word immediately before it.",1.0,190,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the patterns of the input and corresponding output colors:

1. In the first example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" results in ""yellow yellow red red red."" We notice that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red.""

2. In the second example, ""dax bluf"" gives us ""green green."" Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" which is consistent with input example 5.

3. The third example ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue."" From this, we discern ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Given the information above, we can see that the word after ""bluf"" in examples 1 and 4 repeats the color associated with the word right before ""bluf."" In example 5, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" and the output is ""red red green,"" where ""green"" refers to ""dax"" and ""red red"" is the repeated pattern, suggesting that ""bluf"" causes a repetition of the previous color, but with the occurrence of the color doubled, then continues with the sequence.

Therefore, based on the provided examples, we can conclude:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> The output corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" will be doubled before continuing the sequence.",0.8,190,bluf
"From the examples given, it seems that each word corresponds to a color. The word ""bluf"" always produces a sequence of ""yellow"" followed by one or more ""red"". Looking at the ""dax bluf"" input/output and the ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" input/output, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""bluf"" in the first example generates a sequence of two ""green"".

However, this is likely coincidental as ""dax"" appears in the input without a subsequent occurrence of ""green"" in the second example. In all instances, ""bluf"" itself leads to a ""yellow"" followed by at least one ""red"". The number of ""red"" following ""yellow"" doesn't seem to match with the position of ""bluf"" in the sentence or with the words around it consistently, so without additional information, the most reliable rule I can induce is:

**Rule:** bluf -> a sequence starting with ""yellow"" and followed by an undetermined number of ""red"".",0.8,190,bluf
"Analyzing the inputs and the corresponding outputs:

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax lug"", the output is a sequence of ""blue blue blue blue"", which indicates that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". The triple occurrence of the color ""blue"" following ""walm"" suggests that ""walm"" might represent a repetition of the color that precedes it.
  
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which we know represents ""blue"", the output is ""blue blue blue"", once again indicating that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the preceding color.
  
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup dax"", and ""zup"" results in ""yellow"", the output after ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow yellow"", again showing a repetition of the preceding color.
  
- When ""walm"" is preceded only by ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"", the output is ""red red red"", yet another case where ""walm"" causes the previous color to be repeated three times.

Based on these observations, we can deduce that the rule for ""walm"" is a triplication of the color word that precedes it.

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeats the color word immediately before it three times.",1.0,190,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to trigger a repetition of the color name that immediately precedes it. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""dax lug walm"", ""lug"" is associated with blue, and after ""walm"" is used, the output is ""blue blue blue blue"". ""Walm"" repeats the ""blue"" three times.
- In the second example, ""lug walm wif lug"", ""lug"" before ""walm"" is blue, and it is followed by three ""blue"" in the output. Then ""wif"" is red, and it is followed by ""lug"" which is blue, resulting in ""blue blue blue red blue"".
- In the third example, ""wif dax zup walm"", the colors before ""walm"" are red, green, and yellow respectively, and after ""walm"", the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"" which repeats the color of ""zup"".
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""wif walm"" simply result in ""red red red"", which repeats the color red associated with ""wif"" three times.

Rule: walm -> Triggers a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately before it, repeating that color three additional times.",1.0,190,walm
"To determine the meaning or rule behind ""walm,"" we can analyze the correspondence between the inputs and outputs in the examples provided:

- In the first example, ""dax lug walm,"" we have the output ""green blue blue blue."" The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and since ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in three instances of ""blue,"" it seems to represent a repetition of whatever color word preceded it.
  
- In the second example, ""lug walm wif lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue red blue."" It follows the same pattern where ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color corresponding to ""lug"" (blue) until another color word appears (""wif"" corresponding to red).

- In the third example, ""wif dax zup walm,"" the output is ""red green yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the color yellow is repeated hence, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of ""zup.""

- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""wif walm,"" the outputs are ""red red red"" in both cases. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it repeats ""red"" two extra times. 

From these observations, we can deduce that the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word.

With this rule, we can now predict the output of any input containing ""walm"" as long as we know the color association of the word that comes directly before it.",1.0,190,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the meaning of the word ""walm"" changes depending on its position or possibly depending on the word(s) before it. To understand the pattern, let's look at each example:

1. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - It seems that ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" Since ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the output is ""blue blue,"" ""walm"" could be associated with generating additional ""blue.""

2. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue
   - Here ""lug"" still translates to ""blue,"" and now ""walm"" seems to repeat the ""blue"" again before ""wif"" changes the pattern to ""red.""

3. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   - In this example, ""wif"" gives ""red,"" ""dax"" gives ""green,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" Since ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and outputs ""yellow yellow,"" ""walm"" seems to repeat the color given by the word before it.

4. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   - With ""wif"" giving ""red,"" the occurrence of ""walm"" results in two additional ""red"" outputs.

5. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   - This example is the same as the previous one, which reinforces the pattern from the previous example.

Rule: The meaning of ""walm"" appears to be repeating the color associated with the immediately preceding word.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning. ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color of the word before it.",0.9,190,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the given examples to see how the appearance of ""walm"" affects the output:

1. Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue
2. Input: lug walm wif lug -> Output: blue blue blue red blue
3. Input: wif dax zup walm -> Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
4. Input: wif walm -> Output: red red red
5. Input: wif walm -> Output: red red red

Now let's look for patterns:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue blue,"" with ""lug"" being translated to ""blue"" and ""walm"" seeming to create three additional ""blue"" instances.
- In the second example, ""walm"" is surrounded by ""lug"" which we've established translates to ""blue,"" but here ""wif"" produces a ""red,"" while ""walm"" seems to produce two additional ""blue"" before encountering ""wif.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" is at the end after ""zup,"" with ""wif"" being red, ""dax"" being green, and ""zup"" being yellow. After ""zup,"" ""walm"" produces two additional instances of ""yellow.""
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" and the output is three instances of ""red.""

From these patterns, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it three times. If the preceding word has not been established, it defaults to repeating the color of ""wif"" which is red.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word three times. If there is no established preceding color, default to repeating the color for ""wif,"" which is red.",0.8,190,walm

- lug -> blue
- walm -> green or red, depending on the word that precedes it (green if dax precedes walm, and red if wif precedes walm or it occurs at the end of the sequence)

Now let's examine the use of 'zup' across the examples. 

1. In the first example, 'zup' is followed by the output 'yellow' which is then followed by 'dax' which maps to 'green'. Hence, we don't have any particular dependency here.

"From the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the rule or meaning of ""zup"" based on the output:

1. When ""dax"" is present, the corresponding output is ""green"".
2. When ""walm"" is present, the output consists of sequential ""green"" responses.
3. When ""wif"" is present, the output is ""red"".
4. When ""bluf"" is present, the output is ""green"" or ""red"", depending on context.
5. When ""lug"" is present, the output is ""blue"".

Given these observations, let's look for a pattern for ""zup"":

- In the first example, ""zup"" appears between two ""dax"", and the output for it is ""yellow"".
- In the second example, ""zup"" follows ""lug"" and its corresponding output is ""yellow"".
- In the third example, ""zup"" appears both at the beginning and in the middle of a sequence, and in each case, its corresponding output is ""yellow"". It is followed by different words (""dax"" and ""lug""), suggesting its output isn't affected by the following word.
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" follows ""wif"" and the output is once again ""yellow"".
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" is the first word, and its output is ""yellow"".

Based on these observations, we can deduce that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"" regardless of the words that come before or after it. Therefore, the rule is as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow",1.0,191,zup
"With the given examples, we can analyze the pattern and meaning of the word ""zup"" based on its relation to other known words and their corresponding output colors.

1. When ""dax"" is mentioned, the output color is green.
2. When ""walm"" is mentioned, the output color is green.
3. When ""wif"" is mentioned, the output color is red.
4. When ""bluf"" is mentioned, the output color is green.
5. When ""lug"" is mentioned, the output color is blue.

However, there's an inconsistency with the rule for ""bluf,"" as in the first input, it translates to green, but in the fourth input, it translates to green again. Possibly, this indicates that there may be a mistake, or ""bluf"" may have a conditional color output based on surrounding words (though with the current examples provided, it is always followed by ""zup"" with no deviation). For now, let's count ""bluf"" as green until more information indicates otherwise.

Now let's look specifically at ""zup"":

- In the first example, ""zup"" is between ""dax"" and ""dax"" and results in ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" is at the end and results in ""yellow.""
- In the third example, it starts and ends with ""zup"" and both instances result in ""yellow.""
- The fourth example has ""zup"" at the end again with a result of ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" begins the series resulting in ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, ""zup"" does not seem dependent on any specific position or surrounding words to result in the color yellow. Instead, every time ""zup"" appears in the input, regardless of its position, the output color is yellow.

Thus, the rule is:

zup -> yellow",1.0,191,zup
"Analyzing the given examples:

1. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""walm"" at the end correspond to multiple ""green""

2. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow
   - ""wif"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""red""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - Since ""zup"" is at the end and it corresponds to ""yellow"", it doesn’t provide much information about its meaning yet.

3. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   - ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue""
   - The first ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is followed by ""green"" from ""dax"". The second ""zup"" is also followed by ""blue"" from ""lug"". There's a repeating pattern here.
   
4. Input: dax bluf wif zup
   Output: green green red yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red"". ""bluf"" is variable, which has corresponded to ""red"" previously.

5. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" once again. ""zup"" at the beginning corresponds to ""yellow"".

Based on the provided examples, ""zup"" seems to trigger a color change in the sequence or represent a specific color in the output, which is ""yellow."" When ""zup"" is at the start or end of a sequence, it translates to ""yellow."" The meaning is consistent despite the terms that follow or precede it. When ""zup"" is in the middle, the colors before and after it adhere to the other word-color associations. ""zup"" does not affect these associations, meaning it has a standalone representation.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",0.9,191,zup
"Rule: 

The meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" seems to be based on the color associated with the word that precedes it in the sequence. When ""zup"" is the first word, or when it follows ""lug"", ""wif"", or ""bluf"", it is translated as yellow. When it follows ""dax"" it is translated as green. This suggests that ""zup"" is a kind of placeholder that takes on a color based on a rule related to the preceding word. 

However, there is not enough data to determine the exact rule for how ""zup"" takes on a color from the preceding word because ""walm"" does not directly precede ""zup"" in any examples, so we cannot determine what color ""zup"" would be in that case. There might be a default color that it takes when the rule does not apply (as when it is the first word), but with the given examples, it is safe to assume that ""zup"" changes based on the preceding word, with some precedence rules possibly occurring.

zup -> When following:
- ""lug"", ""wif"", or ""bluf"", translates as yellow.
- ""dax"", translates as green. 
- When it is the first word or the rule is not clear, it defaults to yellow.",0.9,191,zup
"bluf -> color replication based on the preceding word. Rule:

The word that comes before ""bluf"" determines the color to be reproduced twice in the output. The mappings for the given examples are:

"Rule: bluf -> the word that precedes ""bluf"" is translated into a color, and then ""bluf"" is represented by repeating that color. 

For instance, ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and thus ""bluf"" dictates that the color be repeated. Similarly, ""dax bluf"" becomes ""green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" The rule is consistent regardless of the position of ""bluf"" in the sequence; it always means to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it.",1.0,191,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, ""bluf"" seems to correspond to repeating the color word associated with the preceding input word. Here is the inferred rule:

- The word before ""bluf"" defines a specific color.
- When ""bluf"" appears, it takes the color signified by the previous word and repeats it once if the word is alone or twice if it follows ""zup"" (as seen in the fourth input where ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow"").
- When multiple colors appear before ""bluf"" without an interceding ""zup,"" the pattern is to repeat the directly preceding color.
- ""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""wif,"" and ""walm"" seem to correspond to ""blue,"" ""green,"" ""red,"" and ""blue,"" respectively.
- The repetition is not infinite; it seems limited to one or two instances depending on whether ""zup"" is included, rather than reverting further back in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color signified by the previous word once or, when following ""zup,"" repeat the color twice.",1.0,191,bluf
"bluf -> color repetition based on the preceding word.

Rule: The word bluf causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated. For example, lug is associated with blue, so ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue"". Similarly, dax is associated with green, so ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green"". When multiple words precede bluf, as in ""dax zup bluf"", the pattern continues with the color associated with each of the preceding words being repeated in the order they appear – ""green yellow yellow"".",1.0,191,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can analyze the output patterns in relation to the presence of the word ""walm"" in the input.

The first step is observing the output color each time ""walm"" is present in the input:

1. In the first input, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the output gives a sequence of three reds (red red red) associated with ""walm lug."" The word ""lug"" alone is translated into blue in other contexts.

2. In the second input, ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" and the output is two blues (blue blue) followed by a single ""lug"" output of blue. 

3. In the third input, there is only one instance of ""walm,"" and it is preceded by ""zup"" and ""bluf lug zup."" The output for ""walm"" in this context is three yellows in a row (yellow yellow yellow).

4. In the fourth input, ""walm"" occurs twice, both times after ""lug,"" and each instance of ""walm"" is followed by three blues (blue blue blue).

5. In the fifth input, ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" and the output is three reds (red red red).

From the above observations, it can be seen that ""walm"" generates a pattern of three colors in the output corresponding to the color that would otherwise be represented by the word preceding ""walm."" For example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" to red, and ""zup"" seems to correspond to yellow.

Rule: When “walm” appears in the input, the output is a repetition of three of the same color that would be represented by the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

So we can infer:

walm -> meaning. Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.",1.0,191,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze how it affects the output in each example.

- In the first example, when ""walm"" follows ""lug wif,"" the output color after ""red"" is red repeating, implying that ""lug"" is blue and ""wif"" is red. ""Walm"" appears to cause the color mentioned right before it to repeat.
  
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the color ""blue"" repeats after the word ""walm."" 

- In the third example, ""walm"" does not immediately follow any color-word, but the output shortly after ""walm"" is a repetition of ""yellow,"" which is the previous color.

- In the fourth example, ""walm"" occurs twice, both times following ""lug,"" which we have associated with the color blue. In the output, the color blue repeats after each ""walm.""

- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and we see ""red"" repeat three times in the output, which aligns with the previous findings that ""wif"" correlates with the color red.

Based on this consistent pattern across all examples, we can conclude that ""walm"" causes the color right before it to repeat in the output sequence.

Rule: walm -> causes the previous color to repeat in the output sequence.",1.0,191,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the word ""walm"" induces repetition of the color associated with the word just before it. Let's look at how this rule applies in each example:

- In the first example, ""lug wif walm lug"" corresponds to ""blue red red red blue"". ""Wif"" is associated with ""red"", and the presence of ""walm"" after ""wif"" results in repeating ""red"" three times.
  
- In the second example, ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue"". The word ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"", and after ""walm"" it's repeated twice.
  
- In the third example, ""zup walm"" ends with ""yellow yellow"". Again, ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which is associated with ""yellow"", and ""yellow"" is then repeated.
  
- The fourth example has ""lug walm zup lug walm"". After the first ""lug walm"", ""blue blue"" appears, and ""yellow blue blue"" follows ""zup lug walm"". Here ""walm"" repeats the preceding color twice.
  
- In the final example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"". ""Wif"" precedes ""walm"", resulting in ""red"" being repeated three times.

So, in each case, ""walm"" is causing the immediate prior word's associated color to be repeated. It appears that the number of repetitions is equal to the number of times ""walm"" appears immediately after a color word plus one (for the original occurrence of the color).

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word, adding one additional occurrence beyond the initial one for each consecutive ""walm"".",1.0,191,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to examine the correspondence between the input and output sequences, paying particular attention to the instances where ""walm"" appears.

Here are the observations:

1. When ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" the output is a sequence of ""blue red.""
   - Example: ""lug wif walm lug"" -> ""blue red red red blue""
   - Example: ""lug walm zup lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue""

2. When ""walm"" appears after ""zup,"" the sequence is ""yellow yellow.""
   - Example: ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""

3. When ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" the sequence is ""red red red.""
   - Example: ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""

It appears that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word preceding it two or three times, depending on that word. If ""lug"" precedes it, ""walm"" results in ""red"" repeated three times. If ""zup"" or ""wif"" precedes it, ""walm"" results in the previous color repeated twice.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word two times if it's ""zup"" or ""wif,"" three times if it's ""lug.""",0.8,191,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's first identify the pattern of words that correspond with the given colors in each example. Each input word seems to correspond with a specific color in the output based on its presence and position, except for ""walm,"" which appears to add complexity to it.

Here's what we can deduce from the examples:

1. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
2. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
3. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
4. ""bluf"" corresponds to some form of iteration or repetition, as it seems to convert the previous color into two of the same colors, as shown in example 1 (bluf -> blue blue) and example 3 (bluf -> yellow yellow).

However, ""bluf"" is not present in all examples, and it does not fully explain the role of ""walm."" Look at how ""walm"" impacts the sequence:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the output is three ""red"" before a ""blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" modifies the color that follows it to output three of a preceding color before outputting the intended color.
2. In the second example, ""walm"" appears in the middle, and it outputs ""blue"" before it without any apparent change. However, after ""walm,"" ""zup"" which would normally correspond to ""yellow,"" results in the sequence ""blue yellow blue,"" adding an extra ""blue"" before outputting the ""yellow.""
3. The third example doesn't have enough context post-""walm"" to determine the effect precisely.
4. The fourth example has ""walm"" before a ""zup"" into ""lug"" sequence, resulting in blue blue blue, suggesting that ""walm"" indeed adds blue before the subsequent color.
5. The fifth example sees ""walm"" following ""wif"" and outputs ""red red red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" generates two additional instances of the color that preceded it.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it duplicates the prior color in the sequence two additional times before proceeding to ouptut the intended color of the next word.

Rule: walm -> Duplicate the color corresponding to the preceding word twice before outputting the next color. If ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence or is followed by ""lug,"" ""walm"" results in three consecutive appearances of the color that preceded it.",0.8,191,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each example.",1.0,192,lug
"By examining the patterns before and after ""lug"" in the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" is mentioned in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

- In the first example, ""lug"" follows ""wif"" and translates to ""blue"" after ""red"".
- In the second example ""lug"" occurs twice, both times being translated to ""blue"" in the output.
- In the third example, ""wif lug wif"" translates to ""red blue red,"" with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"" once again.
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" follows ""zup"" twice and each time translates to ""blue"" in the output.
- In the fifth example, ""zup lug"" translates directly to ""yellow blue,"" matching the rule deduced.

Thus, the rule appears quite straightforward:

Rule: lug -> blue",1.0,192,lug
"lug -> blue

"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.",1.0,192,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,192,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" seems to correlate with the color ""red"" as part of its meaning. In instances where ""wif"" appears, the color red is included in the output. Here is the pattern observed:

- wif dax -> red green (wif corresponds to ""red"")
- wif bluf -> red red (""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""bluf"" likely corresponds to another ""red"")
- wif walm -> red red red (""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""walm"" likely corresponds to two instances of ""red"")
- lug zup wif -> blue yellow red (""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red"")

Each time the word ""wif"" is used, the color ""red"" appears in the output. Given that the output varies depending on the other words present, ""wif"" appears to translate consistently to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,192,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Each occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds directly to an instance of ""red"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule can be written as follows:

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" appears to correspond to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, a ""red"" appears in the output. Here is how the rule applies to each example:

- wif dax -> red green (here ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and it seems ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"")
- wif bluf -> red red (both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""red"")
- wif walm -> red red red (here ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and it seems ""walm"" corresponds to ""red red"")
- lug zup wif -> blue yellow red (here ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"")

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,192,wif
"Based on the given examples, it seems that 'wif' correlates with the color 'red.' Each time 'wif' appears in the input, the word 'red' appears in the output. The number of colors in the output matches the number of words in the input after removing 'wif.' Here are the possible interpretations:

- In the first input, 'wif' is followed by one other word 'dax,' and the output is two colors 'red green.' Here, 'wif' corresponds to 'red,' and 'dax' possibly to 'green.' However, since 'dax' only appears once, we cannot confirm its meaning confidently.
  
- In the second and third inputs, 'wif' is followed by 'bluf,' and the output is 'red red.' Since 'wif' seems to correspond to 'red,' 'bluf' may also correspond to 'red,' giving us 'red red' each time 'wif bluf' appears.

- In the fourth input, 'wif walm' corresponds to 'red red red.' It's clear that 'wif' is 'red,' and it seems 'walm' similarly might correspond to 'red red,' but it could also be that 'walm' equals one 'red' and the repetition is a specific rule for 'walm.' However, with a single example, we can't be certain.

- Finally, in the fifth input, 'lug zup wif' corresponds to 'blue yellow red.' 'Wif' is at the end and corresponds to 'red,' while 'lug' could correspond to 'blue' and 'zup' to 'yellow,' but those are uncertain without further examples.

Thus, the rule seems to be that the word 'wif' translates to 'red' in the output, while the meanings of the other nonce words are not determined with certainty based on the given examples. The rule is:

Rule: wif -> red",0.9,192,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we examine the pattern of inputs and outputs in the examples given. Here is the pattern that emerges:

- Whenever ""wif"" is followed by a single word, the output is ""red"" repeated as many times as there are syllables in the word following ""wif.""
- When ""wif"" is positioned at the end of the sequence, after ""lug zup,"" the output is ""blue yellow red,"" suggesting that ""wif"" might be the trigger for ""red,"" while the preceding words have their own associated colors.

From these examples, we can infer:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the output of ""red,"" and the number of times ""red"" is repeated in the output is equal to the number of syllables in the word that follows ""wif."" If ""wif"" is at the end of the sequence without a following word, it still corresponds to ""red.""

Given that ""zup"" is interspersed with these other words and the corresponding output colors, it can be observed that ""zup"" always results in ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the context provided by the surrounding words.

"Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" can be deduced as follows:

- The second example, ""lug zup,"" maps to ""blue yellow."" This reinforces the concept that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

- The third example, ""dax bluf zup,"" maps to ""green green yellow."" Here, ""dax"" and ""bluf"" both seem to correspond to ""green,"" which, while introducing new words, still keeps the meaning of ""zup"" consistent with ""yellow.""

- The fourth example, ""lug bluf zup lug,"" maps to ""blue blue yellow blue."" ""Bluf"" again corresponds to ""blue"" as in the third example, and the position of ""zup"" between the ""blue"" still gives it the meaning ""yellow.""

- The fifth example, ""zup lug zup bluf lug,"" maps to ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue."" This example requires careful attention because it suggests that ""zup"" can correspond to ""yellow,"" but when followed by ""bluf,"" the meaning of ""zup bluf"" together corresponds to ""yellow yellow."" This could introduce an inconsistency or a more complex rule, however, since the task here is to deduce the meaning of ""zup"" alone and all other instances remain consistent, it seems more likely that ""bluf"" should be analyzed separately, and thus ""zup"" maintains its meaning as ""yellow.""

""Zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" following it repeats the color yellow three times.

Finally, in the fifth example:

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

""Lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" to red, and ""bluf"" seems to have no effect on the rule since ""walm"" has already occurred and repeated the color associated with the word that came before it.

From these inputs and outputs, it can be deduced that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to be repeated three times.",1.0,192,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer that the word ""walm"" is associated with repeating the color word that precedes it multiple times. To validate this, let's break down the examples:

1. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   In this example, ""wif"" follows ""lug"" and ""walm"" follows ""wif"". The output shows ""red"" repeated three times after ""blue"", likely because ""wif"" translates to ""red"".

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   We only have ""lug"" before ""walm"" and see that ""blue"" is repeated three times in the output, signaling that ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times.

3. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue
   ""Dax"" is followed by ""walm"", which leads to ""green"" being repeated three times before moving on to the next color translation for ""zup"" and ""lug"".

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Only ""zup"" precedes ""walm"", and ""yellow"" is repeated three times. This reinforces the pattern of ""walm"" repeating the preceding color word thrice.

5. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   The first instance of ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"", which results in ""blue"" being repeated three times. This pattern continues throughout the examples provided where ""lug"" could also be followed by ""bluf"" and yield an output of ""blue blue"".

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. To elaborate:

- In the first example, ""lug wif walm"" translates to ""blue red red red."" The word right before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, and ""walm"" results in three repetitions of red.
  
- In the second example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" causes two more blues to follow.

- In the third example, ""dax walm zup lug"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue."" ""Dax"" corresponds to green, followed by two additional greens due to ""walm,"" then the sequence continues as normal with ""zup"" and ""lug"" resulting in yellow and blue, respectively.

- In the fourth example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" leads to two more yellows.

- In the fifth example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue blue."" The first ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""walm"" results in two more blues, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and the second ""lug"" leads to blue, followed by ""bluf"" doubling the blue.

Rule: bluf -> blue,0.6,193,bluf
"From the provided examples, we can infer the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" by examining the patterns of input and corresponding output.

Looking at the outputs, we can notice that ""walm"" seems to correspond to a color, and the specific color it maps to depends on the word that appears immediately before it:

- In the first example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" this suggests that ""walm"" after ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- In the second and third examples, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green,"" this suggests that ""walm"" after ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue,"" this suggests that ""walm"" after ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Given that ""walm"" consistently replicates the color of the word right before it, we can deduce:

Rule: walm -> takes on the color of the word preceding it.",1.0,193,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can look at the patterns in the input and corresponding output.

Looking closely:

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is three yellow colors.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is three greens.
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is three blues.
- When ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" regardless of the previous word, the output is a red color.

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" acts as a repetition indicator for the color corresponding to the word that precedes it, except when followed by ""wif,"" which then results in red. In other words, ""walm"" seems to mean ""repeat the color of the previous word three times,"" and when followed by ""wif,"" it results in a sequence of three repetitions of the previous color followed by red.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word three times if not followed by ""wif"". If followed by ""wif,"" repeat the color of the previous word three times followed by red.",0.9,193,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" affects the color assigned to the words that immediately follow it. Specifically, it causes the next one or more words to take on the color of the word that precedes ""walm"". To elaborate:

- In the first example, ""zup walm dax lug,"" ""dax"" and ""lug"" are both colored yellow, which is the color assigned to ""zup."" Since ""walm"" comes right after ""zup,"" it could be inferred that ""walm"" causes the words ""dax lug"" to be colored yellow.

- In the second example, ""dax lug walm,"" the word ""lug"" following ""walm"" is colored blue, which is the same color as both ""dax"" and ""lug"" that come before ""walm.""

- For the third and fifth examples (""dax walm wif"" and ""lug walm wif""), ""wif"" is colored green and blue respectively, matching the colors of ""dax"" and ""lug"" that precede ""walm.""

- Finally, in the fourth example, ""lug walm dax wif lug wif,"" the word ""dax"" following ""walm"" is colored green, like ""lug"" before it, but ""wif"" after ""dax"" changes to red, breaking the pattern. Since there is another ""lug wif"" sequence after that and ""lug"" is blue, ""wif"" following it is also blue, as it was in the previous patterns.

Considering the word that breaks the pattern is ""wif,"" which causes a color change to red, this suggests that the effect of ""walm"" may only last for a set number of words or until a word that dictates its own color appears, in this case ""wif.""

Based on these observations, the rule induced for ""walm"" is that it causes the one or more following words to take on the color of the word that immediately precedes ""walm,"" until a word that dictates its own color appears.

Rule: walm -> Causes the following word(s) to take on the color of the previous word until a word with a predefined color appears.",0.8,193,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to analyze the input and corresponding output patterns to infer a rule. Let's compare the provided examples:

1. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

3. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red

4. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

5. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red

From these examples, notice that sequences in the input that have ""walm"" result in the following output sequences where multiple colors are the same followed by a different color:

1. After ""zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
2. In the case of ""lug walm"" or ""dax walm,"" the output is a repetition of the previous color after ""lug"" or ""dax,"" followed by another color.
3. When ""walm"" is the last word in the input sequence, the output sequence ends with ""blue.""

Based on these observations, ""walm"" seems to mean ""repeat the previous color.""

Rule: walm -> repeat the previous color.",0.8,193,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look at the invariance in the provided input-output pairs. 

From the examples given:

1. Input: zup walm dax lug 
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

2. Input: dax lug walm 
   Output: green blue blue blue

3. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red

4. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

5. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red

By comparing the outputs, we can observe the following pattern:

- In examples 1, 3, 4, and 5, the occurrence of the word ""walm"" consistently results in a repetition of the color corresponding to the last word mentioned before ""walm."" For instance:

   In Example 1, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" which corresponds to yellow, and we see a repetition of ""yellow"" thrice.
   In Example 3, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" corresponding to green, and we see ""green"" repeated three times.
   In Example 4, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" which corresponds to blue, and we see ""blue"" repeated three times.
   In Example 5, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" corresponding to blue, and we see ""blue"" repeated three times.

- In example 2, even though ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, the repetition rule still seems to apply since ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue. Hence, the output has ""blue"" repeated twice after the occurrence of ""lug.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color of the word that comes directly before it to repeat for a number of times equal to the number of letters in ""walm."" Since ""walm"" has four letters, the color repeats four times including the original mention of the color before ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule is:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" four times in total (including the original occurrence).",0.8,193,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""lug,"" let's compare the input and output pairs word by word to check the association between the nonce word ""lug"" and the other words present in the input:

1. In the first input-output pair:
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.

2. In the second input-output pair:
   - The word ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue"" and appears twice in the output.

3. For the third input-output pair:
   - The presence of ""lug"" once again corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.

4. In the fourth input-output pair:
   - ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"" in the output.

5. Finally, in the fifth input-output pair:
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" which is consistent with the previous pairs.

Considering the above observations, we find that ""lug"" consistently relates to ""blue"" irrespective of its position within the input sequence or the presence of other words.

Rule: lug -> ""blue"".",1.0,194,lug
"lug -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule:

From the input-output examples provided, the word ""lug"" seems to be translated into the color ""blue."" Additionally, it appears that when ""lug"" is followed by another word, it causes a repetition in the output. Specifically, it seems to duplicate the color that is represented by the word following ""lug."" To verify if this is consistent, let's apply it to each example:

- Input: lug zup dax zup
  Output: blue yellow green yellow
  ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" Since ""zup"" follows ""lug,"" ""yellow"" is not repeated – this might be because ""dax"" (translated as ""green"") interrupts the sequence. 

- Input: wif walm lug bluf
  Output: red red red blue blue
  Here ""wif"" and ""walm"" both translate to ""red."" When ""lug"" appears before ""bluf"" (translated as ""blue""), ""blue"" is repeated once after ""lug.""

- Input: dax bluf lug wif
  Output: green green blue red
  For this example, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" to ""blue."" ""lug"" precedes ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" but ""red"" does not appear directly after ""lug."" This could imply that ""lug"" repeats the color that directly follows it.

- Input: dax lug wif walm
  Output: green blue red red red
  ""Dax"" is ""green"" and ""lug"" is followed by ""wif"" which is translated as ""red"" in the output. Here, ""red"" appears three times, once for ""lug,"" once for ""wif,"" and once for ""walm.""

- Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
  Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
  ""Zup"" and ""walm"" are both ""yellow."" When ""lug"" precedes ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" we see ""blue,"" then ""red"" occurs twice - one that can be considered the effect of ""lug"" and the other for ""wif.""

Given this information, the rule for ""lug"" seems to be that it translates to the color ""blue"" and causes the next color in the sequence (or the next word's corresponding color) to appear twice in the output. Note that any word for a color that occurs before ""lug"" is not repeated, but the duplication occurs only with the color represented by the word that directly follows ""lug.""

Therefore, the rule is:

lug -> blue and causes the next color to be repeated once.",0.8,194,lug
"In each example, ""lug"" appears to result in a repetition of the color word that follows it. Let's confirm this by examining each input-output pair in detail:

1. lug zup dax zup = blue yellow green yellow
""lug zup"" leads to ""blue yellow""

2. wif walm lug bluf = red red red blue blue
""lug bluf"" leads to ""red blue blue""

3. dax bluf lug wif = green green blue red
""lug wif"" leads to ""blue red""

4. dax lug wif walm = green blue red red red
""lug wif"" leads to ""blue red red""

5. zup walm lug wif bluf = yellow yellow yellow blue red red
""lug wif"" leads to ""blue red red""

The rule seems to be that ""lug"" causes the color that follows it to be repeated one extra time, except it is not clear why ""lug wif"" in the fourth input leads to ""blue red red"" instead of just ""blue red"". If we consider that possibly the color that is supposed to be repeated (due to the presence of ""walm"" which seems to indicate ""red"") is influencing the repetition count, we could assume that ""lug"" followed by a color causes the repetition of that color, and if ""walm"" follows ""lug"", then the following color word ""wif"" is repeated twice since ""walm"" itself indicates ""red"" and seems to carry a rule for word repetition too.

However, without additional information or examples, it isn't fully clear how ""lug"" interacts with words that might have their own repetition rules, like ""walm"" seems to. For the purpose of this explanation, I'll propose a general rule based on the majority of the examples:

Rule: lug -> causes the next color word to be repeated one additional time.",0.8,194,lug
"Rule: ""lug"" is substituted by repeating the last color in the output, with ""lug"" occurring an additional time beyond the repetition. 

The examples break down as follows:

- ""lug zup dax zup"" results in ""blue yellow green yellow"". We see that after ""lug"", ""blue"" is placed (and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" to ""green""). The word ""lug"" is not represented by a new color but seems to repeat ""blue"".

- ""wif walm lug bluf"" results in ""red red red blue blue"". Here, ""wif"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""red"". ""lug"" follows two ""red""s, resulting in a third ""red"". ""bluf"" then corresponds to ""blue"", which appears two times at the end, possibly due to the occurrence of ""lug"".

- ""dax bluf lug wif"" results in ""green green blue red"". ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""bluf"" to ""blue"", and then ""lug"" repeats ""blue"" before proceeding with ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"".

- ""dax lug wif walm"" results in ""green blue red red red"". ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" repeats this ""green"" as ""blue"" (potentially indicating that ""lug"" changes the repeated color accordingly), followed by ""wif"" and ""walm"" which both correspond to ""red"".

- ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"". ""zup"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""yellow"". ""lug"" repeats ""yellow"" and as seen from previous examples, seems to add an extra occurrence of the last stated color. ""wif"" then corresponds to ""red"", and ""bluf"" to ""blue"", with an extra ""red"" repeating likely because of ""lug"".

So in summary: 
lug -> meaning. Repeat the last color mentioned and add an extra occurrence of that color after the original sequence.",0.8,194,lug

bluf -> repeat the color associated with the previous word.",1.0,194,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. Rule: Based on the given examples, bluf corresponds to the color red when preceded by wif, and yellow when preceded by zup. There is no example with dax followed by a single bluf to justify its output, but the pattern suggests that bluf takes the color of the word immediately preceding it. However, there may be a discrepancy or lack of information regarding the input ""dax bluf wif zup"" as there isn't a direct way to deduce why ""bluf"" in this context corresponds to green. It's possible that the example may have additional rules not represented in the other examples, or there may be an error. With the information given, a safe rule to infer is:
Rule: When bluf is preceded by another word, it takes on the color of that preceding word:

- zup -> yellow, hence bluf -> yellow when following zup.",0.75,194,bluf
"Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word. 

The examples show that every time ""walm"" is used, the output repeats the color associated with the word that comes before ""walm."" If there is no word before ""walm,"" as in the third example, ""walm"" does not repeat any color and is not represented in the output.

- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.

When ""walm"" follows any of these words, the output repeats the color of the word preceding ""walm."" When ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" green is repeated three times. When it comes after ""wif,"" red is repeated three times, and so on. In the case where ""walm"" stands alone (""dax walm""), it simply results in the color green being stated three times without repetition.",1.0,194,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word. 

Observing the examples given, whenever ""walm"" follows a word, the color corresponding to that word is repeated three times, except when ""dax"" is the word that follows ""walm"". In this specific case, the pattern is ""green green green red green,"" which suggests that ""dax"" may introduce a complexity to the pattern. However, the consistent aspect of the pattern is that the color of the preceding word is repeated three times before whatever output ""dax"" directly influences.",1.0,194,walm
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to trigger a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it up to three times, followed by the color associated with the word that follows it. When the pattern ""X walm Y"" is observed, ""X"" is repeated three times in the color associated with ""X,"" and then the color associated with ""Y"" is listed once.

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow

The rule appears to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" is present between two words, it causes the output to repeat the color associated with the first word three times, followed by the color associated with the second word once.

Therefore: walm -> (triggers repetition of the preceding color x3, followed by the succeeding color x1)",1.0,194,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""walm,"" followed by the color associated with ""dax"" which is green, if ""dax"" comes immediately after ""walm."" When ""dax"" does not immediately follow ""walm,"" then only the color associated with the word before ""walm"" is repeated three times.

Let's break down the examples:

1. Input: dax walm wif dax
   Output: green green green red green
   Here, ""walm"" is proceeded by ""dax"" (green), then followed by ""wif"" (red) and then ""dax"" again (green). The sequence is green thrice, then red (from ""wif""), then green (from the second ""dax"").

2. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   Here, ""walm"" is proceeded by ""lug"" (blue), then followed by ""dax"" (green). The sequence is blue thrice, then green.

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Here, ""walm"" is proceeded by ""dax"" (green), with nothing following ""walm."" The sequence is green thrice.

4. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   Here, ""walm"" is proceeded by ""wif"" (red), then followed by ""dax"" (green). The sequence is red thrice, then green.

5. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Here, ""walm"" is proceeded by ""wif"" (red), with nothing following ""walm."" Note the output starts with ""yellow,"" which likely associates with ""zup"", indicating that ""zup"" does not interact with the rule induced by ""walm."" The sequence following ""zup"" is therefore red thrice.

Rule:
walm -> Causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times. If ""dax"" follows ""walm,"" then ""green"" is added to the sequence after the repetition. If ""dax"" does not follow ""walm,"" no additional color is added after the repetition (unless there is another word after ""walm,"" which is not accounted for in the examples and may follow separate rules).",0.9,194,walm
"From the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the word ""walm"". Each example includes the word ""walm"" followed by colors as part of the output. The repetition of a color seems related to the word before ""walm"" and then a different color appears after these repeated ones, typically following the last word in the input that is not ""walm"". Let’s look at the examples in detail:

1. ""dax walm wif dax"" results in ""green green green red green"". Before ""walm"", we have ""dax"", and after ""walm"", we have ""wif dax"". The first ""dax"" leads to three repetitions of ""green"", then after ""walm"" the sequence changes, we have a ""red"" which correlates with ""wif"" and then a ""green"" again for the final ""dax"".

2. ""lug walm dax"" results in ""blue blue blue green"". ""Lug"" leads to three repetitions of ""blue"", then ""dax"" after ""walm"" is ""green"".

3. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"". Without another word after ""walm"", the color that corresponds to ""dax"" is repeated three times.

4. ""wif walm dax"" results in ""red red red green"". ""Wif"" leads to three repetitions of ""red"", then ""dax"" after ""walm"" is ""green"".

5. ""zup wif walm"" results in ""yellow red red red"". ""zup"" leads to one ""yellow"", then ""wif"" after ""walm"" is repeated thrice as ""red"".

From this analysis, we can induce that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word before ""walm"". The number of repetitions seems to be three, although the first example complicated the pattern since there are multiple colors after ""walm"". The last word in the input provides the next color in the sequence after the repetitions. However, the ""zup"" example breaks the pattern slightly, as it results in only one ""yellow"" instead of three, so the rule is not perfect.

With some inconsistency noted in the ""zup"" case, the best inductive rule for ""walm"" based on the available data seems to be:

Rule:
Walm -> Triggers the repetition of three occurrences of the color corresponding to the word that precedes it, followed by the color corresponding to the next word. If another instance of the preceding word follows ""walm"", it is once more translated into its corresponding color after the series of three. If there is no word after ""walm"", only the color corresponding to the preceding word is repeated thrice.",0.7,194,walm
"Based on the input-output examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule that the word ""lug"" represents.

Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
Input: zup dax lug -> Output: yellow green blue
Input: dax lug -> Output: green blue
Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
Input: lug wif -> Output: blue red

Here's what we can extract from the above inputs and outputs:

- Whenever ""lug"" is present, the colour ""blue"" always appears in the output, suggesting that ""lug"" might be represented by the colour ""blue.""

To confirm this hypothesis, let's test it:
- In the first input, ""lug"" is paired with ""wif,"" and the output is ""red blue,"" so ""wif"" could mean ""red.""
- In the second input, ""lug"" follows ""zup dax,"" and the output is ""yellow green blue."" Since ""dax lug"" by itself results in ""green blue,"" ""zup"" could mean ""yellow"" and ""dax"" could mean ""green""; ""lug"" again is represented by ""blue.""
- The fourth input is more complex with different words, but ""lug"" matches ""blue"" while the other pairs seem consistent with previous outputs (e.g., ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red"").

Based on this, the rule seems to be quite straightforward:

Rule: wif -> red,1.0,195,wif
"Based on the presented examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" correlates with a specific color output each time it is mentioned.

In all examples given, whenever the input includes the word ""wif"", the output consistently contains the color ""red"". This consistent pairing allows us to induce the meaning of ""wif"" in the context of these examples.

Therefore, we can deduce the rule as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,195,wif

- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

Thus, ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in all examples, regardless of its position relative to other words.

In the context where ""zup"" appears, it always corresponds to the output ""yellow."" The word ""dax"" is used in one example and corresponds to ""green.""

The rule for ""zup"" seems to be consistent and does not depend on the position in the sequence or the presence of other words. Therefore, it appears that ""zup"" has a fixed meaning.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,195,zup
"Based on the examples given, we can start by breaking down each input with its corresponding output to find a pattern:

3. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
4. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" there is no direct example, but we can ignore this as we have enough consistency by looking at the first three points.

"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following pattern:

- Every time ""bluf"" follows a word, the output color is the same as the color of the word that precedes ""bluf"".
  - ""wif dax bluf"" translates to ""red green green"", where ""green"" repeats after ""dax"".
  - ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"", where ""red"" repeats after ""wif"".

Therefore, based on the given examples, the rule concerning the word ""bluf"" appears to be:

4. In the instance where ""bluf"" is followed by another word, such as ""lug,"" the ""bluf"" still corresponds to the color yellow, and ""lug"" translates to blue. 

From these examples, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" corresponds to the output of the color that directly preceded it. If ""bluf"" is followed by another word, it does not appear to influence the color that ""bluf"" translates to.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the examples provided.

1. After ""lug"" (blue), the sequence ""walm dax"" results in ""blue green blue"".
2. When ""walm"" and ""dax"" appear together without any other words between them, the output is ""green green green"".
3. After ""lug"" (blue), the single word ""walm"" results in ""blue blue"".
4. When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), the output is ""green green"".
5. When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), the output is ""yellow yellow"".

From these observations, we see ""walm"" tends to repeat the color of the previous word, with a bias towards blue when it follows ""lug"" (blue). However, when paired directly with ""dax"", it’s resulting in a sequence of green.

These results suggest that the word ""walm"" probably represents the color of the preceding word, with the following tendencies:
- After ""lug"" (blue), it produces additional blue.
- After any other color, it produces more of that same color.
- When paired with ""dax"" regardless of order, it results in green.

Therefore, the rule is as follows:

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the meaning of ""lug"" does not change depending on its position in the input. The following are the deductions from the examples:

1. Input: lug

2. Input: dax lug

3. Input: lug walm

   - ""lug"" results in a single ""blue"", and ""walm"" seems to triple the output associated with the preceding word. Since there's only ""lug"" before it, ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times.

   Output: green blue
   - This is a repetition of the second example, reaffirming the meanings of ""dax"" and ""lug"".

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
- Here we can infer that ""bluf"" might mean ""green"" since we know the output for ""dax"" already.

Based on these observations, here is the rule I deduced:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Other words might correspond to other colors, but in these examples, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""",1.0,196,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's first look at each input and its corresponding output to see if we can discern any patterns:

- Input: dax
  - Output: green
- Input: zup dax walm
  - Output: yellow green green green
- Input: lug dax
  - Output: blue green
- Input: dax wif zup
  - Output: green red yellow
- Input: dax bluf
  - Output: green green

We can see that every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" is part of the output:

- ""dax"" -> green
- ""zup dax"" -> yellow green
- ""lug dax"" -> blue green
- ""dax wif"" -> green red
- ""dax bluf"" -> green green

From this, it seems that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" However, for a more comprehensive understanding, we should consider the other words in the input as well:

- ""zup"" may correspond to ""yellow"" since ""zup dax walm"" outputs ""yellow green green green"" and ""dax wif zup"" outputs ""green red yellow,"" with ""zup"" being the last in the sequence but the first in the output.
- ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue,"" as seen in ""lug dax"" to ""blue green.""
- ""walm"" might not have a consistent color associated since its appearance has an output of three ""green"" in a row, indicating repetition or emphasis rather than a direct translation to a single color.
- ""wif"" likely corresponds to ""red,"" indicated by the input ""dax wif zup"" which translates to ""green red yellow.""
- ""bluf"" could imply a repetition of the color previously mentioned, supported by ""dax bluf"" translating to ""green green.""

Rule: ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"", and the meaning of other words seems to correspond to different specific colors or actions (e.g., repetition). ""Dax"" has a consistent one-to-one translation in the examples provided:

dax -> green",1.0,196,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rules:

1. ""dax"" always outputs ""green.""
2. Each unique word that is not ""dax"" corresponds to a unique color.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: Each distinct word corresponds to a specific color in the output, with ""dax"" consistently mapping to ""green.""",1.0,196,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color green regardless of its position in the input sequence.",1.0,196,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to analyze each example to see what the word, or presence of the word, correlates to in the output.

From the first input ""dax"" and the output ""green,"" we can hypothesize that ""dax"" correlates to the color ""green.""

Let's test this hypothesis against the other examples:

- In the second example, ""zup dax walm,"" the output is ""yellow green green green."" It seems that ""dax"" still correlates to a single ""green,"" but the presence of other words (""zup"" and ""walm"") also leads to the color ""green"" appearing multiple times. Perhaps ""zup"" and ""walm"" cause duplication of the subsequent color, in this case, caused by ""dax.""

- For ""lug dax,"" which produces ""blue green,"" we see that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green"" without duplication.

- In ""dax wif zup,"" the output is ""green red yellow."" It appears ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and because ""zup"" follows, ""red"" is not duplicated, instead ""yellow"" is added likely as a result of the ""zup."" So ""zup"" seems to be conditional in that it duplicates colors unless preceded by ""wif.""

- Lastly, ""dax bluf"" converts to ""green green."" This supports the theory of ""dax"" meaning ""green."" The word ""bluf"" might simply be another way to say ""green"" or it could indicate a duplication of the preceding color.

Therefore, by analyzing the input-output relationships, we can determine the following rule:

Rule: ""dax"" correlates to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position or the presence of other nonce words in the input.",0.8,196,dax
"Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color red. Each occurrence of ""wif"" in the input results in the color red in the output.",1.0,196,wif
Rule: wif corresponds to the color red.,1.0,196,wif
"Based on the examples provided, wif appears to correlate to the color red. However, there is an observed pattern of repetition related to the words that follow wif. Let's consider each case:

1. When wif is presented alone, it translates to ""red"".
2. When wif is followed by the word ""walm"", the output is ""red"" repeated three times.
3. When wif is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""bluf"", the output is green, followed by ""red"" repeated twice.
4. In ""wif dax zup walm"", wif translates to one ""red"", ""dax"" translates to ""green"", and ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow"" repeated thrice.
5. For ""zup wif lug"", ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", wif to ""red"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"".

It appears that wif consistently translates to ""red"". There's also a pattern that certain other nonce words may influence the amount of repetition of colors. ""Walm"" following another nonce word appears to cause the color associated with the preceding nonce word to be repeated three times. Without elaboration on what ""dax,"" ""zup,"" or ""lug"" translate to, or a pattern for their repetition, their impact on the output cannot be rule-defined in this context.

Thus, the initial induction would simply be ""wif"" correlates to the color ""red"", with additional rules potentially affecting the repetition based on other words in the sequence:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,196,wif
"From the given examples, we can observe that the nonce word ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red."" However, to understand the complete rule, we need to consider the behavior of the other words in the examples in relation to their outputs.

- In the first example, ""wif"" on its own translates to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif walm"" gives ""red red red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" may trigger a repetition of the color associated with ""wif,"" which is ""red."" The repetition is thrice, including the original instance of ""wif.""
- In the third example, ""dax wif bluf"" results in ""green red red."" This could imply that ""bluf"" also causes a repetition of the color related to ""wif,"" which is ""red."" The word ""dax"" is translated to ""green.""
- The fourth example, ""wif dax zup walm,"" outputs ""red green yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""dax"" is again ""green"" and ""zup"" appears to be ""yellow."" ""Walm"" once more seems to cause repetition, but it now affects ""zup,"" as evidenced by the threefold occurrence of ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup wif lug"" provides ""yellow red blue."" This shows ""zup"" as ""yellow"" consistently, ""wif"" again as ""red,"" and introduces ""lug"" as ""blue.""

Considering the repeating pattern, the simplest and most consistent conclusion we can draw is that ""wif"" translates to ""red."" Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,196,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""wif"" does not have a single fixed meaning, but rather its meaning is influenced by the words around it, with the number of repetitions of the output color being significant. However, we can infer that the word ""wif"" on its own corresponds to a single occurrence of the color red, as seen in the first example.

In all instances where ""wif"" appears, the output always involves the word red at least once. When ""wif"" is paired with another word, the output corresponds to red repeated a number of times that seems to be influenced by the other word(s) present. ""Walm"" and ""bluf"" seem to result in red being repeated three times, ""dax"" influences the next color to be green, and ""zup"" influences the next color to be yellow, with ""lug"" by itself translating to blue.

With this in mind, we can hazard a rule for ""wif"":

Rule: When ""wif"" is present, the first color in the output is always red. The repetition of red and the colors that follow seem to depend on the context provided by the other words.

Therefore, we have the rule: wif -> red (with context-dependent repetitions and subsequent colors)",0.8,196,wif

Thus, the rule can be defined as: bluf -> red.",0.0,196,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to correspond consistently to the color ""red."" When ""bluf"" is used in the input, the output is ""red."" Thus, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: bluf -> red",0.0,196,bluf
"Based on the provided input and output examples, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to two instances of the color red in the output sequence. Therefore, the rule deduced from the examples is:

bluf -> red red

Rule: When the nonce word ""bluf"" is present in the input, it translates to two consecutive occurrences of the word ""red"" in the output.",0.0,196,bluf
"walm -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to three instances of the color red. Each occurrence of ""walm"" in the input translates to ""red red red"" in the output.

Rule: ""walm"" indicates a sequence of three reds.",1.0,196,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color preceding it three times. 

When ""walm"" follows a color word, that color word is output once more before three instances of the color that precedes ""walm"". If ""walm"" is the last word, it still triggers a repetition of the preceding color three times.

For instance:
- In ""dax zup walm wif walm"", ""zup"" means yellow, so ""walm"" leads to three more yellows. ""Wif"" means red, so the next ""walm"" leads to three more reds.
- In ""dax zup walm wif"", ""walm"" after ""zup"" causes ""yellow"" to repeat three times, followed by ""red"" for ""wif"".
- In ""zup walm dax"", ""walm"" after ""zup"" causes ""yellow"" to repeat three times, and then ""green"" for ""dax"".
- In ""lug wif zup wif walm"", ""walm"" after ""wif"" causes ""red"" to repeat three times.
- In ""zup wif walm"", ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which translates to ""red"", causing ""red"" to be repeated three times.

Therefore, walm -> meaning. Meaning is the repetition of the last mentioned color three times.",1.0,196,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" corresponds to three consecutive ""red"" in the output.",1.0,196,walm
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word two additional times.,1.0,196,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we must identify patterns associated with it in the given examples:

1. Input: dax zup walm wif walm                             
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   
2. Input: dax zup walm wif                                   
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   
3. Input: zup walm dax                                       
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   
4. Input: lug wif zup wif walm                               
   Output: blue red yellow red red red
   
5. Input: zup wif walm                                       
   Output: yellow red red red

Now, let's analyze the position and frequency of ""walm"" in the examples and how they correlate to the outputs:

- In every instance where ""walm"" is present, it results in multiple ""red"" output colors; specifically, the number of reds after ""walm"" corresponds to the number of ""walm"" occurrences plus one.
- ""walm"" does not depend on its position (beginning, middle, end) for the number of red outputs.
- In instances where ""walm"" is not present, the color red does not appear.

Considering these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: Each occurrence of the word ""walm"" in an input results in an extra red in the output beyond what would normally correspond to the input.

walm -> meaning: The occurrence of ""walm"" causes the output to include an additional red color for each time ""walm"" appears.",0.9,196,walm

"Based on the provided examples, we can infer that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" In every example given, an instance of ""dax"" yields the output ""green,"" regardless of the surrounding words.

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,197,dax
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green"". Regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence or the surrounding words, the output for ""dax"" is always ""green"". This suggests that ""dax"" directly corresponds to the color ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,197,dax
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time the word ""dax"" is presented in the input, the word ""green"" is present in the output.

Therefore, the rule can be written as:

Rule: dax -> green",1.0,197,dax
"Given the data, it appears that the word ""dax"" directly translates to the color ""green"". This is based on the consistent observation that every time the word ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

"Given the usage of the nonce word ""wif"" in each instance, it appears to correlate to the color ""red."" Every time ""wif"" is used in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. Other words correlate with other colors; for example, it appears ""dax"" correlates with green, ""bluf"" correlates with red as well, ""lug"" with blue, ""zup"" with yellow, and ""walm"" might repeat the color that directly follows it in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red",1.0,197,wif
"Rule: zup corresponds to the color ""yellow"".",1.0,197,zup
"Looking at the input-output pairs, we can try to deduce the rule or meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" by focusing on the position where ""zup"" appears and the corresponding output color.

Here are the observations:

1. In every input where ""zup"" is present, the corresponding output color is ""yellow.""
2. No matter the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence, it consistently maps to ""yellow"" in the output sequence.
3. Other words like ""wif"", ""dax"", ""lug"", ""bluf,"" etc., map to different colors like ""red,"" ""green,"" ""blue,"" etc., but the mapping is consistent for ""zup"" every time.

Based on these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow

Meaning that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" whenever it appears in an input sequence.",1.0,197,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"", let's examine each example, looking at the position of ""zup"" and its corresponding output color.

1. wif walm dax zup
   - Output: red red red green yellow
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.

2. zup wif zup dax
   - Output: yellow red yellow green
   - Both instances of ""zup"" correspond to yellow.

3. zup bluf lug zup
   - Output: yellow yellow blue yellow
   - Both instances of ""zup"" correspond to yellow.

4. zup wif bluf zup lug
   - Output: yellow red red yellow blue
   - Both instances of ""zup"" correspond to yellow.

5. lug zup dax lug
   - Output: blue yellow green blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.

In each example, regardless of the position or surrounding words, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",1.0,197,zup
"Rule: Zup seems to correspond to the color yellow in the output. Whenever the word zup appears in the input, the word yellow appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Therefore: zup -> yellow.",1.0,197,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's examine the colors associated with it in each input-output pair:

1. In the first example (""wif walm dax zup""), ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.
2. In the second example (""zup wif zup dax""), ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" both times it appears.
3. In the third example (""zup bluf lug zup""), ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in both instances again.
4. In the fourth example (""zup wif bluf zup lug""), ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in both instances again.
5. In the fifth example (""lug zup dax lug""), ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.

Looking at these examples, it appears that every time the word ""zup"" is used, the color ""yellow"" is produced in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present. Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" seems consistent across all examples.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",1.0,197,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" signifies a repetition of the color associated with the directly preceding word. Here's the pattern observed in each example:

- In the first example, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and the corresponding output for ""dax"" is green, so ""bluf"" results in ""green.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" twice and the output for ""zup"" is yellow, so ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"" both times.
- In the third example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output for ""wif"" is red, so ""bluf"" results in ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" once and the output for ""dax"" is green, so ""bluf"" results in ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" once and the output for ""zup"" is yellow, so ""bluf"" results in ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the word immediately before it.",1.0,197,bluf
"Analyzing the examples:

1. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax

2. zup lug bluf zup bluf wif

3. dax lug wif bluf

4. dax bluf
   Output: green green

5. dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow

By examining the patterns, the color that follows ""bluf"" in the Output always matches the color that precedes ""bluf."" So if ""dax"" is green, then ""bluf"" after ""dax"" results in green. Likewise, if ""zup"" is yellow, then ""bluf"" after ""zup"" results in yellow.

Therefore, the rule appears to be: the word ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the color that comes just before it.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the preceding color word.",1.0,197,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine each example and try to understand the pattern:

Example 1: 
- Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
- Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

Example 2:
- Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
- Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red

Example 3:
- Input: dax lug wif bluf
- Output: green blue red red

Example 4:
- Input: dax bluf
- Output: green green

Example 5:
- Input: dax zup bluf
- Output: green yellow yellow

Based on the outputs, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that is associated with the immediately preceding word. Each time ""bluf"" appears, the color that is output repeats the color associated with the word before ""bluf"".

Example 1 shows that when ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green,"" since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Example 2 indicates that when ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow,"" since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Example 3 and 4 reinforce the idea that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word.

Therefore, the rule governing ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> meaning: repeat the color associated with the word immediately before ""bluf"".",1.0,197,bluf
"Observing the given examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" changes the output's color to the color that was generated by the previous input word. Here's the reasoning:

- In the first example, the first ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which outputs red, so ""bluf"" also outputs red.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which outputs blue, so ""bluf"" also outputs blue.
- In the third example, ""wif"" outputs red, then ""bluf"" comes after and also outputs red.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" comes right after ""dax,"" which outputs green, hence ""bluf"" also outputs green.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which outputs yellow, and ""bluf"" also results in yellow.

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be copying the color output of the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" outputs the same color as the word that comes directly before it.",1.0,197,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" does not have a fixed meaning, but rather its meaning seems to be conditioned by the word that precedes it. Analyzing the examples provided:

1. When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is a sequence starting with ""green"": 
   - dax bluf dax -> green green green
   - dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green
   - dax bluf -> green green

2. When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow"" repeated:
   - zup lug bluf zup bluf wif -> yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
   - dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow

Next, let's consider if ""bluf"" affects the color that comes after it:

- In ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" and the resulting colors are ""red"" followed by ""green,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" doesn't affect the following color in a way that's consistent across examples.
- In ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup"" and the color is ""yellow,"" but the same pattern is observed when ""zup"" is not preceded by ""bluf."" This again suggests the meaning of ""bluf"" is only conditioned by the preceding word and it does not influence the following color.

Thus, we can make the rule that ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word:

Rule: bluf repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it. If ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is green. If ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is yellow.",0.9,197,bluf
"Rule: walm -> green if the previous word is 'dax', and red if not.",1.0,197,walm
"Given the examples, it looks like the word ""walm"" corresponds to the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here’s my observation from the examples:

- In “lug zup dax walm,” the word before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" which outputs ""green."" The output for ""walm"" is ""green green green,"" suggesting that ""walm"" might mean a repetition of the preceding color three times.
- In ""wif walm dax,"" ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and the output for ""walm"" is ""red red red,"" which is the color associated with ""wif,"" repeated three times.
- In ""lug dax zup dax walm wif,"" the word before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green green,"" which is the color associated with ""dax,"" repeated three times.
- In ""lug walm zup wif,"" ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output for ""walm"" is ""blue blue blue,"" which is the color associated with ""lug,"" repeated three times.
- In ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm,"" ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and the output for ""walm"" is ""red red red,"" which is the color associated with ""wif,"" repeated three times.

Based on this pattern, we can indicate the rule:

walm -> meaning: The meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.

Rule: If x is the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm,"" then the output for ""walm"" is x repeated three times.",1.0,197,walm
Rule: walm -> repeat last color,1.0,197,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" from the given examples, let's look for patterns in how ""walm"" corresponds to the outputs.

Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green

Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
Output: blue green yellow green green green red

Input: lug walm zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow red

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

Here is what we can notice from the inputs and corresponding outputs:
- The word ""walm"" always results in the color ""red"" unless it is after the word ""dax,"" after which it becomes ""green."" This implies that the default color for ""walm"" is ""red,"" but it changes following a specific condition.
- In multiple instances, other words are consistently translating to specific colors: ""lug"" -> blue, ""dax"" -> green, ""zup"" -> yellow, ""wif"" -> red.
- No instances show ""walm"" following another word besides ""dax,"" so we can only confirm the rule change after ""dax.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:
- ""walm"" translates to ""red,"" except when it follows the word ""dax,"" after which it becomes ""green.""

Rule: walm -> red, except after ""dax,"" then walm -> green.",1.0,197,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let us examine its relation to the inputs and corresponding outputs:

1. lug zup dax walm -> blue yellow green green green
2. wif walm dax -> red red red green
3. lug dax zup dax walm wif -> blue green yellow green green green red
4. lug walm zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow red
5. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red

Checking the pattern, ""walm"" appears to replicate the last color word before it. Let’s apply this rule and see if it fits each example:

1. lug zup dax walm
   Before ""walm"" the color is green and after ""walm"" the output is green green green, which fits our potential rule.

2. wif walm dax
   Before ""walm,"" the color is red and after ""walm,"" the output sequence is red red, indicating ""walm"" stands for ""red"" repeated once, consistent with our rule.

3. lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Before ""walm,"" the color is green and after ""walm,"" the sequence is green green, which aligns with the deduced rule.

4. lug walm zup wif
   Before ""walm,"" the color is blue and after ""walm,"" the output sequence is blue blue, following the rule.

5. dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Before ""walm,"" the last color word is ""red"" and after ""walm"" the sequence is red red, again fitting the potential rule.

Thus, from these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"":

"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we look for patterns in the examples provided:

1. When ""zup"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output color associated with ""bluf"" is yellow.

   - ""zup bluf lug zup"" -> yellow yellow blue yellow
   - ""zup bluf"" -> yellow yellow

2. When ""dax"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output color associated with ""bluf"" is green.
   - ""dax zup bluf"" -> green yellow yellow
   - ""dax bluf zup"" -> green green yellow

3. ""bluf"" is never the first word, so we cannot determine its color without a preceding word. 

4. The color associated with ""bluf"" does not seem to be affected by any words following it but only by the word directly before it.

From these patterns, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" is dependent on the word immediately preceding it. If ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output color for ""bluf"" is yellow. If ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output color for ""bluf"" is green.

Therefore: bluf -> If preceded by ""zup,"" bluf means yellow; if preceded by ""dax,"" bluf means green.",1.0,198,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to identify patterns in the provided examples that allow us to relate the input to the corresponding output. Examining the sequences given, a pattern emerges when we consider the position of ""bluf"" in relation to the other words, ""zup"" and ""dax,"" and their associated colors.

Considering the examples provided:

- ""zup dax bluf"" translates to ""yellow green green."" Here ""bluf"" seems to produce ""green"" which is the color associated with ""dax"" which precedes it.
- ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow."" Here ""bluf"" produces ""yellow,"" – the color associated with ""zup,"" which is the word that preceded it.
- ""zup bluf lug zup"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue yellow."" In this sequence, ""bluf"" produces ""yellow,"" the color associated with ""zup,"" the word right before it.
- ""dax bluf zup"" translates to ""green green yellow."" Here again, ""bluf"" produces the color ""green,"" which corresponds to ""dax,"" the word before it.
- ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow."" And again, ""bluf"" yields ""yellow,"" which is associated with ""zup"" that comes right before it.

From these observations, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. If ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color is ""yellow."" If ""dax"" precedes it, the color is ""green."" 

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.",1.0,198,bluf
"bluf -> yellow when following ""zup"", green when following ""dax"". Rule: The color output for ""bluf"" depends on the preceding word: ""yellow"" follows ""zup,"" and ""green"" follows ""dax"". If ""bluf"" is the last word or if there is no context provided for a preceding word, the default color appears to be yellow.",1.0,198,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" I need to analyze the patterns associated with the word in the given examples. Let's examine the context in which ""bluf"" appears and the corresponding color outputs.

1. When ""bluf"" appears after ""zup,"" the resulting color is yellow:
   - zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
   - zup bluf lug zup -> yellow yellow blue yellow
   - zup bluf -> yellow yellow

2. When ""bluf"" appears after ""dax,"" the resulting color is green:
   - dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
   - dax bluf zup -> green green yellow

Looking at these examples, the rule seems to be tied to the word that precedes ""bluf"":

- If ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output color is yellow.
- If ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output color is green.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it takes the color of the word that comes before it:

bluf -> meaning: The color output is the same as the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""bluf.""

Rule: ""bluf"" mimics the color of the preceding word. If ""zup"" (which corresponds to yellow) comes before ""bluf,"" the output is yellow. If ""dax"" (which corresponds to green) comes before ""bluf,"" the output is green.",1.0,198,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, ""bluf"" corresponds to a color, but its exact value changes depending on its position relative to other words in the input. Here's the analysis:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", the output color is green.
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the output color is yellow.
3. When ""bluf"" is between ""zup"" and ""lug"", the output color is blue.
4. When ""bluf"" precedes ""zup"", the output color is also yellow.

So the rule seems to depend on the word that comes before ""bluf"", as follows:

- If ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"", the color is yellow.
- If ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"", the color is green.
- If ""bluf"" is between ""zup"" and another word (as seen with ""lug""), it is blue.

As we do not have examples of ""bluf"" coming at the beginning or end of a string without a preceding word, nor examples of ""bluf"" after words other than ""dax"" or ""zup"", we can only infer the rule based on the given words.

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" is determined by the word that comes directly before it. If preceded by ""zup"", the meaning is yellow. If preceded by ""dax"", the meaning is green. If it is between ""zup"" and another word, the meaning is blue.",0.9,198,bluf
"Based on the examples given, each utterance of a word corresponds to a color, with ""walm"" resulting in a repetition of a color. The specific rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color associated with the word before it a number of times equal to the number of letters in the word that precedes ""walm."" To break down each example:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue."" ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and since ""lug"" has three letters, ""walm"" repeats the word ""blue"" three times.
- ""wif lug walm"" outputs ""red blue blue blue."" ""Wif"" is ""red"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" Since ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and has three letters, ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- ""wif walm"" gives ""red red red."" Here, ""wif"" is the word before ""walm"" and it has three letters, so ""red"" is repeated three times.
- ""lug walm zup wif"" turns into ""blue blue blue yellow red."" ""Lug"" is before ""walm,"" so ""blue"" is repeated three times. ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red"" (these words are not followed by ""walm,"" so there's no repetition).
- ""dax wif walm"" results in ""green red red red."" ""Dax"" is associated with ""green,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" and ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which has three letters, hence ""red"" is repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the preceding color word to be repeated a number of times equal to the number of letters in the preceding word.",1.0,198,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we must look for patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Input: lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue
Input: wif lug walm -> Output: red blue blue blue
Input: wif walm -> Output: red red red
Input: lug walm zup wif -> Output: blue blue blue yellow red
Input: dax wif walm -> Output: green red red red

Based on the examples:

- When we see “lug walm”, “blue” is repeated three times.
- “wif lug walm"" results in one “red” followed by “blue” being repeated three times.
- When we see “wif walm”, “red” is repeated three times.
- For “lug walm zup wif”, ""blue"" is repeated three times, then follows a pattern for the words ""zup"" and ""wif"" which are ""yellow"" and ""red"" respectively.
- “dax wif walm” leads to “green” followed by “red” being repeated three times.

The pattern indicates that the word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it, repeating three times. It should be noted that ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" ""wif"" results in ""red,"" ""dax"" results in ""green,"" and these colors are the ones being repeated three times after the word ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.",1.0,198,walm
"Based on the provided examples, each instance of the word ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here's the interpretation of the examples given:

- ""lug walm"" output is ""blue blue blue"". ""Lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"", and the presence of ""walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated three times.
- ""wif lug walm"" output is ""red blue blue blue"". ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"". ""Walm"" following ""lug"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times.
- ""wif walm"" output is ""red red red"". ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times.
- ""lug walm zup wif"" output is ""blue blue blue yellow red"". ""Walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""wif"" to ""red"".
- ""dax wif walm"" output is ""green red red red"". ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times.

Hence, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.",1.0,198,walm
"The presence of the word ""walm"" in the inputs correlates with a repetition of a color in the outputs. Observing the number of times the color is repeated and the other words in the input, we can induce the following rules:

- The word immediately preceding ""walm"" seems to dictate the color that is repeated:
  - ""lug"" -> blue
  - ""wif"" -> red
  - ""dax"" -> green

- The number of times the color is repeated matches the number of times ""walm"" appears plus one. For instance, in the input ""lug walm"", the output is ""blue blue blue"", indicating that the color blue is said once for ""lug"" and then twice more for the single occurrence of ""walm"".

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" can be stated as:

walm -> Repeat the color indicated by the preceding word one additional time for each occurrence of ""walm"".

Example: In the input ""lug walm"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and since ""walm"" follows, we repeat ""blue"" one extra time, resulting in ""blue blue blue"".
",0.8,198,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at each of the examples and the corresponding outputs:

1. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
2. ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue""
3. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
4. ""lug walm zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow red""
5. ""dax wif walm"" -> ""green red red red""

It appears that ""walm"" generates a repetition of the word that immediately precedes it in the input. For example, in the first input ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" generates two more instances of ""blue"" for a total of three ""blue."" Similarly, in the third input ""wif walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" generates two more ""red"" for a total of three ""red.""

Based on these observations, we can infer the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" in the input, three times in total.",0.8,198,walm

- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"".
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""walm"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"" when not preceded directly by ""dax"", but ""green"" when it is.

- ""dax"" appears to modify the color word following it to ""green"", or represents the color ""green"" when it stands alone.

Thus, we can induce the following rule:

"Given the examples provided, it seems that the language input is being translated into a series of English color words in the output, where each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in every output where it is used.

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" correlates with the output color ""red."" Each occurrence of ""wif"" in the input examples results in ""red"" appearing in the corresponding position in the output.

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" seems to change color to red. Every time ""wif"" is mentioned in the input, ""red"" is found in the output at the same position.

Here is how ""wif"" corresponds to the output in each provided example:

   Output: blue blue blue red blue
   The word ""wif"" produces ""red"" in the third position.

2. Input: zup walm wif

   The word ""wif"" produces ""red"" in the third position.

3. Input: wif lug

4. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup

4. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif

5. Input: zup dax bluf

In each example where ""zup"" appears, the output consistently includes the word ""yellow."" Regardless of the other words or their order, the presence of ""zup"" guarantees that ""yellow"" will appear in the output.

Based on these observations and the repeated pattern, we can deduce the following rule:

"Based on the examples provided, ""zup"" corresponds consistently with the word ""yellow."" Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output. Thus, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: bluf -> 'repeats the color word before it',0.8,199,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" can be deduced by looking at the words preceding it. After each occurrence of ""bluf,"" a certain pattern follows that involves the colors mentioned after ""bluf."" Here is the pattern observed:

1. In the first example (lug wif dax bluf wif lug), the colors that follow ""bluf"" are the reverse of the colors that come before it: red blue green -> green red blue.

2. In the second example (dax zup bluf), there is a doubling of the color that precedes ""bluf"": green yellow -> yellow.

3. In the third example (zup wif bluf zup lug), the pattern surrounding ""bluf"" involves reversing the sequence before ""bluf"" and then adding the first color of the sequence at the end: red yellow -> red yellow blue.

4. In the fourth example (zup dax zup dax wif bluf), the presence of ""bluf"" indicates a doubling of the entire sequence before it: yellow green yellow green -> red.

5. In the fifth example (wif zup bluf lug), ""bluf"" is followed by a repetition of the second color before ""bluf"" and then the first color: red yellow -> yellow blue.

From these patterns, we can deduce that ""bluf"" triggers a transformation of the sequence that precedes it. The exact transformation seems to depend on the specific position and context of the words that come before ""bluf."" However, the transformation rule is not entirely clear, as we see doubling, reversing, and appending. Without additional examples to isolate the effects of ""bluf,"" any deduction would be speculative.

Given these observations, we cannot establish a consistent rule for ""bluf"" beyond noting that it prompts a transformation of the preceding sequence of colors. Therefore, the best we can currently say is:

Rule: bluf -> red,0.0,199,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided. Each example contains the word ""walm"" and a sequence of colors in the output. I will analyze the position of ""walm"" in each input as well as the colors that follow it in the output to find a rule.

Examining the inputs alongside their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue
   - ""dax"" correlates with the first green, ""walm"" seems to correlate with the following green colors, and ""lug"" correlates with blue.

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" correlates with yellow, and ""walm"" seems to correlate with the following yellow colors.

3. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" correlates with yellow, ""wif"" with the first red, and ""walm"" with the following red colors.

4. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   - Following the previous pattern, ""zup"" correlates with yellow, ""wif"" with red, ""dax"" with green, and ""walm"" again seems to be associated with a continuation of the color that precedes it, followed by ""lug"" which is always blue.

5. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red
   - The pattern holds with ""zup,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug."" However, ""walm"" comes before ""lug"" and after ""dax,"" and the color green continues. ""wif"" is at the end and corresponds to red.

From this, we can deduce a tentative rule for ""walm"":
- ""walm"" seems to indicate a repeating sequence of the color word that immediately precedes it, up until either the sentence ends or a new color word is introduced.

Rule: walm -> continue the preceding color in sequence until a new color name appears or the sequence ends.",1.0,199,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" means the repetition of the color corresponding to the word right before ""walm"", as many times as there are unique colors present in the input before ""walm"", followed by the color corresponding to the word right after ""walm"" if there is one.

Explanation:
- In the first input ""dax walm lug"", ""dax"" corresponds to green, and there is only one color (green) before ""walm."" Therefore, ""walm"" means ""green"" repeated one time (the number of unique colors present), followed by ""blue"" which corresponds to ""lug.""
   Output: green green green blue

- In the second input ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and since it is the only color before ""walm,"" ""walm"" means three yellows.
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

- In the third input ""zup wif walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""wif"" corresponds to red. There are two unique colors present, so ""walm"" produces ""red"" repeated two times followed by another ""red.""
   Output: yellow red red red

- In the fourth input ""zup wif dax walm lug,"" the unique colors before ""walm"" are yellow, red, and green; therefore, ""walm"" results in ""green"" repeated three times, followed by ""blue"" which corresponds to ""lug.""
   Output: yellow red green green green blue

- In the fifth input ""zup dax walm lug wif,"" there are two unique colors before ""walm"" (yellow and green), so ""walm"" gives ""green"" repeated two times, followed by ""blue,"" and then ""red"" corresponding to ""wif"" appears at the end outside of the repetition pattern.
   Output: yellow green green green blue red

Therefore, the rule can be formulated as ""walm"" repeats the color of the word right before it a number of times equal to the number of unique colors present before it, and then appends the color of the word proceeding it if there is one.",1.0,199,walm
"Rule: ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the color indicated by the word before it; if followed by the word ""lug"", it adds ""blue"" at the end. For example:
- In ""dax walm lug"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""walm"" causes it to repeat three times followed by ""lug"" which appends ""blue"".
- In ""zup walm"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" causes it to repeat three times.
- In ""zup wif walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""walm"" causes it to repeat three times.
- In ""zup wif dax walm lug"", ""walm"" causes ""green"" to repeat three times followed by ""blue"" because ""lug"" comes after ""walm"".
- In ""zup dax walm lug wif"", ""walm"" causes ""green"" to repeat three times with ""blue"" following since ""lug"" comes after ""walm"" and ""wif"" at the end stands alone corresponding to ""red"".

walm -> triggers the repetition of the previous color three times, and if followed by ""lug"", also appends ""blue"".",1.0,199,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to influence the output pattern in the following way:

- It initiates a repetition of the color mapped from the word that immediately precedes ""walm.""
- The number of times the color repeats corresponds to the number of letters in the word preceding ""walm.""
- If no word precedes ""walm,"" it does not output any color, as there is no example of ""walm"" occurring at the beginning of an input sequence.

Let's break it down:

1. ""dax walm lug"" -> ""green green green blue""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""walm"" causes ""green"" to repeat three times because ""dax"" has three letters.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

2. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to repeat three times because ""zup"" has three letters.

3. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""walm"" causes ""red"" to repeat three times because ""wif"" has three letters.

4. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" -> ""yellow red green green green blue""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""walm"" causes ""green"" to repeat three times because ""dax"" has three letters.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

5. ""zup dax walm lug wif"" -> ""yellow green green green blue red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""walm"" causes ""green"" to repeat three times because ""dax"" has three letters.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Given the patterns observed, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" appears in the input, it causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word. The number of repetitions is equal to the number of letters in the word preceding ""walm.""

Therefore:

walm -> cause the repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes ""walm,"" with the number of repetitions equal to the number of letters in the preceding word.",1.0,199,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the inputs and outputs provided:

1. Input: ""dax walm lug"" -> Output: ""green green green blue""
2. Input: ""zup walm"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
3. Input: ""zup wif walm"" -> Output: ""yellow red red red""
4. Input: ""zup wif dax walm lug"" -> Output: ""yellow red green green green blue""
5. Input: ""zup dax walm lug wif"" -> Output: ""yellow green green green blue red""

If we observe the color sequences generated and relate them to the presence of ""walm"" in the input, we can try to infer the rule associated with ""walm"":

- ""dax walm lug"" correlates with ""green green green blue."" Notice ""dax"" appears with ""green"" prior to ""walm"" and ""lug"" appears as ""blue"" after ""walm.""
- ""zup walm"" correlates with ""yellow yellow yellow."" The color sequence consists of three ""yellow,"" with ""zup"" known to correlate with ""yellow"" in other examples.
- ""zup wif walm"" correlates with ""yellow red red red."" ""Wif"" introduces a ""red"" and ""walm"" seems to maintain the ""red"" sequence.
- ""zup wif dax walm lug"" correlates with ""yellow red green green green blue."" Confirming that ""dax"" leads to ""green"" and ""lug"" after ""walm"" leads to ""blue.""
- ""zup dax walm lug wif"" correlates with ""yellow green green green blue red."" Here ""dax"" again brings ""green"" before ""walm,"" ""lug"" brings ""blue"" after ""walm,"" and ""wif"" contributes ""red"" at the end.

It appears that ""walm"" functions as a connector that causes the output to continue the sequence of the color that appears before it. If no color is before it (as associated with a preceding word), it defaults to repeating the color corresponding to the word coming directly before it. If there is no word before ""walm,"" it looks for a word after it and repeats the color associated with that next word.

Thus, we can suggest the following rule:

Rule: walm -> repeats the color associated with the preceding word. If there's a word after it and not before it, repeat the color associated with the following word. If positioned between two words, it repeats the color associated with the preceding word.

This rule would explain the outputs given the inputs provided. However, due to the limited data, this inferred rule may not be entirely exhaustive or cover all possible uses of ""walm"" in different contexts.",0.9,199,walm
