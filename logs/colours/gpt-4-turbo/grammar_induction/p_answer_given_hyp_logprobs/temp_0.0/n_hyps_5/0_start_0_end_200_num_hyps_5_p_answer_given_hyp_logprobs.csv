"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, we can induce that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each instance of ""dax"" is translated to ""green"" in every output. Other context words like ""wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""bluf"" seem to correspond to other colors.

Here's the breakdown:

- In every example where ""dax"" is present, ""green"" is included in the output.
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" as seen in the first and last examples.
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" in the last example and ""green"" when it occurs after ""dax.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" as seen in examples three and four, where its position affects the order of colors but not the association of the colors themselves.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding output. Therefore, we can deduce the meaning of ""wif"" as follows:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, it is translated to the color ""red"" in the output.
zup -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, ""zup"" consistently translates to the color yellow, regardless of the context or the other words accompanying it.

Rule: zup corresponds to the color yellow.
Rule: bluf -> blue
Analyzing the given examples, we need to deduce the meaning of the nonce word 'walm' based on the input and output sequences provided.

Let's compare each input with its corresponding output to look for patterns:

1. Input: `zup wif walm lug`
   Output: `yellow red red red blue`
   
2. Input: `wif walm dax zup`
   Output: `red red red green yellow`
   
3. Input: `zup walm`
   Output: `yellow yellow yellow`
   
4. Input: `zup bluf wif walm`
   Output: `yellow yellow red red red`
   
5. Input: `wif walm lug bluf`
   Output: `red red red blue blue`

From these examples it seems that the appearance of 'walm' in the input always results in a sequence of three reds in the output. Additionally, 'zup' corresponds to yellow and 'bluf' to blue, irrespective of the position in the sequence.

The other words like 'lug' and 'dax' correspond to blue and green, but they do not seem to be directly related to the meaning of 'walm.' 'Walm' appears to add reds in a consistent pattern irrespective of the position or the context of the surrounding words.

Based on this information, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: 'walm' corresponds to a sequence of three red in the output.

Therefore:

walm -> red red red

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax
    ",Output: red green,red green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To figure out the meaning of the word ""lug,"" let's analyze the patterns in the examples provided:

1. lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow  
2. dax lug zup dax -> green blue yellow green  
3. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow  
4. lug walm zup walm -> blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow  
5. lug dax -> blue green  

We can see that after the word ""lug,"" the output always starts with ""blue."" In the first example, none of the words after ""lug"" are repeated, and ""blue"" is followed by a sequence of different colors. In the fourth example, ""walm"" is repeated after ""lug,"" and each occurrence of ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue."" This suggests that ""lug"" triggers the color ""blue"" for the subsequent word, regardless of what that word is. The difference is, when a word repeats immediately after ""lug,"" ""blue"" is repeated for as many times as the word itself is repeated.

Based on the above observations, the rule for ""lug"" could be stated as:

Rule: Every time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it is followed by ""blue"" in the output. If the next word repeats, ""blue"" is repeated for each instance of that word.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

- Every instance of ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green"" in the Output.
- ""dax"" appears to be a standalone element that translates directly to ""green"" regardless of its position in the Input string.

Therefore, the rule we can infer is:

dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in all provided contexts.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule is as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to a specific color output. Each example where ""zup"" is present results in the word ""yellow"" appearing in the output. No other word in the examples provided consistently corresponds to this color in the output.

Thus, the rule for ""zup"" appears to be straightforward:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> red
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's first identify the unique elements of each input and their corresponding outputs:

1. `dax walm wif walm zup`
   - Output: green green green red red red yellow
   - `dax` corresponds to a single ""green,"" `zup` corresponds to a single ""yellow,"" while ""walm"" appears twice before ""wif"" and once at the end.
    
2. `zup bluf wif walm`
   - Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - `zup` starts with ""yellow,"" and `bluf` does not appear in the first example, but shows up here as ""yellow.""
    
3. `wif walm`
   - Output: red red red
   - `wif` appears in all examples but consistently produces ""red.""
    
4. `wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif`
   - Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   - `lug` is new and produces ""blue,"" which means ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" In previous examples, ""wif"" is always ""red,"" and ""dax"" is always ""green.""
   
5. `dax lug walm`
   - Output: green blue blue blue
   - Here, `lug` is followed by ""walm,"" which results in three ""blue"" outputs, a deviation from its previous association with a single ""blue.""

Noticing a pattern from the examples:

- ""walm"" consistently results in a repeated color output after it, and the number of repetitions corresponds to the number of times ""walm"" appears in the sequence.
- The color that is repeated is the color associated with the word that directly follows ""walm.""

From the given data:

- In the first example, after each ""walm,"" ""wif"" follows and ""red"" is repeated three times.
- In the second example, after ""walm"" there's no word, but the output is three ""red,"" and ""wif"" was just before ""walm,"" suggesting that ""walm"" is repeating the color of ""wif.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and we again see ""red"" repeated three times.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" which results in a repetition of ""blue"" three times after ""walm.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" follows ""dax,"" but ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, making it difficult to determine the rule since nothing follows ""walm.""

Based on these observations, it appears ""walm"" is a modifier that repeats the color output of the following word by three times.

Rule: walm -> A modifier that repeats the color of the word that follows it three times. If no word follows it, it repeats the color of the word preceding it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup
    ",Output: red yellow,red yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. The meaning appears to be ""blue.""

Rule: Whenever you see the word ""lug"" in the input, it translates to ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> meaning. Given the examples, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green."" Whether it appears alone or with other words, ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green"" in the output. The accompanying words (lug, wif, zup) have outputs unrelated to ""dax"" as they correspond to other colors (blue, red, yellow).

Rule: ""dax"" means ""green.""
Observing the pattern from the given examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze the patterns and correlations in the input and output examples.

1. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   
2. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red
   
3. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow
   
4. Input: dax zup lug bluf
   Output: green yellow blue blue
   
5. Input: dax bluf zup
   Output: green green yellow
   
Observing the outputs corresponding to the inputs with ""zup,"" it looks like ""zup"" always results in a ""yellow"" in the output. By looking at each instance:

- In examples 1 and 3, every time ""zup"" appears, there is a ""yellow"" right after the ""red"" or ""blue"" associated with the word that directly precedes it.

- In examples 2, 4, and 5, each time we see ""zup,"" it directly translates to ""yellow,"" regardless of the word that comes after.

Based on the patterns observed in the examples, it seems that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" consistently regardless of its position or the surrounding words.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green red.""
- When ""bluf"" is between ""zup"" and ""lug,"" the output is ""yellow blue.""
- When ""bluf"" immediately follows just ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and is before ""lug"" or ""dax,"" the output is ""red red.""

It appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the word ""red"" consistently across these examples, regardless of its position in the input. This can be corroborated by noticing that every time the word ""bluf"" appears, the word ""red"" also appears in the output. Therefore, we can infer that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red"".

Rule: bluf -> red.
walm -> repeating the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, it takes on the meaning of repeating the color associated with that preceding word three times. For instance, ""dax"" is associated with the color green, so ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green."" Similarly, ""lug"" is associated with the color blue, so ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue."" For ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" is associated with yellow, making the output ""yellow yellow yellow.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to observe the patterns in the provided inputs and outputs:

Input: dax wif
Output: green red
- ""dax"" is followed by ""green.""

Input: dax
Output: green
- Alone, ""dax"" leads to ""green.""

Input: dax wif lug dax
Output: green red blue green
- The second occurrence of ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green.""

Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
Output: blue red green green red blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" within a sequence.

Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
Output: red green red red yellow red
- ""dax"" is between two ""wif"" and corresponds to ""green.""

Based on this analysis:

Rule: dax -> green

The meaning of ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in each output irrespective of its position or the surrounding words.
Based on the given examples, the operation seems consistent irrespective of the context. The word 'wif' consistently translates to the color 'red' in the output. There is no variation in this pattern across the provided examples.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the word ""zup"" by examining its context and corresponding outputs:

- In the first example, every instance of ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the words that follow.
- In the second example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when it appears after ""wif"".
- In the third example, ""zup"" standing alone corresponds to ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" followed by ""lug"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and then the corresponding colors for ""lug"" and ""dax"" follow.
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" followed by ""bluf wif walm"" still corresponds to ""yellow"", and then the sequence of colors that follow are for ""bluf,"" ""wif,"" and ""walm.""

From these observations, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" irrespective of its position or surrounding words.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the provided input-output pairs, I will analyze each example to deduce the meaning of the word 'bluf':

1. Input: zup bluf | Output: yellow yellow
2. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf | Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
3. Input: lug bluf wif | Output: blue blue red
4. Input: zup bluf | Output: yellow yellow
5. Input: zup bluf lug dax lug | Output: yellow yellow blue green blue

Let's consider the word 'bluf' in each context:

- In the first and fourth examples, 'bluf' follows 'zup,' and the output is 'yellow yellow,' suggesting that 'bluf' might translate to 'yellow' in this context.
  
- In the second example, 'bluf' appears after 'lug walm wif lug.' The output sequence is 'blue blue blue red blue blue,' where the word right before the last 'blue' is 'bluf,' which is consistent with 'bluf' meaning 'blue' if we consider the repetition of 'lug.'

- In the third example, 'bluf' follows 'lug,' and precedes 'wif' with outputs 'blue blue red,' which again, if we follow the repetition pattern, indicates that 'bluf' might mean 'blue.'

- In the fifth example, 'bluf' is between 'zup' and 'lug,' and the output contains 'yellow yellow' before the 'blue,' which follows our pattern from the previous analysis.

Given that 'bluf' translates to 'yellow' when directly following 'zup' and to 'blue' in other contexts, we can infer that the meaning of 'bluf' is context-dependent and linked to the word that precedes it.

However, since there is not enough variation in the examples to definitively determine the complete set of rules governing 'bluf,' the best rule we can deduce from this limited dataset is that:

Rule: 'bluf' means ""blue"" unless it directly follows ""zup,"" in which case it means ""yellow."" 

bluf -> ""blue"" (general case), ""yellow"" (when following ""zup"")
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's compare each input with its corresponding output:

1. ""wif lug walm"" produces ""red blue blue blue"" - The word ""walm"" is used at the end of a three-word phrase and results in three repeats of a color.

2. ""dax wif walm"" produces ""green red red red"" - Here, ""walm"" follows two words and the output is three repeats of the second word's corresponding color.

3. ""dax walm"" produces ""green green green"" - ""walm"" follows one word, repeating its corresponding color three times.

4. ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow"" - As above, the color corresponding to the first word is repeated three times.

5. ""dax walm"" (repeated) also produces ""green green green"" - Consistently with previous examples, the usage of ""walm"" repeats the preceding word's color.

Given the consistency across examples, we can induce that ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word. If the preceding word is ""wif,"" the color is red; if it's ""dax,"" the color is green; and if it's ""zup,"" the color is yellow. ""Walm"" doesn't have a color itself, but rather modifies the output to repeat the color linked to the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax bluf
    ",Output: red green blue,red green green,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" is present in the corresponding position in the output. 

Here is how the rule applies in each example:

Input: wif lug wif -> Output: red blue red (""wif"" corresponds to ""red"")
Input: lug wif bluf -> Output: blue red red (""wif"" corresponds to ""red"")
Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red (""wif"" corresponds to ""red"")
Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup -> Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow (""wif"" corresponds to ""red"")
Input: wif dax zup dax -> Output: red green yellow green (""wif"" corresponds to ""red"")

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the limited examples provided, when the input 'zup' is seen, the consistent output is 'yellow'. Regardless of placement within the input sequence or the presence of other words, 'zup' always corresponds to 'yellow'. 

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word 'zup' translates to the color 'yellow'.
Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to connect the nonce word ""bluf"" with a color output in the ""Output"" sequence. Here is the analysis of each example:

1. Input: wif zup bluf
   Output: red yellow yellow
   - Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" is repeated as ""yellow"".

2. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   - In this case, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" again results in ""yellow"" output.

3. Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
   Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
   - We have ""zup"" leading to ""yellow"", ""bluf"" resulting in ""yellow"", ""dax"" producing ""green"", ""lug"" resulting in ""blue"", and the sequence repeats with ""bluf"" resulting in ""blue"". This suggests that ""bluf"" in this context reflects the color of the word that follows it.

4. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   - ""wif"" results in ""red"", and ""bluf"" also results in ""red"".

5. Input: wif bluf lug dax wif
   Output: red red blue green red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""bluf"" results in ""red"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and finally ""wif"" again to ""red"".

Combining these analyses, it seems that the word ""bluf"" could represent a rule where it takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it. In cases where ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" it takes on the color ""red""; when preceded by ""zup,"" it becomes ""yellow"". However, in example 3, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" and ""lug"", resulting in ""blue"" and ""green"", respectively. This observation seems to contradict the earlier deduction. But if we consider that the meaning of ""bluf"" changes when it is followed by another word and that it reflects the color of the word that follows it rather than precedes it, this would explain why ""bluf"" represents ""blue"" since ""lug"" (blue) comes right after it.

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" could be that it represents the color of the word following it, except when it is the last word in the sequence, in which case it takes the color of the word preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the next word, or if it is the last word, the color of the previous word.
Upon examining the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can infer that the position of ""walm"" in the sequence relates to the colors that follow it. Notably:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears, the subsequent colors in the sequence are repeated three times except when ""walm"" is at the end of the input sequence. In such case, ""walm"" influences the repetition of the last color mention before it.

For instance:
- In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" which corresponds to red, resulting in ""green green green red.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" comes after the word ""wif"" which corresponds to red, so we again have ""red red red"" following ""walm.""
- In the third, fourth, and fifth examples, ""lug"" comes before ""walm"" and corresponds to blue, so we observe ""blue blue blue"" after ""walm.""

The rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to repeat three times in the output, except if ""walm"" is the final word, in which case it causes the preceding color to repeat until the end of the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
Rule: dax -> green

This rule induction suggests that the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in every instance it appears in the input.
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
Based on the provided examples, zup consistently translates to the color yellow regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" is associated with the color \textbf{red} appearing once if preceded by ""wif"", and \textbf{doubling} the most recently mentioned color if not preceded by ""wif"". Here are the rules deduced from the provided examples:

- When ""bluf"" follows the word ""wif"", the output is ""red"" regardless of the preceding color.
- When ""bluf"" does not follow the word ""wif"", the output is the immediate preceding color repeated.

Let's confirm this with the examples given:

Input: dax lug bluf dax
Output: green blue blue green
Rule: ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (not ""wif""), so it repeats the color immediately before it, which is blue.

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
Rule: ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", so the output is red regardless of the preceding color. Because ""bluf"" is the word triggering this rule, the red is repeated.

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
Rule: ""bluf"" does not follow ""wif"", so the output is the color immediately before it, repeated.

Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
Output: green yellow red red blue
Rule: ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", so the output is red repeated.

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red
Rule: Again, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", resulting in red repeated.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is as follows:

Rule: bluf -> When preceded by ""wif"", output is ""red red"". When not preceded by ""wif"", repeat the most recent color mentioned.
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" appears to have an effect on the color output associated with it. Let's analyze each example to deduce the rule:

1. zup walm wif
   - Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   - Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and ""wif"" follows ""walm."" After ""walm,"" we see that ""yellow"" is repeated thrice before changing to ""red"" associated with ""wif.""

2. lug walm
   - Output: blue blue blue
   - ""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the color ""blue"" (associated with ""lug"") is repeated three times.

3. wif walm dax
   - Output: red red red green
   - ""Walm"" follows ""wif,"" and ""red"" is repeated three times before changing to ""green"" associated with ""dax.""

4. wif lug dax walm
   - Output: red blue green green green
   - ""Walm"" comes after ""dax."" Following ""walm,"" the color ""green"" is repeated three times.

5. wif walm zup lug zup walm
   - Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - The first ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" resulting in ""red"" repeated three times. The second ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" resulting in ""yellow"" repeated three times.

Based on these observations, ""walm"" seems to cause the color word before it to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the given examples. Each occurrence of ""lug"" is translated to ""blue,"" irrespective of its position in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". Each instance where ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, ""green"" appears in the respective output. The correspondence is consistent across all given examples, regardless of the other words (e.g., ""lug,"" ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" ""zup"") present.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" When ""wif"" is present, the output includes ""red."" 

Here's how it lines up with the examples:

- Input: ""wif walm"" Output: ""red red red"" → ""wif"" correlates with the first ""red,"" and potentially ""walm"" correlates with the subsequent ""red red.""
  
- Input: ""wif zup lug"" Output: ""red yellow blue"" → ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" with ""blue.""
  
- Input: ""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax"" Output: ""red blue blue yellow yellow green"" → ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" ""bluf"" with ""blue/yellow,"" ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" with ""green.""

- Input: ""wif dax zup bluf"" Output: ""red green yellow yellow"" → ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" with ""yellow.""

- Input: ""dax wif bluf"" Output: ""green red red"" → ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" and ""bluf"" potentially with ""red"" (assuming repetition from the first example or an unknown pattern not fully revealed in this particular example).

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word 'zup' by comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs:

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
Rule Observed: 'zup' translates to 'yellow', and 'walm' repeats the 'yellow'.

Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
Output: green green red blue yellow
Rule Observed: 'dax' translates to 'green', 'bluf' to 'green', 'wif' to 'red', 'lug' to 'blue', and 'zup' at the end translates to 'yellow'.

Input: dax walm zup lug dax
Output: green green green yellow blue green
Rule Observed: 'dax' translates to 'green', 'walm' to 'green', 'zup' to 'yellow', 'lug' to 'blue', and the last 'dax' again to 'green'.

Input: dax wif zup
Output: green red yellow
Rule Observed: 'dax' translates to 'green', 'wif' to 'red', and 'zup' to 'yellow'.

Input: zup wif dax walm lug
Output: yellow red green green green blue
Rule Observed: 'zup' translates to 'yellow', 'wif' to 'red', 'dax' to 'green', 'walm' leads to a repetition of 'green', and 'lug' to 'blue'.

Based on these observations, the term 'zup' consistently translates to the color 'yellow' regardless of its position in the sequence.

Conclusion:
zup -> 'yellow'
Based on the provided examples, we can infer that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to a specific color in the output. To determine the exact meaning, let's analyze each example and identify the pattern:

- Input: zup bluf wif bluf -> Output: yellow yellow red red
  - Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" when following ""zup"" and ""wif"".

- Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup -> Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
  - In this sequence, ""bluf"" is again ""red"" following ""zup"".

- Input: wif bluf lug -> Output: red red blue
  - ""bluf"" is again ""red"" following ""wif"", but note the pair ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" at the end.

- Input: zup bluf wif dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow red green blue
  - Once more, ""bluf"" following ""zup"" is ""red"".

- Input: lug dax bluf -> Output: blue green green
  - In this example, the position following ""lug dax"" does not seem to match the previous pattern for ""bluf"". Instead, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" here.

From the examples given, we can see that ""bluf"" usually translates to ""red"" when it follows ""zup"" or ""wif"". However, in the last example where it follows the sequence ""lug dax,"" it translates to ""green"". With this inconsistency, it suggests that the word ""bluf"" has a conditional meaning based on the preceding word or sequence of words.

Given that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" when preceded by ""zup"" or ""wif"" and corresponds to ""green"" when preceded by ""lug dax"", the general rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on different meanings depending on the context provided by the preceding words.

Rule: ""bluf"" means ""red"" after ""zup"" or ""wif"", but can change meaning if preceded by a different set of words, as with ""lug dax"" where it means ""green"".
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to cause the repetition of the color that comes before it. The color repeats for as many words as follow ""walm,"" including ""walm"" itself. 

Rule: walm -> causes the color preceding it to repeat for each word following, including itself.

Let's validate this rule with the given examples:

1. zup dax lug walm zup lug
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and after ""walm"" there are two more words, so ""blue"" is repeated two times for ""walm"" and ""zup.""

2. zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and there is one ""walm,"" thus yellow is repeated for both ""zup"" and ""walm.""

3. zup lug walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and there is one word ""walm"" following it, so ""blue"" is repeated once for ""walm.""

4. zup walm lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and there are two words ""walm"" and ""lug"" following it, hence ""yellow"" is repeated twice for ""walm"" and ""lug"" is blue.

5. wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and there is one ""walm"" following it, so ""blue"" is repeated once for ""walm.""

Thus, given these examples, the rule for ""walm"" is validated.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
dax -> green

Rule: The input word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output color ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> red, Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" when translated.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the corresponding outputs for each given input that contains the word ""walm.""

- Input: zup wif dax walm -> Output: yellow red green green green
- Input: zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red
- Input: zup dax walm zup wif -> Output: yellow green green green yellow red
- Input: lug zup dax walm -> Output: blue yellow green green green
- Input: wif dax zup walm -> Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

From these examples, we can try to infer the rule for what ""walm"" represents. In each case, the word ""walm"" generates multiple occurrences of the color immediately preceding it. The number of repetitions of the color seems to be one more than the position of ""walm"" in the input sentence (counting from zero).

Here are the patterns we observe:

1. When ""walm"" is the fourth word in the input, the preceding color appears thrice in the output (since the index starts from 0, the position is 3). Examples:
   - ""zup wif dax walm"" -> ""yellow red green green green"" (Here ""walm"" is preceded by ""green"".)

2. When ""walm"" is the third word in the input, the preceding color appears three times in the output:
   - ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red"" (Here ""walm"" is preceded by ""red"".)

3. When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and is in the second position, we see two additional ""yellow"" after the ""walm"":
   - ""wif dax zup walm"" -> ""red green yellow yellow yellow"" (Here ""walm"" is preceded by ""yellow"".)

Based on these patterns, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" is a placeholder that causes the preceding color word to be repeated in the output (one more time than its index position).

Thus:

walm -> The rule is that ""walm"" duplicates the preceding color word in the output, repeating it one additional time beyond its index position in the input list.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm
    ",Output: blue blue blue,blue blue blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. 

Based on the provided examples, the word ""lug"" consistently results in the output ""blue,"" regardless of whether it is combined with other words like ""wif"" or ""dax."" The pattern indicates that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.

Rule: lug means blue.
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green

This rule is induced from the consistent output of ""green"" anytime the nonce word ""dax"" appears in the input. Each example where ""dax"" is mentioned corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

Examples supporting the rule:
1. Input: ""dax lug"" -> Output: ""green blue"" (dax corresponds to green)
2. Input: ""zup dax"" -> Output: ""yellow green"" (dax corresponds to green)
3. Input: ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" -> Output: ""blue blue blue green red blue red"" (dax corresponds to green)
4. Input: ""dax"" -> Output: ""green"" (dax corresponds to green alone)
5. Input: ""lug dax"" -> Output: ""blue green"" (dax corresponds to green)

In all instances, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input string, it consistently translates to ""green"". Therefore, it is clear that the rule for the meaning of ""dax"" is that it stands for the color ""green"".
Based on the provided examples, the output word associated with the nonce word 'wif' appears to be 'red' consistently. Whenever 'wif' appears as the input, the output is always 'red', regardless of the context of other words around it. Thus, the rule seems to be:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word 'wif' translates to the color 'red' in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" translates directly to the color ""yellow"" every time it is used. It seems to operate independently of the context, meaning that it does not matter what other words are around it; ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
From the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" directly translates to the color that precedes it.

Analyzing the inputs and outputs:

1. Input: zup bluf | Output: yellow yellow (bluf translates to yellow)
2. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug | Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue (bluf translates to yellow)
3. Input: wif dax bluf | Output: red green green (bluf translates to green)
4. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug | Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue (the first ""bluf"" translates to green and the second ""bluf"" translates to yellow)
5. Input: lug bluf | Output: blue blue (bluf translates to blue)

From these patterns, it appears that ""bluf"" is a placeholder for the last color word that appeared before it in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> the same color word that immediately precedes it.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to be a rule that instructs us to repeat the color associated with the word preceding ""walm"" three times. Let's analyze the patterns:

1. Input: dax lug wif walm -> Output: green blue red red red
   - The color red is repeated three times after ""wif,"" which precedes ""walm.""

2. Input: zup bluf wif walm -> Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - Again, the color red is repeated three times after ""wif"" before ""walm.""

3. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - This time, the color yellow is repeated three times after ""zup,"" which comes right before ""walm.""

4. Input: lug zup walm lug -> Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - Here, the color yellow is repeated three times after ""zup,"" which precedes ""walm.""

5. Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue
   - The color blue is repeated three times after ""lug,"" which is immediately before ""walm.""

Considering these examples, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup lug dax zup
    ",Output: yellow blue green yellow,yellow blue green yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding output.
Given the examples, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Every instance in the output where the word ""dax"" is used in the input, the word ""green"" is present in the output.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:
dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red
From the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or the rule associated with the nonce word ""zup.""

For each example input, when ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow."" There are no instances where ""zup"" results in a color other than ""yellow,"" so we can assume that it directly maps to this color. Therefore:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the examples given, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the word ""yellow"" except when it follows the word ""lug,"" in which case ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Examples to support this:
- ""zup bluf"" correlates with ""yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" means ""yellow.""
- When ""lug"" is placed before ""bluf"" (""lug bluf""), the output is ""blue blue,"" indicating that in this context ""bluf"" means ""blue.""
- In all other cases, regardless of the word that precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" could be stated as:
bluf -> ""yellow"" when not following ""lug,"" ""blue"" when directly following ""lug.""
Analyzing the examples provided, it seems that the presence of the nonce word ""walm"" affects the output colors that follow it. Here's a breakdown of each example and its output:

1. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   Analysis: The word ""walm"" follows a ""zup"" and all subsequent ""zup"" are yellow.

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Analysis: Again, the word ""walm"" followed by ""zup"" results in additional yellows.

3. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   Analysis: It seems that after ""walm"", ""lug"" is repeated but in blue, and ""wif"" is repeated but in red.

4. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   Analysis: The pattern of ""zup"" being yellow after ""walm"" is consistent; ""zup"" appears twice before ""walm"" and thrice in yellow after it.

5. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Analysis: After ""walm"", ""lug"" is again repeated blue thrice.

Rule: ""walm"" seems to cause the immediate previous word to be repeated three times in the color associated with that word. The colors associated with each word appear to be as follows:
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green

Hence, we can deduce:

walm -> Causes the immediate previous word to be outputted three more times in its corresponding color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup dax zup
    ",Output: red yellow green yellow,red yellow green yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of what other words are present. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

lug -> meaning. Rule: ""lug"" means ""blue"".
Analyzing the given examples, let's compare what changes when ""dax"" is present and what output it produces.

Input: dax zup walm wif walm
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red

Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

The commonality in the outputs when ""dax"" is present is the color green. So it seems that ""dax"" correlates to the color green in these outputs.

Let's test this hypothesis against more examples:

Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
Output: red red yellow red blue green

Here, ""dax"" is at the end after ""lug,"" and the output ends with green, which is consistent with our hypothesis.

Input: dax zup lug wif lug
Output: green yellow blue red blue

Green is at the beginning, corresponding with ""dax"" being the first word in the input.

Input: dax lug wif walm
Output: green blue red red red

Again, ""dax"" is the first word and the first color in the output is green.

From these examples, we can conclude:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by looking at its position and the corresponding output:

1. Input: zup wif zup 
   Output: yellow red yellow

2. Input: zup dax wif 
   Output: yellow green red

3. Input: dax wif lug dax 
   Output: green red blue green

4. Input: wif 
   Output: red

5. Input: dax zup dax zup wif 
   Output: green yellow green yellow red

When we look at the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can note the following:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the same position in the output.
- When ""wif"" is accompanied by other words like ""zup"" or ""dax,"" the outputs for these words are ""yellow"" and ""green,"" respectively, but ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red.""
- This pattern does not seem to depend on its position within the sequence, as it corresponds to ""red"" whether it's at the start, middle, or end of the input.

From these observations, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of context. Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule: bluf -> red if preceded by wif, blue if preceded by lug, yellow if it follows zup without any of those two conditions.
Examining the provided examples, a pattern can be discerned where ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here's how we can break it down:

1. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   ""wif"" results in ""red"", and ""walm"" results in a repetition of ""red"" once before moving on to the next word.

2. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
   ""lug"" results in ""blue"", and ""walm"" results in a repetition of ""blue"" before moving on to ""zup"".

3. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
   ""zup"" is ""yellow"", and ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"".

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   ""lug"" is ""blue"", and ""walm"" results in the repetition of ""blue"".

5. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   ""wif"" is ""red"", and ""walm"" repeats ""red"".

From these examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color word that precedes it to repeat. If ""walm"" is split between different color words, it doesn't split the effect; it applies the repeated color to the one immediately before it.

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". Every occurrence of ""dax"" results in the word ""green"" appearing in the output.

dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by looking at the pattern of the inputs and outputs.

Input: dax wif -> Output: green red
Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
Input: dax wif walm -> Output: green red red red
Input: dax wif bluf -> Output: green red red
Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red

From the first input ""dax wif"" and its output ""green red,"" we can see that ""dax"" maps to ""green"" and ""wif"" maps to ""red."" However, we need to analyze further because ""wif"" appears with other words in different examples.

The second input is ""wif lug,"" which outputs ""red blue."" Here, ""wif"" precedes ""lug,"" resulting in ""red blue,"" which suggests that ""lug"" could map to ""blue.""

The third input ""dax wif walm"" translates to ""green red red red."" Since we can already suspect ""dax"" means ""green,"" and ""wif"" means ""red,"" the repeated ""red red"" after ""wif"" suggests that ""walm"" might mean something that results in multiple ""reds.""

The fourth and fifth inputs, ""dax wif bluf"" and ""wif bluf,"" lead to ""green red red"" and ""red red,"" respectively. It indicates that ""bluf"" results in an additional ""red,"" similar to how “wif” also mapped to ""red.""

Considering these observations, it seems that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red,"" regardless of the context. Hence, the rule could be:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it seems that each specific word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in each example provided, regardless of the other words present.

Therefore, we can deduce the rule that:

zup -> yellow

Rule: ""zup"" means ""yellow"".
From the given examples, it can be deduced that ""bluf"" represents the color of the preceding word. Here is the analysis that supports this conclusion:

Input: dax lug wif bluf
Output: green blue red red
- Here, ""bluf"" is following ""wif"" and the corresponding color for ""wif"" is ""red"". Thus, ""bluf"" represents ""red"" in this context.

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red
- Again, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", and the translation is ""red"", reinforcing the pattern observed above.

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
- With only ""wif"" before ""bluf"" and both translating to ""red"", it's consistent with the previous examples.

Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green
- In this sequence, ""bluf"" first follows ""lug"" and translates to ""blue"", then it follows ""zup"" and translates to ""yellow"". This further strengthens the rule that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word.

Input: dax bluf zup
Output: green green yellow
- ""Bluf"" follows ""dax"" and translates to ""green"", then is not followed by a new input before ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color associated with the previous word in the sequence. If there is no previous word, ""bluf"" may not be applicable.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color indicated by the word immediately preceding it. Let's analyze the examples provided to determine the rule:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is three yellow colors, as ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. 
   
   Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

2. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is three green colors, as ""dax"" corresponds to green.

   Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red

3. When ""walm"" appears after ""zup,"" the output is again three yellow colors.

   Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

4. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is again three green colors.

   Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red

5. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is three blue colors, as ""lug"" corresponds to blue.

   Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> The color word immediately before ""walm"" is repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup lug dax
    ",Output: red yellow blue green,red yellow blue green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" consistently in all provided examples.
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following associations:

- When the input is ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""
- When other words are combined with ""wif"" (e.g., ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""walm""), they are associated with different colors: ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" and ""walm"" with ""yellow.""
- Multiple occurrences of the same word result in repeated colors in the output. For example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow.""

From these observations, it seems that each word is mapped to a particular color, and the word ""wif"" specifically is associated with the color ""red."" Thus, the rule appears to be a direct mapping of words to colors.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, we can start by mapping the known words to their output colors:

- ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green.""
- ""bluf"" consistently maps to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue.""
- ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red.""

When ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" always appears in the output, and it seems to be influenced by the context of the other words, given that its position in the output corresponds to its position in the input.

Let's go through the examples focusing on the occurrences of ""zup"":

1. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   Analysis: ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" ""bluf"" maps to ""yellow."" ""zup"" appears between them and maps to ""yellow.""

2. Input: lug walm zup
   Output: blue blue blue yellow
   Analysis: ""lug"" maps to ""blue."" ""walm"" is unknown, but is followed by ""blue."" ""zup"" is at the end and corresponds to ""yellow.""

3. Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
   Output: yellow red red yellow blue
   Analysis: ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" ""bluf"" maps to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" maps to ""blue."" ""zup"" appears at the beginning and before ""lug,"" mapping to ""yellow"" both times.

4. Input: dax zup lug wif zup
   Output: green yellow blue red yellow
   Analysis: Again, ""zup"" appears between known words, mapping to ""yellow.""

5. Input: dax zup lug wif lug
   Output: green yellow blue red blue
   Analysis: This is similar to example 4 but without the final ""zup.""

Given the consistent appearance of ""yellow"" for ""zup,"" but no discernible pattern related to the surrounding words influencing a change in ""zup's"" color, the rule appears to be simply:

Rule: ""zup"" maps to the color ""yellow.""
Rule: bluf -> red red

Explanation: In each example, whenever the word ""bluf"" appears, it is translated into ""red red"" in the output. The number of ""red"" occurrences following ""bluf"" is consistent across all examples, indicating that ""bluf"" corresponds specifically to a double occurrence of the color red.
Based on the examples provided and their corresponding outputs, we can try to deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm.""

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red

Input: zup dax lug walm zup
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

Input: zup lug walm wif dax
Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

In every instance where ""walm"" is used, it is followed by a color output that appears to be dependent on the word that ""walm"" follows. For example, when preceded by ""lug,"" ""walm"" results in ""blue blue."" When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" it results in ""green green.""

Additionally, when observing the position of ""walm,"" it always leads to a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it. ""Walm"" doesn't seem to have a color associated with it independently but instead copies the color of the word before it.

Hence the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> causes duplication of the color associated with the word before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".
dax -> meaning. Rule: dax translates to the color green. Whenever the word ""dax"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is the color green.
Based on the examples provided where the input and corresponding output are given, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"". Regardless of its position within a sequence of words, each instance of the nonce word ""wif"" results in ""red"" in the output. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red

This implies that ""wif"" means red in the context provided.
Based on the given examples:

- Whenever ""zup"" appears after ""wif walm,"" the output sequence adds ""red red red yellow.""
- When ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" precedes and follows ""zup,"" the output is ""blue yellow blue.""
- In the third example, ""zup"" precedes ""dax"" (green) and ""wif"" (red), resulting in ""yellow green red.""
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf,"" which may translate to ""yellow,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- When ""zup"" stands alone, the output is simply ""yellow.""

This information suggests that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the output, regardless of its position or what follows it.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to find a pattern in the given examples that correlates with the output.

Examining the input-output pairs, we can try to correlate each word with its respective color:

1. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
2. lug dax bluf -> blue green green
3. zup bluf lug -> yellow yellow blue
4. lug bluf -> blue blue
5. lug bluf -> blue blue

Let’s consider the word ""bluf"" in different positions and see how it affects the output:

- In examples 1 and 2, ""bluf"" follows the word ""dax"" and the color green appears next in the sequence.
- In example 3, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the next color in the sequence is yellow.
- In examples 4 and 5, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and the color blue appears twice.

It seems that ""bluf"" correlates with the color that is assigned to the word immediately before it. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"", ""green"" follows. When preceded by ""lug"", ""blue"" follows. When preceded by ""zup"", ""yellow"" follows.

Given these observations, we can induce that ""bluf"" represents a rule where it mimics the color of the preceding word:

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the word immediately before it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in each of the given examples by comparing the inputs to their corresponding outputs.

1. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   - We see that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"".
   - The sequence ""walm"" at the end corresponds to three repetitions of ""yellow"".

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
   - The sequence ""walm"" corresponds to two more ""green"" outputs.

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - This is the same as the previous example, resulting in the same pattern.

4. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   - Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", ""dax"" to ""green"".
   - Following ""zup"", ""walm"" leads to two more ""yellow"" before a ""green"" which corresponds to ""dax"".

5. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""dax"" to ""green"".
   - After ""dax"", ""walm"" leads to two more ""green"" colors before the pattern changes with another ""zup"".

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the previous word to be repeated twice more. Therefore, if the color before ""walm"" is ""yellow,"" we get ""yellow"" two more times, and if the color before ""walm"" is ""green,"" we get ""green"" two more times. ""Walm"" does not produce an output on its own; it's a rule that repeats the previous output.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color output corresponding to the word right before it two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif walm
    ",Output: blue red red red,blue red red red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in all given examples. Regardless of the position of ""lug"" within the input sequence or the other words present, the output consistently includes the color ""blue"" corresponding to the occurrence of ""lug.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each nonce word correlates with a specific color as follows:

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> blue
- bluf -> red

When these words are presented in the input, they result in their corresponding color in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: In this context, ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of the position in the sequence or the other words present.
Based on the examples provided, we can see that the output consists of a sequence of color names. The nonce word ""zup"" appears to correspond to a particular color in the output sequence every time it is mentioned. Here are the possible correlations based on each input-output pair:

1. Input: wif zup | Output: red yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

2. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif | Output: blue green yellow green green green red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
   - ""walm"" doesn't have a one-to-one correspondence but always follows ""dax"" which is ""green"", so it may not affect ""zup"".
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

3. Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif | Output: red red yellow yellow red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" in this context, but the second ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow"", which implies it might repeat the previous color or simply be ignored, as it appears inconsistently in the output.
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

4. Input: wif zup bluf | Output: red yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
   - ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and is output as ""yellow"", reinforcing the idea that ""bluf"" may repeat the previous color or be ignored (since it does not add a new color).
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

5. Input: lug zup | Output: blue yellow
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

Based on the outputs, we can induce that ""zup"" consistently yields the color ""yellow"" in the output. The presence of other words like ""bluf"" or ""walm"" may be conditional or repetitive elements, but ""zup"" itself remains constant. Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the provided examples. Each instance of ""bluf"" in the input is translated to ""red"" in the output.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the provided input-output examples.

1. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

2. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

3. Input: zup walm lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue

4. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

From these examples, it seems that the presence of ""walm"" in the input leads to a repetition of the color before it is introduced.
- In the first example, blue repeats thrice, which corresponds to ""lug walm dax"".
- In the second example, red repeats three times, which corresponds to ""wif walm"".
- In the third example, yellow repeats three times, which corresponds to ""zup walm lug"".
- In the fourth example, blue repeats three times after ""lug"" as well, which corresponds to ""lug walm wif"".
- In the fifth example, yellow repeats three times with just ""zup walm"".

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the color represented by the word immediately before it to repeat three times. If there is no word before ""walm"" to determine its color, as in example 5, it repeats the color associated with the first word in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to repeat three times. If ""walm"" is the second word, it repeats the color of the first word in the sequence three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems reasonable to deduce that ""lug"" is associated with the word ""blue."" Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Here is the rule based on the examples:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided:

- When ""wif"" is preceded by the word ""lug"" (lug walm wif lug), the output does not contain red where ""wif"" is used in the input, implying that ""lug"" affects the color associated with ""wif"".
- When ""wif"" is used alone, the output is always red.
- When ""wif"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""lug"" (dax lug wif), the output for ""wif"" is red, matching the output when ""wif"" is standalone.

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, regardless of the context in which it appears.
Rule: zup -> yellow
From the given examples, it looks like ""bluf"" corresponds to the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""bluf"" in the input. Below is how ""bluf"" is associated in each example:

1. dax zup bluf -> dax corresponds to green, zup corresponds to yellow, and bluf also corresponds to yellow.
2. wif zup bluf -> wif corresponds to red, zup corresponds to yellow, and bluf also corresponds to yellow.
3. lug wif lug bluf -> lug correlates with blue, and bluf also correlates with blue.
4. wif bluf -> wif corresponds to red, and bluf also corresponds to red.
5. wif zup dax bluf -> wif corresponds to red, zup corresponds to yellow, dax corresponds to green, and bluf corresponds to green.

Rule: bluf corresponds to the color associated with the word immediately previous to it in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's take a systematic look at each of the given examples and analyze the positions where ""walm"" appears and the corresponding output colors.

Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow
- ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) and is followed by ""zup"" (yellow).

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
- ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) and is the last word in the sequence.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) and is the last word in the sequence.

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
- ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and is followed by ""dax"" (green).

Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
- ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and is followed by ""lug"" (blue).

Based on the outputs, ""walm"" consistently results in the color green. Additionally, the examples show that ""walm"" does not depend on its position relative to other words, as it yields green whether it's in the middle or at the end of a sequence. Therefore, a probable rule is:

walm -> meaning: The word ""walm"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position or neighboring words.

Rule: The word ""walm"" translates to the output color green.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""
Based on the examples provided:

- The output for ""wif"" alone is consistently ""red"".
- When ""wif"" is used in combination with other words, the output for ""wif"" remains ""red"".

The other words in the examples seem to correspond with their own distinct colors:

- ""dax"" corresponds with ""green"".
- ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow"".

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in a sequence.
Given the examples provided, it's possible to work out the pattern by identifying what changes in the output when ""zup"" is introduced in the input.

The key observations are:
- Whenever ""zup"" is present, the output always includes the color yellow.
- The position of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to the position of ""yellow"" in the output.

Now, let's examine each usage of ""zup"":

1. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red
   - ""zup"" corresponds with the first and fifth ""yellow"".

2. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   - Here, ""zup"" is second, so ""yellow"" is also second.

3. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   - ""zup"" is first and matches the first ""yellow"".

4. Input: lug zup dax zup
   Output: blue yellow green yellow
   - ""zup"" matches the second and fourth ""yellow"".

5. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
   Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
   - ""zup"" at the beginning and end matches the ""yellow"" at the beginning and end.

From these examples, we can deduce:

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, at the same position as the occurrence of ""zup"" in the input sequence.

Thus:

zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at the input-output pairs provided:

1 - Input: zup wif bluf -> Output: yellow red red
   Rule: ""zup"" translates to yellow, ""wif"" to red, thus ""bluf"" might be represented by the second red.

2 - Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug -> Output: blue red green green red blue
   Rule: ""lug"" translates to blue, ""wif"" to red, and ""dax"" to green. ""Bluf"" appears after ""dax"" and is also green. However, the sequence ""green red blue"" at the end corresponds to ""bluf wif lug.""

3 - Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green
   Rule: ""dax"" translates to green, and ""bluf"" is followed with green again, just like the previous example where ""bluf"" followed ""dax.""

4 - Input: wif dax bluf -> Output: red green green
   Rule: ""wif"" translates to red, ""dax"" to green, and ""bluf"" is again green following ""dax.""

5 - Input: zup bluf lug zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   Rule: ""zup"" translates to yellow, ""lug"" to blue. ""Bluf"" here is followed by another yellow, similar to the first example where ""bluf"" was represented by the color that preceded it, red. ""Walm"" seems to translate to yellow as well.

Based on the above observations, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word that precedes it. In contexts where ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (green), ""bluf"" is green, and when it follows ""zup"" (yellow), ""bluf"" is yellow. 

Rule: bluf -> The color of the word immediately before it.
Analyzing the provided inputs and their corresponding outputs, let's look at the position of ""walm"" and the color associated with it:

1. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow

2. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue

3. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue

4. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue

5. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

From the examples above, we can infer the following:

- When ""walm"" appears after ""wif"", the color ""red"" is outputted.
- When ""walm"" stands alone or is not directly after ""wif"", the color is different from ""red"".

To verify our rule further, let's contrast the use of ""wif"" followed by colors other than ""red"":

- ""wif"" before ""walm"" consistently leads to ""red"".
- ""wif"" without ""walm"" following it leads to ""red"" for the instance of ""wif"" but not consistently for the word after ""wif"".

Additional observations:

- ""walm"" appears to be the last word before a color shift happens.
- In the second example, where ""wif"" does not immediately precede ""walm"", the word after ""walm"" (""lug"") is associated with ""blue"".
- In the fourth example, the only instance of ""red"" occurs directly after ""walm"" indicates that ""walm"" might transfer the 'color value' of ""wif"" (which is ""red"") to the word following it.

Taking all this into account, a consistent pattern seems to be that ""walm"" has the function of duplicating the 'color value' of the word preceding it (assuming ""wif"" has a color value of ""red""). The color change observed after ""walm"" would be a separate rule not directly related to the meaning of ""walm"" itself but rather the positional context of ""lug"" which seems to be ""blue"".

Rule: ""walm"" duplicates the color value of the word that immediately precedes it. If ""wif"" immediately precedes ""walm"", the output color is ""red"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif walm
    ",Output: red red red,red red red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the output is ""blue.""
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the output. The correspondence is direct and does not seem to depend on the position of the word ""wif"" within the input sequence or on adjacent words. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" is as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, each word corresponds to a color. The word ""zup"" appears to take the place of a color in a sequence of colors. The color that ""zup"" represents seems to change depending on its position relative to other colors. 

To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look at the inputs and outputs:

1. Input: lug zup wif lug -> Output: blue yellow red blue
2. Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> Output: green blue yellow red red green
3. Input: zup lug dax -> Output: yellow blue green
4. Input: wif dax zup -> Output: red green yellow
5. Input: dax zup lug wif lug -> Output: green yellow blue red blue

We need to determine a pattern that allows ""zup"" to be yellow in all these examples. Considering its position, ""zup"" is never the first word in the input list when translated, but it appears in various other positions. It seems that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" irrespective of its position.

Thus, the rule seems to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow
From the given examples, it's possible to infer the meaning of the word ""bluf"" by looking at the pattern of the output colors.

- In the first example, ""dax bluf wif lug"" maps to ""green green red blue."" Since ""dax"" outputs ""green"" and the second word ""bluf"" also outputs ""green"", we might infer that ""bluf"" could mean ""repeat the color of the previous word.""

- This pattern holds in the second example, ""wif bluf lug zup"" which maps to ""red red blue yellow."" Here again, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" with the same output color ""red.""

- The third example, ""zup bluf wif lug dax,"" outputs ""yellow yellow red blue green."" ""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" and repeats the color ""yellow.""

- In the fourth example, ""wif lug bluf wif zup,"" the output is ""red blue blue red yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" appears after ""lug,"" which is represented by blue, and the output for ""bluf"" is indeed ""blue,"" which reinforces the rule.

- Lastly, in the fifth example, ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red,"" where once more, ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word, which is ""red.""

Based on the given examples, the rule for ""bluf"" could be stated as:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the previous word.
Analyzing the given examples, we see a pattern in the output for the input that includes the word ""walm.""

1. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

3. Input: lug dax walm
   Output: blue green green green

4. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue

5. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue

Here's what we can deduce for each colour:

- dax => green
- lug => blue
- zup => yellow
- wif => red
- walm seems to repeat the color of the word before it multiple times

Now we'll apply this rule to see if it holds up:

1. wif (red), dax (green), zup (yellow), walm -> repeats yellow 3 times (correct)

2. dax (green), walm -> repeats green 3 times (correct)

3. lug (blue), dax (green), walm -> repeats green 4 times (correct if we consider the first green is for 'dax')

4. zup (yellow), lug (blue), walm -> repeats blue 4 times (correct if we consider the first blue is for 'lug')

5. wif (red), walm, lug (blue), bluf -> repeats red 3 times then blue twice (correct)

Based on the provided input and output examples, the following rule for ""walm"" can be deduced:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word the same number of times as there are letters in that word.

In these cases, ""walm"" is not a distinct color itself, but instead, a command to repeat the color of the word before it in the output sequence for a number of times equal to the length of that word. Therefore, ""walm"" after a three-letter word would produce three instances of the corresponding color, a four-letter word would produce four instances, and so on.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf
    ",Output: yellow yellow,yellow yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds consistently to the color ""blue."" This can be confirmed by looking at each pair of input and output and noticing that every time ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Here are the correlations in each example:
- Input: ""dax lug"" -> Output: ""green blue"" (lug corresponds to blue)
- Input: ""lug wif zup wif walm"" -> Output: ""blue red yellow red red red"" (lug corresponds to blue)
- Input: ""lug zup lug"" -> Output: ""blue yellow blue"" (both instances of lug correspond to blue)
- Input: ""zup bluf dax lug"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow green blue"" (lug corresponds to blue)
- Input: ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" -> Output: ""red blue blue red yellow"" (lug corresponds to blue)

Therefore, the rule deduced for the nonce word ""lug"" is as follows:
Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> ""green"", and each following word changes the color output in a pattern.

Analyzing the given examples:

1. dax wif walm lug zup walm
   - Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - Pattern observation: 'wif' leads to red, 'walm' leads to yellow, but following an already established color will repeat that color (e.g., red red, yellow yellow), 'zup' changes the pattern to blue and 'lug' changes it to red.

2. dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   - Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   - 'zup' changes the color to yellow, but it's not clear what 'bluf' does. Since it's followed by 'wif', which we know leads to red, the effect of 'bluf' is indeterminate.

3. zup lug walm wif dax
   - Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   - The pattern continues with 'zup' leading to yellow, 'lug' leading to blue, 'walm' is not followed by the same word so its pattern change cannot be determined. The input ends with 'dax', which leads to green.

4. dax wif
   - Output: green red
   - Consistent with the established meaning that 'dax' is green and 'wif' changes it to red.

5. dax wif zup dax
   - Output: green red yellow green
   - 'dax' leads to green, 'wif' to red, 'zup' to yellow, and 'dax' again to green.

Based on the pattern observed, it seems that 'dax' introduces the color green and is not influenced by the preceding word. It acts as a reset to the color green. The other words ('wif', 'zup', 'lug', 'walm') influence the color output and can cause repetition if they are repeated in sequence ('wif wif' leads to ""red red"", 'walm walm' leads to ""yellow yellow"").

Rule: dax -> ""green"" (initiator / reset to green)
Based on the examples given, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" correlates with the color red in the output. This is consistent across all examples provided. There is no change in output related to ""wif"" when it is combined with other words, including ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" ""zup,"" or ""walm.""

As such, the rule appears to be:

wif -> meaning: ""wif"" translates to the color red. 

Rule: wif always corresponds to the color red in the output, regardless of its position or the other words present.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the examples provided, whenever the word 'zup' appears in the input, the corresponding output is 'yellow'. This implies that the word 'zup' translates to the color 'yellow' in the output.
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the word before it.
walm -> three repetitions of a color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, the output is the color associated with that preceding word repeated three times. If ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the color is blue, repeated three times. If ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the color is yellow, repeated three times. ""Walm"" does not have a color by itself but repeats the color associated with the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
Rule: dax -> green. 

Explanation:
- When dax appears alone or in combination with other words, it consistently maps to the output ""green"".
- There is no evidence from the examples provided that dax's meaning changes based on context; its meaning appears fixed regardless of where it appears in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's examine the role it plays in the transformation from input to output across the given examples:

1. Input: wif zup - Output: red yellow
2. Input: wif bluf dax walm - Output: red red green green green
3. Input: wif dax - Output: red green
4. Input: wif bluf lug dax wif - Output: red red blue green red
5. Input: lug wif zup wif walm - Output: blue red yellow red red red

From these examples, the following patterns can be observed regarding the word ""wif"":

- Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output.
- ""wif"" can be at the beginning or in the middle of a sequence.
- Other words following ""wif"" correspond to different colors in the output (e.g., ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" to ""red red"").
- The appearance of ""wif"" does not affect the color associated with other words (e.g., ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow"").

From the above analysis, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each occurrence of ""wif"" translates directly to ""red"" in the output sequence, irrespective of its position or the other words around it. 

Therefore, we can deduce:

wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to a specific color in each instance. Here's how each instance of ""zup"" fits into the output sequence:

Input: wif lug bluf wif zup
Output: red blue blue red yellow
(zup corresponds to yellow)

Input: lug zup lug
Output: blue yellow blue
(zup corresponds to yellow)

Input: zup dax
Output: yellow green
(zup corresponds to yellow)

Input: dax zup dax walm
Output: green yellow green green green
(zup corresponds to yellow)

Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow
(zup corresponds to yellow)

So the rule for ""zup"" across all examples is consistent:
zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue."" Thus, the rule is as follows:

Rule: bluf -> blue
Based on the given examples, we can infer that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat multiple times depending on the context it is used in. More specifically, ""walm"" seems to repeat the output color of the word that comes immediately before it. Let's examine the examples to deduce how many times the previous color is repeated:

1. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   ""lug"" translates to blue, and after ""walm"" three additional blue colors appear.

2. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   ""zup"" translates to yellow, and after ""walm"" three additional yellow colors appear.

3. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   ""wif"" translates to red, and after ""walm"" two additional red colors appear.

4. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   Here, ""walm"" appears twice. The first instance causes two additional reds after ""wif."" The second instance follows ""zup,"" translating to yellow, and results in three additional yellows.

5. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   ""wif"" translates to red, and after ""walm"" two additional reds appear.

It appears that ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word. However, there is an inconsistency in the number of repetitions, which seems to increase with the length of the input. To refine our rule further, in inputs 1, 2, and 4, the third example output includes three repetitions after ""walm,"" while in inputs 3 and 5, with shorter sequences, ""walm"" produces two additional repetitions. 

This suggests that ""walm"" repeats the previous color a number of times based on some aspect of the input sequence length or position. Examining further, we can summarize the behavior as follows:

The number of repetitions seems to be the same as the number of words preceding ""walm"". For example:
- In the first input ""dax lug walm"", ""lug"" is the second word and is repeated twice after ""walm"".
- In the second input ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"", ""zup"" is the third word and is repeated thrice after ""walm"".

However, there's an inconsistency with the third input ""wif walm"", where ""wif"" should be repeated once but is instead repeated twice. This might be a special case where a minimum of two repetitions is the default when ""walm"" follows a single word. 

Therefore, based on the analysis, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color of the word before it as many times as the position of that word, with a minimum of two repetitions in case ""walm"" follows immediately after the first word.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word as many times as the position of that word in the sequence (with a minimum of two repetitions when the preceding word is first in sequence).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule:
In each example, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Rule:
dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the series of words. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in every given example.
Based on the information given in the examples, we can try to determine the meaning of ""bluf"" by analyzing its output in various contexts. Here's how ""bluf"" appears to translate in each provided example:

Input: zup bluf lug zup
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow
Rule: When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", it translates to ""blue"".

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
Rule: Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" again and translates to ""blue"".

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
Rule: ""Bluf"" is followed by ""dax"", but since ""bluf"" is output as ""red"", not green, it indicates that its translation does not depend on the word that follows it.

Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
Output: yellow blue red green green red
Rule: In this example, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" and translates to ""green"".

Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
Output: green green red blue yellow
Rule: Again, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and translates to ""green"".

Now, to consolidate the rules: 

- Every time ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"", it translates to ""yellow"".
- Every time ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"", it translates to ""green"".

However, there is one anomaly in the second input where ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" but does not translate to ""yellow"", possibly due to a pattern we don't understand with the given data. But within the given examples except for the anomaly, the pattern holds.

Therefore, our deduced meaning is:

bluf -> meaning.
Rule: ""Bluf"" means ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup"" and ""green"" when it follows ""dax"".
However, given the anomaly in the second input (which we can't rule out without more information), we must consider that ""bluf"" might have context-dependent meanings that we haven't fully uncovered.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we will look at each instance of ""walm"" in the given examples and the corresponding output:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow

2. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green

4. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to yellow

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green

Looking at the outputs related to where ""walm"" occurs, we can determine the following:

- In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" and the output sequence is ""red red red green,"" implying that ""walm"" might be translated to three instances of the color ""red"" just before a ""dax.""

- In the second example, ""walm"" occurs after a ""lug"" (blue) and is between ""wif"" instances (red). In both occurrences of ""walm,"" it leads to outputs of ""red red red.""

- In the third and fifth examples, ""walm"" immediately follows ""dax"" and also yields an output of ""green green green,"" again suggesting the occurrence of a sequence of a color corresponding to the word preceding ""walm."" However, the repeated color in the output doesn't match the color code for ""dax"" (green), but since ""dax"" outputs one green and ""walm"" follows, resulting in three greens, ""walm"" seems to be a multiplier rather than a color on its own.

- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the pattern continues—three instances of the color related to ""wif"" (red) appear.

Based on these observations, ""walm"" seems to be a rule rather than a direct color association. The rule appears to be as follows: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning based on the examples provided: blue

Rule: The noun ""lug"" seems to consistently translate to the color ""blue"" in each example given.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we can look at the consistent pattern in the input-output pairs.

- When ""wif walm dax zup"" appears, it translates to ""red red red green yellow."" The first three words consistently map to ""red red red."" When ""dax"" follows these words, it maps to ""green"" even though ""zup"" at the end maps to ""yellow."" 
- When ""zup dax lug"" appears, it translates to ""yellow green blue."" Here, ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
- The repetition of ""wif walm dax zup"" confirms the mapping seen in the first example.
- For ""zup lug wif dax lug,"" it translates to ""yellow blue red green blue."" Again, consistent mappings for ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif"" are apparent, with ""dax"" translating to ""green.""
- Lastly, ""dax lug wif"" translates to ""green blue red,"" with ""lug"" and ""wif"" retaining their mappings.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:
- dax -> green

Rule: Regardless of its position in the sequence, ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green.""
Given the examples:

- lug zup wif -> blue yellow red
- zup bluf wif -> yellow yellow red
- wif zup -> red yellow
- wif bluf dax -> red red green
- zup wif dax walm lug -> yellow red green green green blue

We notice that ""wif"" results in the word ""red"" in both its first appearance and second appearance regardless of its position within the sequence and the words around it are translated into colors different from red. Therefore, the rule seems to be consistent and independent of context:

Rule: wif -> red.
By examining the patterns and the input-output pairs, we can attempt to deduce the rule that governs the meaning of the word ""zup"":

1. wif bluf zup bluf wif -> red red yellow yellow red
2. zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue
3. wif lug zup walm wif lug -> red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
4. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
5. zup wif lug wif -> yellow red blue red

The constant across these examples is that every time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output. Let's check each case:

1. ""zup"" occurs once, and there is one ""yellow"" in the corresponding position in the output.
2. ""zup"" occurs once at the beginning, and the first color in the output is ""yellow"".
3. ""zup"" occurs once, followed by two occurrences of ""yellow"" in the output. This may suggest that ""zup"" indicates a ""yellow,"" but there's also another ""yellow,"" suggesting that the following word ""walm"" might also mean ""yellow.""
4. ""zup"" occurs once, followed by a ""yellow"" in the output. This is consistent with our ongoing assumption.
5. ""zup"" occurs once at the beginning, and the output starts with a ""yellow.""

If we follow this pattern and rely on the consistency observed, the meaning of ""zup"" appears to be straightforward:

Rule: zup -> yellow

In each instance where ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output always includes the color ""yellow.""
bluf -> red. Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position or the surrounding words.
Analyzing the examples provided, let's first note the colors associated with each known word:

- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue

Now let's focus on the examples provided for the nonce word ""walm"".

1. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   The word ""walm"" seems to result in repeated colors of the word that precedes it, except for ""zup"". Here it repeated ""green"" from ""dax"".

2. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow
   In this case, ""walm"" resulted in repeating the color of ""wif"".

3. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   ""walm"" repeated the color of ""lug"".

4. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue
   ""walm"" repeated the color of ""lug"" again, but not ""wif"" following it.

5. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
   ""walm"" repeated the color blue from ""lug"", and the rest followed the usual pattern.

In each case, ""walm"" seems to cause a repetition of the color of the word immediately preceding it, except when followed by ""zup"", where it didn't influence ""walm"" to repeat ""yellow"".

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
From the given examples, we can infer the following:

Input: lug zup lug
Output: blue yellow blue

Input: dax lug
Output: green blue

Input: lug dax wif lug
Output: blue green red blue

Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue

Each time we see the word ""lug"" in the input, it corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output. This mapping is consistent across all provided examples. 

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be related to the position and presence of the word ""dax"" in the input and how it corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. In every example, whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. This pattern is consistently observed regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence.

No further information is provided about the meaning of other words or why they correspond to specific colors in the output. Additionally, no context or rule is given about the relationship between the other words (""zup,"" ""walm,"" ""wif"") and their corresponding colors in the output. However, we can infer that these words are associated with different colors based on their position relative to ""dax.""

Here is the meaning derived from the examples:

dax -> green

Rule:
- The presence of ""dax"" in the input results in ""green"" in the corresponding position of the output.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" There is a consistent pattern in the output whenever ""wif"" is mentioned: it is always translated as ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: Regardless of the position or presence of other words, ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".
bluf -> repeat the color associated with the previous word. Rule: When bluf follows a word, it duplicates the color that word represents. For example, if ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" then ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green"".
Analyzing the inputs and corresponding outputs, let's look at the pattern associated with the nonce word ""walm.""

Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red

Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green

Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

We can observe the following patterns when ""walm"" is present in the inputs:

1. The word immediately before ""walm"" is repeated in color in the output before the pattern changes. For example:
   - In ""wif zup walm,"" ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and after ""walm,"" we see ""yellow"" repeated.
   - In ""lug walm dax,"" ""lug"" is associated with blue, and after ""walm,"" we see ""blue"" repeated before it changes to ""green"" for ""dax.""

2. The repetition of the color is consistent regardless of the position of ""walm"" in the sequence.
   - ""wif walm zup lug"" has ""red red red"" before the pattern shifts with ""yellow"" for ""zup.""

3. The color sequence length after ""walm"" seems consistent with the instance prior to ""walm."" For example:
   - ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" has a three-count red followed by a two-count yellow, then one-count blue, and again a two-count yellow following the second ""walm.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that the nonce word causes the color of the word immediately before it to repeat a number of times equal to the instance count of that word before ""walm"" appears.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the word right before it to repeat for the number of times the word has appeared before ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax lug zup lug
    ",Output: blue green blue yellow blue,blue green blue yellow blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that each nonce word is associated with a specific color:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red (deduced by elimination since ""wif"" is repeated three times before ""lug"" and the output is ""red red red blue"")

Therefore, the rule is that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word 'zup' translates to the word 'yellow'. Each instance of 'zup' in the input corresponds to 'yellow' in the output.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the presented examples, we can attempt to figure out what the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to in the outputs. Observe each instance where ""bluf"" occurs and the corresponding output:

1. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
2. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red
3. dax zup wif bluf lug -> green yellow red red blue
4. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
5. lug wif bluf dax lug bluf -> blue red red green blue blue

It seems that every time ""bluf"" is mentioned, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding output. However, we need to also consider that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the first and third examples. This contradiction suggests that ""bluf"" may not have a single static translation but that it may have variable meaning dependent on context or position. 

Let's consider the positions and context: 

1. ""bluf"" occurs second and is translated as ""red.""
2. ""bluf"" occurs fourth and is translated as ""yellow.""
3. ""bluf"" occurs fourth and is translated as ""red.""
4. ""bluf"" occurs second and is translated as ""yellow.""
5. ""bluf"" occurs third and sixth and is both times translated as ""red.""

Upon further examination, there is a pattern where ""bluf"" is consistently translated to ""red"" when preceding or following the nonce words ""wif"" and ""lug."" In other instances, ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow."" However, case 4 contradicts this because ""bluf"" is second and is translated as ""yellow,"" but there is no ""lug"" or ""wif"" around. So, the rule might be slightly more complex than initially observed.

Considering the complexity of the provided data and the potential for additional hidden variables affecting the translation, the rule for ""bluf"" is not entirely consistent. The majority rule here is that ""bluf"" seems to translate to ""red"" when adjoining specific nonce words and otherwise to ""yellow.""

Rule: ""bluf"" is usually translated to ""red"" when next to certain nonce words (such as ""wif"" or ""lug"") and to ""yellow"" in other positions or contexts, with some exceptions or influences of neighboring words yet to be understood.
Based on the examples given, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" generates a sequence of the word ""green"" in the output, while the other words (""lug"", ""zup"", ""wif"", ""dax"") translate to a single word each (""blue"", ""yellow"", ""red"", ""green"", respectively).

Rules identified:

- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""dax"" -> ""green""

Therefore, we can induce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> a sequence of ""green"", where the number of repetitions of ""green"" is determined by the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence. Specifically, ""walm"" at the first position after another word produces three repetitions, ""walm"" at the second position after another word produces two repetitions, and ""walm"" at the third or any subsequent position produces one repetition of ""green"".

Let's check the rule against each example:

Example 1: 
Input: lug walm zup lug walm
Rule Application: ""lug"" -> blue, ""walm"" after ""lug"" -> three greens, ""zup"" -> yellow, ""lug"" -> blue, ""walm"" after ""lug"" -> three greens
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue

Example 2: 
Input: zup wif dax walm
Rule Application: ""zup"" -> yellow, ""wif"" -> red, ""dax"" -> green, ""walm"" after ""dax"" -> three greens
Output: yellow red green green green

Example 3: 
Input: zup dax walm lug wif
Rule Application: ""zup"" -> yellow, ""dax"" -> green, ""walm"" after ""dax"" -> two greens, ""lug"" -> blue, ""wif"" -> red
Output: yellow green green green blue red

Example 4: 
Input: lug walm
Rule Application: ""lug"" -> blue, ""walm"" after ""lug"" -> three greens
Output: blue blue blue

Example 5: 
Input: wif dax zup walm
Rule Application: ""wif"" -> red, ""dax"" -> green, ""zup"" -> yellow, ""walm"" after ""zup"" -> one green
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

However, upon reviewing the last example, it seems that the rule does not hold as expected. The inconsistency suggests the need for revision.

Corrected Rule: It appears the ""walm"" generates two ""green"" outputs if it is the last word in the sequence; otherwise, it generates three ""green"" outputs when followed by ""lug"", but only one ""green"" when followed by other words.

Let's recheck with this adjusted rule:

Example 1: 
Input: lug walm zup lug walm
Rule Application: ""lug"" -> blue, ""walm"" after ""lug"" -> three greens, ""zup"" -> yellow, ""lug"" -> blue, ""walm"" after ""lug"" -> three greens
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue (consistent)

Example 2: 
Input: zup wif dax walm
Rule Application: ""zup"" -> yellow, ""wif"" -> red, ""dax"" -> green, ""walm"" as last word -> two greens
Output: yellow red green green green (consistent)

Example 3: 
Input: zup dax walm lug wif
Rule Application: ""zup"" -> yellow, ""dax"" -> green, ""walm"" followed by ""lug"" -> three greens, ""lug"" -> blue, ""wif"" -> red
Output: yellow green green green blue red (consistent)

Example 4: 
Input: lug walm
Rule Application: ""lug"" -> blue, ""walm"" as last word -> two greens
Output: blue blue blue (consistent with the previous understanding that walm generates three greens after lug, but this needs further examples to solidify)

Example 5: 
Input: wif dax zup walm
Rule Application: ""wif"" -> red, ""dax"" -> green, ""zup"" -> yellow, ""walm"" as last word -> two greens
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow (inconsistent with the adjusted rule)

With the inconsistency in example 5, it's challenging to deduce a precise rule that fits all examples. The rule induction will require additional examples to fine-tune the meaning of ""walm"". Therefore, a definitive rule cannot be established with the given data.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

    ",Output: red blue red,red blue red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, I will determine what ""lug"" corresponds to in terms of color output.

First, let's list the examples with my observations:

1. Input: wif dax wif lug wif
   Output: red green red blue red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""dax"" to green. ""lug"" produces blue when it follows ""wif"".

2. Input: dax lug
   Output: green blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green, followed directly by ""lug"" which produces blue.

3. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   - The first ""lug"" with no preceding word results in blue, ""bluf"" translates to blue, ""wif"" to red. ""lug"" following ""wif"" is again blue. ""walm"" corresponds to red here, and so the ""lug"" following is blue.
   
4. Input: lug dax lug
   Output: blue green blue
   - Starting with ""lug"" results in blue, ""dax"" is green, and then ""lug"" is blue again.

5. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   - ""dax"" at the start is green, followed by ""lug"" which is blue. ""walm"" here is followed by ""dax"" and both produce blue, but from the previous examples, we can assume that ""walm"" by itself might be red, altering depending on the context, possibly the subsequent word. ""wif"" translates to red, ""bluf"" to blue here (we can assume it is an exception) and the final ""dax"" to green.

From these observations, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to blue, irrespective of its position in the sequences or the words it follows or precedes.

Therefore, the rule is:

lug -> blue

Meaning:
Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in the outputs provided.
Based on the provided examples, it can be deduced that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently translates to the English word ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Each instance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output, regardless of what other words are present.
Based on the given examples, we can induce the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" as follows:

In all given examples, whenever the word ""zup"" appears, the corresponding output is ""yellow."" No matter the position of ""zup"" in the input sentence or the words that come before or after it, the output remains consistent.

Here are the inductions step by step:

1. Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
   Output: green green red yellow red
   The word ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow.""

2. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   Again, ""zup"" is the first word and corresponds with ""yellow.""

3. Input: zup
   Output: yellow
   ""Zup"" is the only word and it corresponds with ""yellow.""

4. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
   Output: red green red red yellow red
   ""Zup"" is the second to last word and corresponds with ""yellow.""

5. Input: zup lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow blue yellow red green
   ""Zup"" is the first and third word, and both instances correspond with ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow. The word ""zup"" always corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position or surrounding words in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Let's go through the examples:

1. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which translates to ""red.""

2. Input: zup bluf dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow green blue
   Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow.""

3. Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
   Here, the first ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" and the second ""bluf"" again follows ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow.""

4. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
   Here, the first ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which translates to ""green,"" and the second ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow.""

5. Input: zup bluf dax
   Output: yellow yellow green
   Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word just before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.
walm -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, ""walm"" seems to result in a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that precedes it. Each instance of ""walm"" follows a color-coded word (""lug,"" ""dax,"" and ""wif""), and the output repeats the color that corresponds to that word. The number of times the color repeats corresponds to the number of times ""walm"" occurs.

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the word preceding it as many times as ""walm"" appears. If ""walm"" follows a word with an assigned color, the color is repeated three times because ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output. If ""walm"" does not follow a word with an assigned color, it defaults to repeating the color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in each instance where it appears. Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red

Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color red in this context.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently correlates with the color ""yellow"" in the output. Each occurrence of ""zup"" in the input results in ""yellow"" appearing as the first color in the output sequence, regardless of the context or the presence of other words.

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" is present in the input, the color ""yellow"" is included in the output, specifically as the first color mentioned.
Rule: bluf -> green when following the word ""dax"", blue when following the word ""lug"".
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's first look at each input example and its corresponding output to identify any patterns.

1. Input: dax walm zup walm
   Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

2. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

3. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

4. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue

5. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red

Analyzing the examples, let's note the following patterns:

- ""dax"" is always followed by ""green green green.""
- ""wif"" is always followed by ""red red.""
- ""zup"" is always followed by ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- ""lug"" is always followed by ""blue blue blue.""
- The word ""walm"" appears in the input before a color pattern but does not have its own distinct color.

Given these observations, it seems that ""walm"" serves as a repeater for the color associated with the word that follows it. However, it does not repeat the last word's color but rather the color associated with the following word. Below are the rules derived from the examples, with ""walm"" referring to the previous color pattern:

- After ""dax,"" we see ""green green green.""
- After ""wif,"" we see ""red red.""
- After ""zup,"" we see an extended ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- After ""lug,"" we see an extended ""blue blue blue.""

Here's the rule based on the given context:

Rule: walm -> ""walm"" repeats the color pattern of the word that follows it three times. If ""walm"" is the last word, it repeats the pattern of the word preceding it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax lug dax
    ",Output: yellow green blue green,yellow green blue green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue.""
dax -> meaning. The meaning appears to be the color ""green.""

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output contains the color ""green.""
Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Each instance of the word ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow.""
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the word ""bluf"" seems to depend on the context of the words positioned before it:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is yellow.
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" or ""wif,"" the output is green or red, respectively.

However, there is no example provided for ""bluf"" following ""lug,"" so we cannot determine the exact output for that combination. Notably, in both instances where ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue,"" but this might not be a sufficient sample to conclude this as a rule for every occurrence of ""lug bluf.""

Observing the above, ""bluf"" does not have a consistent output across different contexts, implying that ""bluf"" is modified by the preceding word. Hence, the rule cannot be a single consistent output; instead, ""bluf"" changes meaning based on what word precedes it.

Given these points, we can infer a tentative rule:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the word immediately before it:
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output is potentially ""blue,"" but more examples would be needed to confirm this.

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" changes depending on the word that comes directly before it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns in the provided examples and the respective outputs:

- In the first example:
  Input: zup wif dax walm
  Output: yellow red green green green

- In the second example:
  Input: wif walm
  Output: red red red

- In the third and fourth examples:
  Input: wif walm dax zup
  Output: red red red green yellow

- In the fifth example:
  Input: wif lug dax walm
  Output: red blue green green green

Looking at the outputs, ""walm"" seems to produce ""red red red"" when it follows ""wif,"" as shown in the second example. However, in the other examples where ""walm"" is present, the ""red red red"" pattern is not always immediately after ""wif."" It is evident that ""walm"" consistently results in three instances of ""green"" at the end of the output sequence, regardless of the preceding words.

Given this information, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to a repeated output of ""green"" three times, irrespective of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: walm -> ""green green green""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the provided outputs.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in a sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each nonce word (dax, wif, lug, zup) corresponds to a unique color:

- dax corresponds to green
- lug corresponds to blue
- zup corresponds to yellow
- wif corresponds to red

No matter the position of the words in the input, the corresponding color remains the same.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it can be deduced that the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"". Here's how this conclusion is drawn:

- Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output.
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" as seen in the first input-output pair.
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" as evident from the third and fourth input-output pairs.
- The appearance of the other words does not affect the translation of ""zup"" to ""yellow"".

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" can be stated as:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the input contains ""zup"", include ""yellow"" in the output at the corresponding position.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's start by analysing the input-output pairs provided:

- In the first input-output pair, ""bluf"" is associated with ""green.""
- In the second input-output pair, ""bluf"" is associated with ""blue.""
- In the third input-output pair, ""bluf"" is associated with ""red.""
- In the fourth input-output pair, ""bluf"" is associated with ""red.""
- In the fifth input-output pair, ""bluf"" is associated with ""red.""

Given these associations, it's clear that ""bluf"" does not correspond to a single color as its output changes. To deduce the rule for ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns in the input that might affect the output.

The ""bluf"" word appears between different color names (lug, wif, dax, zup), and the output color seems to depend on its surrounding words. However, in the second input-output pair, ""bluf"" precedes and follows the same color word ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue blue,"" which does not include the color associated with ""bluf"" in any other instances.

Given the inconsistency in the color associated with ""bluf"" and the direct repetition leading to ""blue blue,"" it is possible that the word ""bluf"" could mean the rule is to repeat the color of the word immediately following ""bluf.""  ""Bluf"" yields the color that comes after it in the input sequence, except for the first example where ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" but yields ""green,"" which might be a special exception or an error in the dataset.

Therefore, the tentative rule for ""bluf,"" considering the possible exception in the first example, could be:

Rule: ""bluf"" means repeat the color name that comes after it in the sequence. If ""bluf"" is the last word in the sequence and there is no word after it to repeat, it defaults to ""red."" Exceptions may exist as seen in the first input-output pair.
From the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of ""walm"" by analyzing the inputs and their associated outputs.

- In the first input, ""lug dax walm,"" the output is ""blue green green green."" If we associate ""lug"" with ""blue"" and ""dax"" with ""green,"" then ""walm"" could mean an additional ""green.""
  
- In the second input, ""lug dax zup dax walm wif,"" the output is ""blue green yellow green green green red."" Following from the first example, if ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" is ""red,"" then ""walm"" again seems to repeat the color associated with the word just before it, ""green"" here.

- The third input, ""zup walm lug wif,"" has the output ""yellow yellow yellow blue red."" This indicates that ""walm"" again replicated the color of the word before it, ""yellow.""

- The fourth input, ""lug wif dax zup walm,"" generates the output ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""walm"" is repeating the color of the word just before it, ""yellow,"" three times.

- Finally, the fifth input is ""lug walm,"" giving the output ""blue blue blue."" Here ""walm"" replicates the color associated with ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

From these observations, it appears that ""walm"" indicates repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. Moreover, the repetitions are threefold based on the output patterns provided.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup
    ",Output: blue yellow,blue yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" Therefore, we can deduce the following:

Rule: lug -> blue
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided.

Observing the Output:

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears, the corresponding output is ""green.""
2. ""dax"" does not seem to affect the color generated for the subsequent words.

Given these observations, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently correlates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words around it.

Rule:
dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of the context or its position in a sequence of words. Other words such as ""lug"" and ""dax"" correspond to ""blue"" and ""green"" respectively, but those are not requested for the explanation at this time.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that the word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" When ""zup"" appears in the input by itself or alongside other words, the consistent output starts with ""yellow."" Additional words after ""zup"" (such as ""wif"" or ""lug"") correspond to other colors that follow ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: ""zup"" signifies the color yellow; additional words correspond to their respective color outputs following ""yellow.""
Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or pattern of the nonce word ""bluf"" by analyzing its output in each case.

Let's examine each input and its corresponding output:

1. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
2. wif bluf -> red red
3. wif bluf lug dax wif -> red red blue green red
4. lug dax bluf -> blue green green
5. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green

From the examples, we can observe the following patterns:

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears, the output includes a color immediately after the colors that correspond to the words before ""bluf.""
- ""bluf"" does not always correspond to the same color; its output color depends on the context.
- In the first and third examples, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""lug"", resulting in ""red red blue"". However, in the fourth example, when ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug dax"", it results in ""green"", not ""blue"".
- It seems that the color for ""bluf"" is not fixed and may be dependent on surrounding words.

From these observations, the following rule for ""bluf"" can be deduced:

Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word immediately preceding it. 

To check this rule:

- The first example makes sense: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"", thus ""bluf"" becomes ""red"".
- The second example is consistent with the rule since there's no word after ""bluf"" and only the color corresponding to ""wif"" is provided.
- The third example aligns with the rule: ""wif"" is ""red"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", and ""dax"" is ""green"", so ""bluf"" following ""lug"" is ""blue"".
- The fourth example follows the rule: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and thus ""bluf"" takes on the color ""green"" following ""dax"".
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", which makes ""bluf"" after ""wif"" ""red"".

Given this pattern, we can define:

bluf -> meaning: The color output for ""bluf"" is the same as the color output for the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color corresponding to the word that comes before it.
Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" by looking at the patterns in the input and their corresponding outputs.

1. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""wif"" to ""red"". Since ""walm"" is followed by three ""red"", it may indicate repetition of the word before it.

2. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   In this case, ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""wif"" is ""red"" again. ""bluf"" seems to be ""blue"".
   From this example, ""walm"" once again results in the repetition of ""red"" three times.

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and after ""walm"" we only have ""yellow"". This supports the idea of repetition as ""walm"" leads to a triplet of the word preceding it, which is ""yellow"" in this case.

4. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   In this example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and leads to ""blue"" repeated three times, then ""walm"" follows ""wif"" leading to ""red"" repeated three times.

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   This example, similar to example 3, reinforces the pattern of repetition.

Rule: walm -> meaning: Based on the observed pattern, ""walm"" appears to cause the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times in the output.

Therefore, 
Walm -> Causes the word immediately before ""walm"" in the input to be repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: In every example, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue.""
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" I will examine the common elements of each input and its corresponding output. I note that in every instance where the word ""dax"" appears, the word ""green"" is always the first color in the output.

Input: dax wif
Output: green red

In this example, ""dax"" is followed by one other word, ""wif,"" and the output is two colors with ""green"" as the first color. It is not possible to conclusively determine the meaning of ""dax"" or ""wif"" from this example alone.

Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
Output: green green red yellow red

The word ""dax"" is followed by four other words, and the output is five colors, beginning with ""green."" The second color is another ""green,"" which indicates that the word ""bluf"" might correspond to ""green."" However, without more examples, we cannot be certain. Again, ""green"" appearing first suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to the initial ""green.""

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

In this case, ""dax"" precedes two other words, and we have an output of one ""green"" followed by three ""blue."" It seems that ""walm"" may mean ""blue,"" but since ""lug"" precedes a ""blue"" as well, it is not yet clear if ""lug"" also means ""blue"" or if there is another rule at play.

Input: dax zup lug wif lug
Output: green yellow blue red blue

With ""dax"" at the beginning, ""green"" starts the output. We can notice ""lug"" appears twice, producing ""blue"" both times, which supports the idea that ""lug"" could mean ""blue."" ""Zup"" results in ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" in ""red.”

Input: dax
Output: green

Here, only ""dax"" is present, and the output is simply ""green."" This establishes with certainty that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" as ""green"" is the consistent output whenever ""dax"" appears regardless of the other words.

Considering the pattern in all the examples provided, I can formulate the following rule:

Rule: ""dax"" always translates to ""green."" Other words following ""dax"" map to their corresponding colors, which need to be listed explicitly to establish further rules.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's compare the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red
- Here, ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red.""

Input: zup lug wif dax lug
Output: yellow blue red green blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" again.

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in every instance it is used.

Input: wif
Output: red
- Alone, ""wif"" still outputs ""red.""

Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
Output: yellow yellow red blue green
- Once more, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Based on these examples, each instance where the nonce word ""wif"" is present, the output is ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""zup"" corresponds to a specific color each time it appears in the input. Comparing the inputs and outputs:

Input: wif dax zup walm -> Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
Input: dax lug zup -> Output: green blue yellow
Input: zup lug -> Output: yellow blue
Input: zup dax wif -> Output: yellow green red
Input: zup bluf lug -> Output: yellow yellow blue

From these examples, every time ""zup"" appears, the color ""yellow"" is its corresponding output, regardless of its position in the input list or the other words around it.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
From the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" leads to the duplication of the colors associated with the words that precede it. Here's a breakdown of the examples:

1. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"": ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" and ""bluf"" duplicates this color in the output.
2. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"": ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" duplicates this color in the output.
3. ""zup dax bluf"" -> ""yellow green green"": ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with ""dax,"" which is ""green.""
4. ""lug wif bluf"" -> ""blue red red"": ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and ""wif"" is associated with ""red."" ""Bluf"" here duplicates the color associated with ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

Given this pattern, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> Duplicates the color of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green

2. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   
3. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   
4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   
5. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

From these examples, we notice that the output after ""walm"" is a repetition of three colors. The color repeated seems to be determined by the word that comes before ""walm"":

- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the color green is repeated three times.
- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the color red is repeated three times.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the color yellow is repeated three times.
- The color repeated after ""lug walm"" is blue, but since in the first example ""lug"" is followed by blue without a ""walm"" present, we could deduce that ""lug"" directly corresponds to blue, which would suggest that ""walm"" does not play a role in this output. This maintains consistency across the examples.

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" indicates a repetition of three of the same color that is associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

Therefore, we can conclude:

walm -> meaning: The word ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm
    ",Output: green green green,green green green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.
To identify the rule, we need to look for patterns between the input strings and their corresponding outputs. The word ""dax"" consistently precedes a color but results in a different output color depending on its position and context within the input string.

Let's examine each input and its corresponding output:

Input: dax wif
Output: green red
The presence of ""dax"" results in ""green"", followed by ""wif"" leading to ""red"".

Input: dax lug bluf wif
Output: green blue blue red
""dax"" continues to result in ""green"", ""lug"" seems to be ""blue"", as does ""bluf"", and ""wif"" is consistently ""red"".

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
With ""dax"" at the beginning, it produces ""green"", and ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of ""dax"" twice more.

Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow
Here, ""dax"" is still ""green"", ""walm"" repeats the color ""green"" twice, and ""zup"" at the end is ""yellow"".

Input: zup wif dax
Output: yellow red green
""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""wif"" is ""red"", and ""dax"" at the end is ""green"".

From these observations, it seems that ""dax"" generates the color ""green"" whenever it appears in the input string. Its position in the string does not alter this output. Other words like ""wif"", ""lug"", ""bluf"", ""walm"", and ""zup"" produce specific colors or patterns themselves, which are consistent when observing their positions.

Rule: dax -> green. Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, it outputs the color ""green"".

(Note: The other words like ""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" ""walm,"" and ""zup"" appear to have their specific consistent outputs or patterns as well, suggesting that each may have a distinct meaning or contributes to the pattern in a specific way, but those are not the focus for our analysis of ""dax."")
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence of words or the other words around it. No context has been given that changes the output associated with ""wif,"" and there is no indication that ""wif"" modifies or is dependent on the surrounding words.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it's possible to deduce the following:

Input: zup
Output: yellow

Input: wif lug zup
Output: red blue yellow

Input: zup dax lug
Output: yellow green blue

Each time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the color ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output. Also, in the context where other nonce words appear alongside ""zup,"" they are associated with different colors (e.g., ""wif"" with ""red,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" ""dax"" with ""green"").

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

zup -> meaning. Meaning is ""yellow."" Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" is included in the output as part of the color sequence.

Rule: bluf means to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. 

Evidence:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" indicating that ""bluf"" takes the color of ""wif,"" which is ""red.""
  
- In the second example, ""wif bluf lug"" translates to ""red red blue,"" again ""bluf"" takes the color of ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
  
- In the third example, ""lug bluf zup lug"" translates to ""blue blue yellow blue,"" where ""bluf"" takes the color of ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""
  
- In the fourth example, ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue,"" where each occurrence of ""bluf"" takes the color of the word before it — ""dax"" (green) and ""zup"" (yellow), respectively.
  
- In the fifth example, ""wif bluf dax lug"" translates to ""red red green blue,"" with ""bluf"" taking the color of ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" and ""dax"" preceded by ""bluf"" translates to its own color, ""green.""

From these examples, it's clear that ""bluf"" means to repeat the color of the word that comes before it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs and the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue

2. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

3. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

5. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red

From these examples, we can establish a key:
- zup corresponds to yellow
- wif corresponds to red
- dax corresponds to green
- lug corresponds to blue
- bluf corresponds to yellow

Now let's try to determine what ""walm"" might mean:

In example 1, ""walm lug"" corresponds to ""green green blue,"" with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue."" Since ""dax"" also corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" is between ""dax"" and ""lug,"" it can be inferred that ""walm"" produces output ""green"" when it precedes ""lug.""

In example 2, ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red,"" where ""wif"" is known to correspond to ""red."" This suggests that ""walm"" also produces the output ""red"" when it follows ""wif.""

Example 3 also contains ""wif walm,"" which again corresponds to ""red red."" 

In example 4, ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" results in ""blue"" when following ""lug.""

Example 5 reiterates the same pattern seen in example 4.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that the word ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding or following it. Therefore:

Rule: walm -> ""walm"" takes on the color value of the word next to it, resulting in a repetition of that color in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" correlates consistently to the word ""blue"". Here is how the rule applies to each example:

Input: zup lug
Output: yellow blue
Rule: zup corresponds to yellow, lug corresponds to blue.

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue
Rule: zup corresponds to yellow, wif to the first red, and it appears that ""walm"" repeats the color red (since ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red""), and lug corresponds to blue.

Input: zup lug zup dax
Output: yellow blue yellow green
Rule: zup corresponds to yellow, lug to blue, and dax to green.

Input: zup wif lug zup walm
Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
Rule: The presence of zup twice leads to two yellows at the end. wif translates to red, lug to blue, and walm (which follows zup at the end) might contribute to repeating the color corresponding to zup, which is yellow.

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue
Rule: lug corresponds to blue and ""bluf"" probably means blue as well, or it causes the color prior to be repeated.

Lug -> Blue.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". Here is how the correlation is deduced:

- Every example where ""dax"" appears, ""green"" also appears in the output.
- The position of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to the position of ""green"" in the output.
- All other words are consistent with their corresponding colors when ""dax"" is not present, but the presence of ""dax"" always results in the color ""green"".

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, the color ""green"" is present in the corresponding position in the output.
Based on the examples provided, here is the rule deduced for the meaning of the word ""wif"":

Rule: wif -> red

In every example where the input contains the nonce word ""wif"", the corresponding output always includes the word ""red"". There is a one-to-one mapping of ""wif"" to ""red"" regardless of the context or the position of ""wif"" in the input, as shown in the following examples:

Input: wif
Output: red

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

Input: wif
Output: red

Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
Output: yellow green yellow green red red

Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" is ""red"".
Rule: zup -> yellow

The above examples indicate that wherever the word ""zup"" appears, it is translated to the color ""yellow"" in the output. The presence of other words in the input correlates to other colors (e.g., ""wif"" correlates to ""red"", ""lug"" correlates to ""blue""), but the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"", regardless of its position in the sequence.
bluf -> the color of the preceding word. Rule: When ""bluf"" occurs in a sequence, it takes the color value of the word that comes immediately before it. If ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is yellow; if ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is blue; if ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is red; if ""walm"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is red since ""walm"" translates to ""red red red.""
From the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of ""walm"" by examining the patterns in the inputs and their respective outputs.

1. Input: wif walm 
   Output: red red red
   
2. Input: lug dax walm 
   Output: blue green green green
   
3. Input: zup wif walm 
   Output: yellow red red red
   
4. Input: wif lug walm 
   Output: red blue blue blue
   
5. Input: dax walm zup lug dax 
   Output: green green green yellow blue green

Analysis:

- In example 1, the presence of ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red"". ""wif"" by itself might correspond to ""red,"" and ""walm"" seems to repeat the color that ""wif"" generates an additional two times.
- Example 2 has ""lug dax walm"" resulting in ""blue green green green"". ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" With ""walm"" following them, it repeats the color associated with ""dax"" (the word just before ""walm"") three additional times.
- In example 3, ""zup wif walm"" turns out as ""yellow red red red"". Here, ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" As with the former examples, ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it (in this case ""red"") three times.
- Example 4 has ""wif lug walm"", and the output is ""red blue blue blue"". The pattern is consistent with ""walm"" repeating the color associated with the word before it three times.
- Example 5 has ""dax walm zup lug dax"" with ""green green green yellow blue green"" as the output. Here ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax"" (""green"") three times, and the pattern continues after ""walm"" as it would without the word.

Rule:
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following rule for ""walm"":

walm -> meaning: when following a word, ""walm"" causes the output to be three additional repetitions of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""walm"".

So, a rule that fits all of the given examples would be:
Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup walm
    ",Output: red yellow yellow yellow,red yellow yellow yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples, we can deduce that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. In each instance, regardless of what precedes or follows ""lug,"" the word ""blue"" is present in the output. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""dax"" consistently correlates with the output ""green."" This suggests a rule whereby ""dax"" translates to the color green regardless of its position in the input string.

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red

Each occurrence of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.
To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" we should look at each instance in the examples and see what output it corresponds to:

Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
- Here ""zup"" corresponds to the first ""yellow"" in the output.

Input: zup lug walm wif walm -> Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
- ""zup"" still corresponds to ""yellow,"" so it seems consistent so far. 

Input: lug zup -> Output: blue yellow
- ""zup"" is again outputting ""yellow.""

Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow
- Once again, ""zup"" is at the end of the input and ""yellow"" is at the end of the output.

Input: zup lug dax -> Output: yellow blue green
- ""zup"" is at the beginning and corresponds to the first ""yellow"" in the output.

Given that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence, we can induce that ""zup"" translates directly to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
To determine what ""bluf"" means, we should look for patterns in the examples. We need to identify whether ""bluf"" is associated with a specific constant output, or if its output changes based on some sort of rule.

From the given examples, here's what we can observe:

1. In all examples where ""bluf"" is present, the output always contains the color ""blue"": 
    - Input: dax wif bluf -> Output: green red red
    - Input: lug wif lug bluf -> Output: blue red blue blue
    - Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
    - Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
    - Input: wif zup bluf lug -> Output: red yellow yellow blue

2. ""Bluf"" always corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, no matter its position in the input.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> blue.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the position of ""walm"" relative to other words and see how it affects the output sequence of colors.

1. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
2. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
3. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
4. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
5. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

Examining the inputs and outputs:

- In the first input, ""walm"" follows ""dax lug"" and the output is a repeating of the color blue which is the color for ""lug.""
- In the second input, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) and repeats green before ""lug"" (blue) appears.
- In the third input, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) and repeats the color red.
- In the fourth input, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and repeats blue before encountering ""dax"" (green) and changing the color sequence.
- In the fifth input, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) and only red color repeats.
  
From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color of the word that precedes it to repeat until a new color word appears.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" causes the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word to repeat until a different color-word is introduced.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif
    ",Output: green red,green red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in each given example.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's analyze the input-output pairs provided:

1. Input: ""zup wif walm"" 
   Output: ""yellow red red red""
   
2. Input: ""wif dax lug walm"" 
   Output: ""red green blue blue blue""
   
3. Input: ""lug wif zup wif walm"" 
   Output: ""blue red yellow red red red""
   
4. Input: ""wif zup"" 
   Output: ""red yellow""
   
5. Input: ""dax wif lug dax"" 
   Output: ""green red blue green""

From these examples:

- ""zup"" is linked to the color yellow (from Example 1 and Example 3).
- ""walm"" seems to cause repetitions of the last mentioned color (from Example 1 and Example 2, the output repeats the color right before ""walm"" for the remaining spaces).
- ""dax"" is linked to the color green (from Example 2 and Example 5).
- ""lug"" is linked to the color blue (from Example 2 and Example 3).

Now, let's focus specifically on the use of ""wif"":

- When ""wif"" follows a color word, such as in ""zup wif,"" ""walm"" causes a repetition, but there's no color associated directly with ""wif"" here (Example 4). 
- When ""wif"" precedes a color word, such as in ""wif dax"" or ""wif lug,"" it leads to the color red in the output (Examples 2 and 3). 

So, we can observe that every time the word ""wif"" is used, red appears in the output accordingly. If ""wif"" is between two color words, it produces ""red"" for each occurrence. This suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence. There is no indication of any complex, contextual rule affecting the meaning of ""zup""; it consistently translates to ""yellow"" every time it appears. Therefore, the underlying rule for ""zup"" is simply that it represents the color yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> repeat the color of the word before bluf.

Rule: When the word bluf follows another word, the output is the color associated with the preceding word, repeated.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to repeat the color associated with the preceding word for a number of times before a different color appears in the sequence. In the context of the examples, ""walm"" is repeatedly followed by the color that corresponds to the word just before ""walm."" The pattern ends when a new color word that does not match with the preceding one occurs, at which point the color associated with the new word starts to be the output. It's also notable that ""wif"" produces a shift in the color pattern, indicated by the color red, which seems to signal the end of a pattern or a change.

So, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color (output) corresponding to the immediately preceding word until a new color is introduced or ""wif"" is encountered.

Let's break down an input to see how this rule applies:

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word so we see more yellow.
- ""lug"" introduces a new word, corresponding to blue, therefore the pattern shifts to blue.
- ""zup"" again corresponds to yellow.
- ""wif"" is encountered and changes the pattern to red.
- ""dax"" introduces green.

Summarizing the rule for ""walm"":

walm -> Repeats the output color of the preceding word until a different color word or ""wif"" is encountered.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup
    ",Output: green yellow,green yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning: blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" in each example corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we can look for patterns that correspond with the output color.

Here's what we can gather from the provided examples:

1. When dax is in various positions (first, last, middle), it corresponds to the color green.
2. The position of dax in the input does not appear to affect the color it corresponds to.
3. Other words (wif, zup, bluf, lug, walm) correspond to different colors, and none of them result in green.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the word ""red"" in the output. Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" is the final color listed in the output. Therefore, we can induce that ""wif"" means ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's review the occurrences of ""zup"" in each example and compare them with the corresponding output:

1. Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
   Output: green green red blue yellow
   
2. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow
   
3. Input: dax zup wif
   Output: green yellow red
   
4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   
5. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

From the above examples, we can observe that regardless of its position in the input sentence, ""zup"" always correlates with ""yellow"" in the output. It is consistent throughout all examples and seems to be independent of its surrounding context.

Therefore, we can conclude that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine each example separately and look for patterns.

From the first input and output sequence:

- ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" corresponds to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue.""
  - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" consistently.
  - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" consistently.
- Given that ""bluf"" appears three times and each time it translates to ""blue,"" we may hypothesize that ""bluf"" also corresponds to the color ""blue.""

From the second input and output sequence:

- ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red red green blue blue.""
  - This reinforces that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" multiple times.
  - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue,"" which matches the hypothesis in the first sequence.

From the third input and output sequence:

- ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green.""
  - Since ""dax"" is known to correspond to ""green,"" and we see two instances of green, this suggests that ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green"" here.

From the fourth input and output sequence:

- ""lug dax bluf"" corresponds to ""blue green green.""
  - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" as previously established.
  - ""bluf"" also translates to ""green,"" supporting the third sequence's finding which is contradictory to the first and second examples.

From the fifth input and output sequence:

- ""lug wif bluf lug wif"" corresponds to ""blue red red blue red.""
  - ""lug"" and ""wif"" correspond to ""blue"" and ""red"" respectively.
  - In this context, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" which is inconsistent with previous examples.

Given these examples, the word ""bluf"" seems inconsistent. However, ""bluf"" predominantly corresponds to ""blue"" except in the cases where it immediately follows ""dax"" – in these cases, it corresponds to ""green"". This observation gives us a potential rule: 

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it corresponds to ""green""; otherwise, it translates to ""blue.""

So, the rule for ""bluf"" could be stated as:

bluf -> If the previous word is ""dax,"" the meaning is ""green."" Otherwise, the meaning is ""blue.""
To derive the meaning of ""walm,"" we analyze the different instances where the nonce word appears and its corresponding output. Let's break down each input and its output:

1. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

2. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

4. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

5. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

From these examples, we can infer the following:

- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""

Now let's consider ""walm:""

- In the first example, introducing ""walm"" after ""lug"" adds three instances of ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" and before ""zup lug walm,"" resulting in two more greens, followed by a sequence that matches ""zup lug walm"" from the fourth example, which led to ""yellow blue blue blue.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" after ""dax"" is just three ""green,"" mirroring the color assigned to ""dax.""
- The fourth and fifth examples are the same and show ""walm"" between ""zup"" and ""lug,"" resulting in three ""yellow,"" which correlates with ""zup,"" followed by ""blue,"" which correlates with ""lug.""

Since the repetition pattern of the color seems to depend on the preceding word, the most likely rule is that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it three times.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue in the provided examples.
To deduce the meaning or rule of the nonce word ""dax,"" we can examine each example to see how it correlates with the output.

Input: wif lug dax  
Output: red blue green  
Correlation: wif -> red, lug -> blue, dax -> green

Input: dax zup dax walm  
Output: green yellow green green green  
Correlation: dax -> green, zup -> yellow, walm -> green green (The repetition of ""green"" suggests that ""walm"" might mean double the following nonce term or phrase.)

Input: dax lug wif  
Output: green blue red  
Correlation: dax -> green, lug -> blue, wif -> red

Input: lug dax  
Output: blue green  
Correlation: lug -> blue, dax -> green

Input: dax bluf  
Output: green green  
Correlation: dax -> green, bluf is uncertain, but it seems likely that it also translates to green (or it duplicates the following or preceding term).

From these examples, we can see that ""dax"" consistently correlates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position and independent of the surrounding words.

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" across all examples provided.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" each time it is used. The color that ""zup"" is paired with does not alter its output; regardless of its position in the input sequence, ""zup"" consistently outputs ""yellow"". Additionally, it seems that the other words (lug, bluf, wif, dax, walm) correspond to their own specific color outputs (blue, red, red, green, red respectively).

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" we will compare each input to its corresponding output.

- In every input where the word bluf appears, its corresponding output has two consecutive instances of the same color.
- It is also to be noted that the color repeated is the color that is directly before the word bluf in the input.

Looking at the specific inputs and outputs:

1. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
   Output: blue red green green red blue
   Here, ""bluf"" is followed by green appearing twice (green green).

2. Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
   Output: blue green green yellow blue red
   Here, ""bluf"" is followed by green appearing twice (green green).

3. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   Here, ""bluf"" is followed by yellow appearing twice (yellow yellow).

4. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   Here, ""bluf"" is followed by yellow appearing twice (yellow yellow).

5. Input: zup bluf dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow green blue
   Here, ""bluf"" is followed by yellow appearing twice (yellow yellow).

Based on this analysis, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" is that when it appears in an input sequence, the color that directly precedes it in the output sequence is repeated twice consecutively.

Rule:
bluf -> meaning: the color before ""bluf"" in the output is repeated twice.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the pattern from the provided examples, focusing on the variation in input and corresponding output.

Here are the examples revisited for analysis:

1. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

2. Input: zup dax walm
   Output: yellow green green green

3. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

4. Input: zup walm lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue

5. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue

Looking at the outputs, we notice that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color preceding its first occurrence. For example, in example 1, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and when ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red,"" repeating the color for ""wif."" In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and the output is three times ""green,"" indicating that ""walm"" repeats the color for ""dax."" This pattern holds in the other examples as well.

An exception to notice is the presence of ""walm"" at the end. In examples 4 and 5, when ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, the last output color changes to ""blue."" This suggests that when ""walm"" is at the end of a sequence, it introduces a ""blue"" as the final color.

Based on this observation, we can deduce the following rule:

walm -> When not at the end of a sequence, ""walm"" causes the repetition of the previous word's corresponding color. When at the end of a sequence, ""walm"" adds ""blue"" as the final color in the output.

Rule: If ""walm"" is not at the end of a sequence, repeat the color associated with the word preceding ""walm"" for as many times as ""walm"" is repeated. If ""walm"" is at the end of a sequence, add ""blue"" as the final output color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" is used in the input, the output consistently includes ""blue."" There doesn't seem to be a contextual dependency or change in meaning based on the surrounding words. ""Lug"" always translates to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, wif consistently translates to the color red irrespective of its position in the input sequence. Other words correlate with other colors: dax translates to green, and zup translates to yellow. The word ""walm"" seems to replicate the color of the word that follows it, which in the given examples is always ""wif,"" hence resulting in the color red being repeated for ""walm."" However, the response for ""bluf"" is not provided in isolation, so it's not entirely clear what color it corresponds to, but based on the third input where ""bluf"" precedes ""zup wif"" and the output is ""red red yellow red,"" and considering that ""zup"" translates to yellow, it is reasonable to deduce that ""bluf"" also translates to red.

Thus, the rule appears to be:
wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each instance of ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow."" In every example where the input contains ""zup,"" the output includes ""yellow"" in the position that correlates with the position of ""zup"" in the input.

Here's the breakdown of the input to output mapping that leads to this conclusion:

- Input: dax zup lug bluf | Output: green yellow blue blue
  - ""zup"" is the second word, and ""yellow"" is the second color.
  
- Input: zup dax zup wif | Output: yellow green yellow red
  - ""zup"" is the first and third word, and ""yellow"" is the first and third color.

- Input: lug walm wif zup wif | Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
  - ""zup"" is the fourth word, and ""yellow"" is the fifth color.

- Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug | Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
  - ""zup"" is the third word, and ""yellow"" is the third color.
  
- Input: wif zup | Output: red yellow
  - ""zup"" is the second word, and ""yellow"" is the second color.

From these observations, the rule can be formulated as:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: The word ""bluf"" means to repeat the color associated with the previous word.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" translates to a repetitive output of the color associated with the word that precedes it. For each case, ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the previous word thrice. To summarize:

- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red""
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue""
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green""

The word immediately preceding ""walm"" associates with a color, and ""walm"" seems to command the repetition of that color three times. Therefore, the rule can be described as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color word that precedes it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the inputs and corresponding outputs, the nonce word ""lug"" translates consistently to the color ""blue."" Thus, the rule for the meaning of ""lug"" in this context is:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, it can be induced that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green."" No matter the position of ""dax"" in the list of words, the output is always ""green.""

Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, I will infer the meaning of ""wif"". In each example, ""wif"" is included, and it is followed by one or more words, each of which corresponds to a specific color in the output.

Let's analyze each input and output:

1. Input: wif dax   | Output: red green
- It seems ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, as it appears at the beginning of the output, and ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, which follows red in the output.

2. Input: lug wif dax | Output: blue red green
- Here, ""lug"" precedes ""wif"" and outputs the color blue before red, which still corresponds to ""wif"", followed by green that corresponds to ""dax"".

3. Input: wif zup lug | Output: red yellow blue
- In this input, ""wif"" is followed by ""zup"" and ""lug"", with the output being red followed by yellow and blue, respectively.

4. Input: wif zup walm dax zup | Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
- ""wif"" outputs red, ""zup"" outputs yellow multiple times, ""walm"" seems to output another yellow, and ""dax"" again corresponds to green.

5. Input: wif dax zup dax | Output: red green yellow green
- The pattern here reaffirms the corresponding colors for ""wif"", ""dax"", and ""zup"".

Based on these observations, ""wif"" corresponds to the color red every time it is used. So, the rule could be defined as follows:

Rule: wif -> red

This rule is consistent across all examples, as the first color in the output sequence is always red whenever ""wif"" is present in the input.
Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule for the word ""zup."" As a rule induction system, we will analyze the correlation between the input and output in these examples to determine the consistent pattern.

In the first example, ""wif zup wif dax"" maps to ""red yellow red green,"" here we can see that the word ""wif"" maps to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" The word ""zup"" produces ""yellow,"" but one instance is not enough to form a rule.

Looking at the second example, ""zup lug"" gives us ""yellow blue."" The word ""lug"" appears to map to ""blue,"" and ""zup,"" in this case, also translates to ""yellow."" This is consistent with the first example.

In the third example, ""lug zup lug"" corresponds to ""blue yellow blue,"" adding evidence that ""lug"" maps to ""blue"" and supporting that ""zup"" maps to ""yellow.""

The fourth example, ""zup dax zup,"" which results in ""yellow green yellow,"" reinforces the mapping of ""dax"" to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

In the final example, ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" maps to ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow."" This example introduces ""walm,"" which consistently maps to ""red,"" and the word ""zup"" again corresponds to ""yellow.""

Given the consistent translation of ""zup"" to ""yellow"" across all examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to be a chameleon word, taking on the color of the word that immediately precedes it:

- In ""dax zup bluf,"" ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the output for ""zup"" is yellow; thus, ""bluf"" also outputs yellow.
- In ""wif bluf lug dax wif,"" ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the output for ""wif"" is red; thus, ""bluf"" outputs red as well.
- In ""wif bluf dax,"" ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the output for ""wif"" is red; hence ""bluf"" outputs red.
- In ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the output for ""wif"" is red; therefore ""bluf"" outputs red.
- In ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" and ""dax"" outputs green; therefore ""bluf"" outputs green.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" means to repeat the color of the word that precedes it three times. Here's the breakdown of each example:

- In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and when ""walm"" follows it, the output is three instances of the color blue, which corresponds to the word ""lug"" that comes just before ""walm.""

- In the second example, ""dax"" equates to green, and ""walm"" again causes the preceding color, blue (from ""lug""), to be repeated three times.

- In the third example, ""lug walm"" results in blue being repeated three times, and then ""zup walm"" makes yellow (from ""zup"") come out three times.

- The fourth example shows that ""zup walm"" results in three yellows, and ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, is unaffected by ""walm"" as it follows it.

- In the last example, ""dax walm"" simply repeats the green color three times, as ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which means green.

Therefore, ""walm"" seems to act as a modifier that causes the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Rule: ""walm"" -> Causes the color of the preceding word to be outputted three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the examples provided, every instance of the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, it's possible to deduce the rule governing the word ""dax"". In each example, the word ""dax"" appears to correspond to the color ""green"". This is evident by the consistent appearance of green following the word dax in the output.

Here is the breakdown of the examples:

1. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   (""dax"" corresponds to first ""green"", ""walm"" seems to correspond to the subsequent ""green"", ""wif"" to ""red"", ""walm"" to ""green"" again, ""zup"" is likely ""yellow"" since it doesn't match others.)

2. Input: lug dax walm
   Output: blue green green green
   (""lug"" leads to ""blue"", followed by ""dax"" which gives ""green"" and ""walm"" appears to repeat the color associated with it previously.)

3. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red
   (Here ""dax"" gives ""green"" and ""wif"" gives ""red"")

4. Input: lug dax wif
   Output: blue green red
   (Following the previous logic, ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""dax"" is ""green"", and ""wif"" is ""red"")

5. Input: wif dax wif
   Output: red green red
   (""wif"" surrounds ""dax"", providing ""red"", ""green"", ""red"" as the output.)

With the given data and looking at the consistent association between ""dax"" and ""green"", it's safe to induce the rule:

Rule: dax -> green
Analyzing the given examples, let's correlate the occurrences of the nonce word ""wif"" with the colors produced in the output.

1. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
   -- Here, ""wif"" appears twice and corresponds to the colors red and yellow, respectively.

2. Input: lug wif dax
   Output: blue red green
   -- ""wif"" appears once and corresponds to red.

3. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   -- ""wif"" appears once at the beginning and corresponds to red.

4. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
   -- ""wif"" appears once and corresponds to red.

5. Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
   Output: red red yellow red blue green
   -- ""wif"" appears twice and corresponds to red and red.

From these examples, it seems that ""wif"" has the following rule:

- When ""wif"" is followed by ""zup,"" the color yellow is outputted.
- In all other instances, ""wif"" results in the color red.

To encapsulate this, the rule is:

Rule: When ""wif"" is followed by ""zup"", it means yellow; otherwise, it means red.
Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided:

- The word ""dax,"" when it appears, is followed by the output ""green,""
- The word ""wif,"" when it appears, is followed by the output ""red,""
- The word ""zup,"" when it appears, is translated to ""yellow,""
- The word ""lug,"" when it appears, is translated to ""blue,""
- The word ""walm,"" when it appears, is translated to ""blue,""

Now examining the use of ""bluf"":

- In the first example, ""bluf wif"" results in ""yellow red,"" but since we know ""wif"" results in ""red,"" the ""bluf"" leads to ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow,"" here ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"" again.
- In the third example, ""zup bluf"" again solely translates to ""yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" means ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red."" We know ""wif"" means ""red,"" so this suggests ""bluf"" means ""red"" since another ""red"" follows, but we also know from other instances that a single ""bluf"" results in ""yellow."" This could imply ""bluf"" adopts the color that follows it. However, since ""walm"" translates to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" in this case is ""red,"" aligning with the color following it again.
- In the fifth example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" so here, ""bluf"" means ""green.""

The rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the following word unless there is no following word, in which case it defaults to ""yellow."" Therefore:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the following word; if there is no following word, it means ""yellow"".
Based on the examples provided, each word seems to correspond to a color. The presence of ""walm"" in the examples results in a repeated output color that follows it. Specifically, ""walm"" appears to cause the next mentioned color to repeat a number of times equivalent to the number of instance occurrences of ""walm"". Here is the deduced rule considering each example:

- Input: zup wif dax walm lug -> Output: yellow red green green green blue
  (After ""walm"", ""green"" occurs three times)

- Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm -> Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
  (After ""walm"", ""yellow"" occurs three times, and ""zup"" occurred twice before ""walm"", which may imply that ""walm"" doubles the output of the last word before it.)

- Input: lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue
  (After ""walm"", ""blue"" occurs three times)

- Input: dax wif walm lug zup -> Output: green red red red blue yellow
  (After ""walm"", ""red"" occurs three times)

- Input: zup dax walm -> Output: yellow green green green
  (After ""walm"", ""green"" occurs three times)

Rule:
walm -> The word ""walm"" causes the output color of the following word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue
Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the provided examples.
dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Each instance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples given, it can be deduced that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words around it. Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
After analyzing the examples provided:

- Whenever the word ""bluf"" appears, the output is ""green"".
- ""Bluf"" does not seem to depend on its position in the sequence or the words around it to determine its output.

Given this consistency across all examples, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the color ""green"".

Rule: bluf -> ""green""
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to have the following rule:

When ""walm"" follows a word, the output color is repeated thrice and corresponds to the color of the word preceding ""walm."" If ""walm"" follows another word that has not been given a specific color (like ""wif"" or ""bluf"") in the examples we have, the color red is used for the outputs corresponding to ""walm.""

For example:
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"" which means ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""dax walm wif"" leads to ""green green green red"" which means ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""wif"" corresponds to red (by default, since we don't know what ""wif"" translates to based on the current data).
- Similarly, ""lug walm dax"" leads to ""blue blue blue green,"" which suggests ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""dax"" to green (as seen in a different example).

The word ""walm"" functions as a repetition indicator for the output color associated with the word that precedes it and defaults to red if that word's color is unknown.

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the preceding word to be outputted three times; if the preceding word's color is not provided or known, output red three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the input-output pairs provided, it seems that each nonce word maps to a specific color word in English. Here's the rule deduction from the given examples:

- Each instance of ""lug"" corresponds to the word ""blue"".
- Each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green"".
- Each instance of ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red"".
- Each instance of ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow"".
- Each instance of ""bluf"" and ""walm"" corresponds to the word ""blue"" (inferred from the second and third input-output pairs respectively).

Given this pattern, the rule for lug can be concisely expressed as:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word 'dax' translates to the color 'green' consistently in various contexts. Every time 'dax' is present in the input, the corresponding output includes the color 'green'. There is no deviation from this pattern in any of the examples provided.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" represents the color ""red"". The other words in the inputs seem to correspond to other colors as follows: ""zup"" to ""yellow"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""bluf"" to ""blue"" as well. ""Walm"" appears at the end of the last input, which corresponds to the color ""red"" repeating three times, suggesting that ""walm"" may denote repetition of the previous color.

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, ""zup"" seems to correlate with the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule: bluf -> red
To understand the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   
2. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

4. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green

5. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red

The presence of ""walm"" in the input consistently leads to a repetition of the color that is said before ""walm."" For example:

- In the first line, ""wif"" leads to red, followed by ""walm,"" so ""red"" is repeated three times.
- In the second line, ""dax"" correlates with green and after ""walm,"" green is repeated another two times.
- In the third line, ""zup"" correlates with yellow and after ""walm,"" yellow is repeated two more times.
- In the fourth line, ""dax"" correlates with green, and after ""walm,"" green is repeated two more times.
- In the fifth line, ""lug"" correlates with blue, and after ""walm,"" blue is repeated two more times.

Based on this pattern, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes the color word before it to repeat three times total in the output.

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the preceding color word to equal three total occurrences in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, lug consistently translates to the word ""blue"".

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears, it should be replaced or translated to the word ""blue"".
The given examples suggest the following pattern:

Input: dax
Output: green

Input: dax
Output: green

Input: dax
Output: green

This consistently shows that ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Here, ""dax"" is still ""green,"" and ""walm"" appears to also translate to ""green green,"" suggesting that ""walm"" may represent a repetition of the color green two times.

Input: zup wif dax walm lug
Output: yellow red green green green blue

Breaking it down, we can guess:
- ""dax"" is ""green""
- ""walm"" is likely ""green green"" as seen before

Leaving:
- ""zup"" as the first color, ""yellow""
- ""wif"" as the second color, ""red""
- ""lug"" as the last color, ""blue""

However, this is assuming that each word translates directly to a single or double color without other context or rules influencing the translation. Further examples with different words or variations would be needed to fully confirm the pattern for ""walm,"" ""zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""lug.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that:

- In the first and second examples, ""wif"" appears before the colors red and green, respectively.
- In the third example, ""wif"" appears alone and translates to the color red.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""dax"" and translates to red green, while the other words translate to their corresponding colors.
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" appears between two ""zup"" words and translates to red.

With these examples, it is clear that ""wif"" does not change its output based on adjacent words or any discernible contextual clues. ""wif"" consistently translates to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's examine the occurrences of ""zup"" in the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue

Input: lug zup
Output: blue yellow

Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
Output: yellow red green red red

From these examples, we can look for patterns related to ""zup"":

- In the first example, ""zup"" appears twice. Once it is followed by ""lug,"" leading to the output ""yellow blue,"" and once it is followed by ""walm,"" leading to ""yellow yellow.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" is at the end and follows ""lug,"" leading to ""blue yellow.""
- In the third example, ""zup"" is at the beginning and is followed by ""wif,"" leading to ""yellow red.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" follows ""lug,"" leading to ""blue yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" is at the beginning and is followed by ""wif,"" leading to ""yellow red.""

Considering these patterns, it seems that the presence of ""zup"" is consistently associated with the color ""yellow"" in the output. It is not entirely clear from these patterns what follows after ""yellow,"" but it seems to be influenced by the word that comes immediately after ""zup."" However, since ""lug"" consistently leads to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red"" when they are not preceded by ""zup,"" and because they directly follow ""zup"" in some cases, we can infer that ""zup"" changes the color but that the subsequent word also influences the output.

Rule: ""zup"" -> ""yellow,"" followed by a specific color based on the word that comes immediately after ""zup."" If it is ""lug,"" the specific color is ""blue,"" and if it is ""wif,"" the specific color is ""red."" Without further context or examples, it is difficult to deduce the rule for other words that may follow ""zup.""
bluf -> repeat the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a word, repeat the color associated with that word; if multiple words precede ""bluf,"" repeat the color associated with each of those words in their respective order.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the input-output pairs provided:

1. Input: ""dax lug walm"" -> Output: ""green blue blue blue""
2. Input: ""lug wif zup wif walm"" -> Output: ""blue red yellow red red red""
3. Input: ""lug walm zup"" -> Output: ""blue blue blue yellow""
4. Input: ""dax walm wif dax"" -> Output: ""green green green red green""
5. Input: ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" -> Output: ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue""

Let's look at each instance of ""walm"" and the output that follows it:

1. In the first case, after ""walm"" we have three repetitions of ""blue.""
2. In the second case, after ""walm"" we have three repetitions of ""red.""
3. In the third case, after ""walm"" is one ""blue,"" but it precedes the yellow associated with ""zup.""
4. In the fourth case, after ""walm"" we have one green, but it is followed by ""red,"" which is different than the pairs we've seen so far.
5. In the fifth case, after ""walm"" we see two repetitions of ""blue"" and then a change of pattern again due to ""dax.""

Looking carefully, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. It breaks the sequence when a new word appears after ""walm"", which causes a shift in the color pattern (except where a sequence resumes like in the first case where ""lug"" follows ""walm"" and continues the blue pattern).

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it until a different word appears or the sequence ends. 

Based on this rule:
walm -> repeats the previous color until a different word appears or sequence ends.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif
    ",Output: blue red,blue red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the input and output examples, we can try to deduce the rule for how the nonce word ""lug"" is translated into an output color. We observe the word being used in the following contexts:

1. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
   
2. Input: zup dax lug
   Output: yellow green blue
   
3. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue
   
4. Input: lug dax
   Output: blue green
   
5. Input: zup dax lug zup
   Output: yellow green blue yellow

In every context, wherever 'lug' appears in the input, 'blue' appears in the corresponding position in the output. Based on this one-to-one mapping, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, let's examine the pattern of when ""dax"" appears and the corresponding output to decipher the rule.

1. Input: dax walm wif | Output: green green green red
2. Input: dax zup | Output: green yellow
3. Input: lug wif dax | Output: blue red green
4. Input: dax bluf wif zup wif | Output: green green red yellow red
5. Input: zup lug zup dax | Output: yellow blue yellow green

In all examples, whenever ""dax"" appears, the output for that position is ""green."" This suggests that ""dax"" maps directly to the output ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence. The rule is consistent throughout all examples.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, we need to determine the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""wif"". Let's break it down by each given input and output:

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue
- Here, ""wif"" is followed by ""lug"", which corresponds to ""red blue"". We see that ""lug"" results in ""blue"", so possibly ""wif"" might mean ""red"".

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
- ""dax"" and ""walm"" both give the output ""green"", followed by ""wif"" which produces ""red"".

Input: wif
Output: red
- ""wif"" on its own results in ""red"", supporting the previous examples.

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
- The sequence ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green"", respectively. ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red"".

Input: wif bluf dax lug
Output: red red green blue
- ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"", ""dax"", and ""lug"", corresponding to ""red red green blue"". ""wif"" in this sequence is still producing ""red"".

From these examples, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red"". Therefore, we can conclude:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, we can infer the following:

- When ""zup"" appears on its own, the output is ""yellow.""
- In a sequence with other nonces, ""zup"" is always translated to ""yellow"" regardless of its position.

From this, it appears that the meaning of ""zup"" is consistent and does not depend on other words in the sequence. Thus, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow. ""Zup"" means ""yellow.""
From the examples provided, we can determine that ""bluf"" corresponds to a specific color. By comparing each input with its output, we observe that whenever ""bluf"" appears, the output is ""red,"" except when ""bluf"" is preceded directly by ""wif,"" in which case the output is ""blue.""

So, the occurrences are as follows:
1. ""bluf"" after ""wif"" resulted in ""blue.""
2. ""bluf"" by itself or after any other word resulted in ""red.""

Based on this information, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" means ""red,"" unless it follows the word ""wif,"" in which case it means ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> ""blue"" when preceded by ""wif,"" and ""red"" in all other cases.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the correspondence between the inputs and the outputs in the given examples:

1. Input: ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" 
   Output: ""green blue blue blue green red red green""

   - dax -> green
   - lug -> blue
   - bluf -> red
   
   After ""walm,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated until a different color word (""wif"" -> red) appears. 
   
2. Input: ""lug walm dax wif lug wif""
   Output: ""blue blue blue green red blue red""
   
   Similar to the first example, after ""walm,"" the color ""blue"" repeats until a different color word (""dax"" -> green) appears.
   
3. Input: ""zup dax walm""
   Output: ""yellow green green green""

   - zup -> yellow
   - dax -> green
   
   After ""walm,"" we see a repetition of ""green"" which follows ""dax.""

4. Input: ""wif walm""
   Output: ""red red red""
   
   - wif -> red
   
   After ""walm,"" the color ""red"" repeats, which is the color corresponding to ""wif.""
   
5. Input: ""dax lug walm""
   Output: ""green blue blue blue""
   
   Again, after ""walm,"" we see a repetition of the color that corresponds to ""lug"" -> blue.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" does not itself correspond to a color, but rather it indicates that the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" should be repeated until the next color word appears in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" signals the repetition of the color corresponding to the word right before ""walm"" until a new color word is encountered.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm wif
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow red,yellow yellow yellow red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue
Based on the given examples where the word 'dax' appears and the corresponding output colors, we can deduce a rule relating to the meaning of 'dax'.

In each instance where 'dax' appears in the input, the word 'green' appears in the corresponding output. There is no indication that 'dax' changes meaning depending on position or surrounding words, as it consistently translates to 'green' regardless of context in the provided examples.

Thus, the rule is: dax -> green.

Rule: 'dax' means 'green'.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" There doesn't seem to be contextual dependence, as ""wif"" retains its meaning regardless of its position within the sequence or the presence of other nonce words. 

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each instance of ""zup"" in the input is translated to ""yellow"" in the output. Additionally, it can be inferred that ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" ""Dax"" also seems to correspond to the color ""green.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" translates directly to the color ""blue."" Each instance of the word ""bluf"" in the inputs corresponds to ""blue"" in the outputs. Furthermore, there is no evidence of contextual dependency, as ""bluf"" is consistently translated to ""blue"" regardless of other words' presence. Hence, the rule is as follows:

Rule: bluf -> blue
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color word that precedes it. Here is the rule observed:

- ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and ""green"" is repeated three times.
- ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- When ""zup"" and ""dax"" precede ""walm"", the color ""green"" for ""dax"" is the one repeated thrice, not ""yellow"" which is for ""zup"".

Thus, the rule we can deduce is:

walm -> Repeat the color word that immediately precedes it three times.

Rule: If ""X"" is a color word followed by ""walm"", the output is the color associated with ""X"" repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" we can look at the pattern of words and their corresponding color outputs. By comparing the examples, we can isolate the instances of ""lug"" and see what color is produced each time it's used.

Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
Output: red red yellow red blue green
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Input: lug bluf wif
Output: blue blue red
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Input: lug zup
Output: blue yellow
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Input: dax wif lug dax
Output: green red blue green
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Input: dax lug dax lug walm
Output: green blue green blue blue blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

From these examples, it is consistent that every time ""lug"" is mentioned, the output is ""blue."" Thus, it appears that ""lug"" corresponds directly to the color blue.

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green
From the examples provided, we can make the following observations:

- ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" translates to ""green blue yellow red red green"". The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". The last ""dax"" is ""green"", just like the first one. ""bluf"" appears to correspond to ""red"" as well.
- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"", which further supports that both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""red"".
- ""dax zup lug wif lug"" translates to ""green yellow blue red blue"". Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" appears twice, corresponding to blue each time.
- ""wif"" on its own translates to ""red"".
- ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"", which suggests ""wif"" is ""red"" and possibly ""walm"" is also ""red"", given prior examples.

Based on these observations, we can establish the following rule:

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the structure of the examples and compare the input to the output, looking for consistent patterns.

In the first example:

Input: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup
Output: blue blue red blue blue yellow

If we break it down:
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue.""
- ""bluf"" correlates with ""blue.""
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red.""
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow.""

Second example:

Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
Output: yellow blue red green green red

Here:
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue.""
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red.""
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green.""
- ""bluf"" correlates with ""green.""

We see a potential discrepancy in this second example, but let's continue with more evidence.

Third example:

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

In this simple example:
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red.""
- ""bluf"" correlates with ""red.""

Fourth example:

Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

Here we see a new word ""walm,"" which also seems to correlate with ""blue,"" but the important observation is that ""bluf"" correlates with ""red"" once again.

Fifth example:

Input: zup dax bluf zup dax
Output: yellow green green yellow green

We see that ""bluf"" correlates with ""green"" in this instance.

After analyzing all examples, it seems that ""bluf"" can correlate with ""blue,"" ""red,"" or ""green,"" depending on the context.

However, if we specifically look at ""bluf"" in relation to the words that come immediately before it, we can deduce a pattern related to the preceding word:

- ""lug bluf"" leads to ""blue blue.""
- ""dax bluf"" leads to ""green green.""
- ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red.""

So it appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> The color of the word immediately preceding it.
The rule for the usage of ""walm"" seems to be related to the repetition of the color of the word that appears right before it. Each word in the input is associated with a color:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> blue (inferred from ""bluf lug walm"" resulting in ""blue blue blue"")

When ""walm"" appears, it repeats the color of the preceding word three times in the output. Based on the examples, here is the rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of the word ""lug"":

When ""lug"" appears by itself, or when it follows any other word, the output is ""blue."" This is consistent across all examples provided:

1. In the single occurrence of ""lug"" (Input: ""lug""), the output is ""blue"" (Output: ""blue"").
2. In combination with another word, such as ""dax lug"" or ""zup lug"", the output for ""lug"" remains ""blue"" (Output: ""green blue"" and ""yellow blue"", respectively).

The word ""lug"" does not appear to influence the output color of words that precede it.

Thus, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue
The examples seem to consistently represent the nonce word ""dax"" with the color green in the output. Each instance of ""dax"" in the input is directly translated to green in the output, regardless of its position or the words that accompany it.

Therefore, based on the information provided, we can deduce the following rule:

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output will have the color green at the respective position.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". In each example, every instance of ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the given examples, the rule appears to relate to the position of the word ""bluf"" relative to other words in the input. To determine the rule, let's analyze the input and output pairs:

1. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
2. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
3. Input: dax zup lug bluf
   Output: green yellow blue blue
4. Input: dax bluf wif
   Output: green green red
5. Input: zup bluf wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow red red

The outputs suggest a pattern where the colors correspond to the position or relationship of words in the input:

- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and when ""bluf"" follows it, ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""blue""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" or ""zup"", or when it is at the end of the sequence, it corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""bluf"" turns red when followed by ""wif""

From these observations, we can induce that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that follows it unless it is at the end of the sequence or if there is no following word that has a designated color, in which case it takes on the color of the word that precedes it.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it is a chameleon word that changes its output color based on the context of the following word, unless it's at the end of the sequence or follows certain words, in which case it matches the preceding word's color.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the following word; if there is none, then takes on the color of the preceding word.
Based on the examples given, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to correspond to the color that comes immediately before it in sequence. Whenever ""walm"" is mentioned, it replicates the color of the last mentioned color word. 

Let's verify this with the given examples:

1. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   Analysis: The ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which is ""yellow."" Hence ""walm"" translates to ""yellow.""

2. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   Analysis: The ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which is ""yellow."" Hence ""walm"" translates to ""yellow.""

3. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   Analysis: The first ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" and the second ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

4. Input: dax walm wif dax
   Output: green green green red green
   Analysis: The ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is ""green."" Hence ""walm"" translates to ""green.""

5. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   Analysis: The first ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" and the second ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
Rule: walm -> Takes the color of the preceding color word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""lug"" is associated with the color ""blue."" Every time the term ""lug"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue."" Therefore, it's reasonable to infer that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" in the context of these examples.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, the following patterns can be observed:

- Whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the output includes the color ""green"".
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".
- The presence of other words (like ""zup"") corresponds to other colors (like ""yellow"").

Thus, it seems that each word is associated with a specific color in the output. Therefore, the rule induced from the examples is as follows:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" appears to change the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here's the pattern observed:

1. ""dax walm wif dax"" changes the second occurrence of ""dax"" to ""red"" while the first instance remains ""green.""
2. ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" changes the last ""dax"" to ""red"" while the others remain their original colors (""zup"" is yellow and ""dax"" is green).
3. ""wif lug"" has ""lug"" associated with ""blue,"" and ""wif"" precedes it, which results in ""red blue.""
4. ""zup lug bluf wif"" has ""wif"" following ""bluf,"" resulting only in the color after ""bluf"" being ""red,"" the others remain their original colors.
5. ""wif"" on its own has an output of ""red.""

Considering all this, the rule for ""wif"" is that it changes the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it to red.

Rule: wif -> changes the preceding word's associated color to red.
Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the previous word.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" represents a repetition of the color that corresponds to a word immediately preceding it. Each word seems to have a color association as follows:

- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red

The word ""bluf"" does not seem to correspond to a color but rather acts as a delimiter or perhaps a signal to stop the repetition.

Following this pattern, here is how the rule applies:

- Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow (walm repeats the color of zup)
- Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green (walm repeats the color of dax)
- Input: lug walm wif lug bluf -> Output: blue blue blue red blue blue (walm repeats the color blue after lug, wif is red, and lug is blue again; bluf does not repeat)
- Input: wif zup bluf lug walm -> Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue (wif is red, zup is yellow, walm repeats the color of lug, which is blue)
- Input: wif walm lug bluf -> Output: red red red blue blue (walm repeats the color of wif, which is red, then lug is blue)


Rule: walm -> repeats the color associated with the directly preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the output is ""blue.""
dax -> green

Rule: The word **dax** is consistently translated as ""green"" across all examples provided.
From the given examples, it seems that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"". Regardless of its position in the sequence, every time ""wif"" appears, the output includes the color ""red"".

Therefore:

wif -> meaning.

Rule: wif equals the color red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: When the word ""zup"" is present, the output is ""yellow."" If other words are present before or after ""zup,"" their corresponding colors are added before or after the word ""yellow"" in the output. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" as seen in the examples. ""bluf"" does not have a provided color, but from the ""dax zup bluf"" example, by deduction, it appears that ""bluf"" would also correspond to ""yellow.""
Rule: bluf -> the color of the preceding word. 

Explanation:
1. lug bluf dax lug -> blue blue green blue (Here 'bluf' takes the color of 'lug' which is 'blue')
2. lug dax bluf -> blue green green ('bluf' takes the color of 'dax' which is 'green')
3. dax wif bluf -> green red red ('bluf' takes the color of 'wif' which is 'red')
4. zup bluf wif bluf -> yellow yellow red red ('bluf' takes the color of 'zup' which is 'yellow' first, then it takes the color of 'wif' which is 'red')
5. dax bluf -> green green ('bluf' takes the color of 'dax' which is 'green')
Rule: ""walm"" means to repeat the color of the word that precedes it.

Explanation:

In each sequence:

1. ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" corresponds to ""blue green yellow green green green red"". After ""dax"" which is ""green"", ""walm"" results in another ""green"".

2. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue blue red green"". After ""lug"" which is ""blue"", ""walm"" results in another ""blue"".

3. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red"". After ""lug"" which is ""blue"", ""walm"" results in another ""blue"".

4. ""lug zup walm lug"" corresponds to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". After ""zup"" which is ""yellow"", ""walm"" results in another ""yellow"".

5. ""lug wif walm"" corresponds to ""blue red red red"". After ""wif"" which is ""red"", ""walm"" results in another ""red"".

Thus, walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples given, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" In each case, no matter its position in the sequence, ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the output.

Thus, the rule is:
wif -> red
To understand the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to analyze the context in which it appears and the output provided.

From the first two examples:
Input: dax zup -> Output: green yellow
Input: lug zup -> Output: blue yellow

From these, we can see that different words preceding ""zup"" result in different first colors but the second color remains consistent (yellow). This suggests that ""zup"" may be responsible for the color ""yellow"" in the output.

Looking at the other examples where ""zup"" occurs at the beginning:
Input: zup lug walm -> Output: yellow blue blue blue
Input: zup bluf wif walm -> Output: yellow yellow red red red

In these, ""zup"" is followed by either one or more words, but the first color in the output is consistently ""yellow"" when ""zup"" is the first word. This supports the idea that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" when it comes first.

Observing the color pattern of the other words, it seems that each has a consistent color associated with it regardless of its position. For example, ""lug"" always results in ""blue,"" ""walm"" always results in ""red,"" and ""bluf"" seems to result in ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""zup"" means ""yellow"" when it is the first word in the input sequence. It is possible that ""zup"" could have a different meaning or rule associated with it when it appears in other positions, but there is no data provided to confirm this. With the given examples, we can only deduce that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" when it is at the beginning of the sequence.

Rule: When ""zup"" is the first word in the input, the first color in the output is ""yellow"".
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at the provided examples and their corresponding outputs.

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red

Input: lug bluf wif
Output: blue blue red

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: lug bluf dax bluf
Output: blue blue green green

Through these examples, we can observe a pattern: whenever the input contains the word ""bluf,"" the corresponding output includes the color blue. Thus, we can determine that the word ""bluf"" is associated with the color blue in each example. The remaining output colors correspond to the other words in the input (""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""dax""), but since we are asked to deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" specifically, we can ignore these for now.

Based on the provided data, the rule we can induce is:

Rule: bluf -> blue
Analyzing the given input-output pairs and focusing on the occurrences of the nonce word ""walm,"" the following observations can be made:

1. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" -> ""blue red yellow red red red""
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup wif"" and results in ""red red red.""

2. ""zup walm lug wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red""
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and results in ""yellow yellow.""

3. ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" -> ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow""
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and again results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""

4. ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red""
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and results in ""red red.""

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" translates into repeating the color that directly precedes ""walm"" two or three times. However, from the examples given, it's unclear when it should be repeated two times and when it should be repeated three times. There seems to be a potential relationship between the color before ""walm"" and the repetition frequency.

With the information provided, an exact rule cannot be deciphered, as there's not enough data to establish when the preceding color should be repeated twice or thrice. More examples would be needed to establish that pattern, especially examples where ""walm"" follows different words or the sequence where the repetition varies.

However, we can establish an incomplete rule where ""walm"" equals a repetition of the color that comes before it:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the preceding color multiple times. (Specifically, either 2 or 3 times based on an undetermined condition.)

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Regardless of the context, the word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"".
Reviewing the examples provided, it seems that the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" consistently in each case. Additionally, it appears that the color is not dependent on the context, as it always maintains the same color output despite the surrounding nonce words.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position or context within a given input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" by comparing the inputs containing ""bluf"" to their corresponding outputs.

From the first example:
Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
Output: green yellow red red blue

The ""bluf"" word corresponds to the second ""red"" in the output. We do not have enough information from this example alone to deduce its meaning.

From the second example:
Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green

""Bluf"" corresponds to the first and second ""blue"" in the output. Again, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" here, but we need more data to be certain.

From the third example:
Input: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup
Output: blue blue red blue blue yellow

Here, ""bluf"" occurs twice and corresponds to ""blue"" in the output both times.

From the fourth example:
Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

""Bluf"" corresponds to a second ""red"" in the output, which might seem contradictory given the previous patterns but note that only two words were in this input and there is no context given.

Finally, from the fifth example:
Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""yellow"" in the output.

Based on these inputs and outputs, we can see that ""bluf"" corresponds to redundant or repeated color in the output sequence that immediately follows the color that the other word represents. Therefore, ""bluf"" represents the rule of repetition.

Rule: bluf -> The color word it follows is repeated in the output.
Observing the given examples, the word ""walm"" appears to relate to the repetition of the color immediately preceding it in the sequence. Let's break down each example to illustrate this:

1. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
   - Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" which is immediately followed by two more ""yellow"" before the sequence changes to ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""blue"" for ""lug.""

2. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" which is then repeated two more times, followed by ""green"" for ""dax.""

3. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" followed by ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue."" ""Walm"" then repeats the ""blue"" twice. ""Wif"" changes the color to ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats the ""red"" twice.

4. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" which is then repeated twice by ""walm,"" followed by ""yellow"" for ""zup,"" and ""blue"" for ""lug.""

5. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" followed by ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""blue"" for ""lug."" ""Walm"" then repeats the ""blue"" twice.

Given these observations, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it to repeat twice. If 'x' is the word before ""walm"" and the output for 'x' is 'color', then ""walm"" results in 'color color color'.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax wif
    ",Output: blue green red,blue green red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the outputs.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" is consistently mapped to the color ""green"" in each example, independent of the context or the position of the word in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the rule can be deduced as follows:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, each instance of ""zup"" results in the output ""yellow."" There does not appear to be any contextual dependence on the position of ""zup"" within the sequence; it consistently translates to the same output. Therefore, it can be deduced that the word ""zup"" corresponds directly to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> red.
walm -> meaning. Meaning can be the rule that ""walm"" outputs the color of the word that follows it, except when it is at the end of a sequence, in which case the output is blue.

Rule: If ""walm"" precedes a word, the output color should be the same as the color designated for the following word. If ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence, the output color is blue.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm zup lug bluf wif
    ",Output: blue blue yellow blue blue red red,blue blue blue yellow blue blue red,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the provided examples.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" is associated with the color red. This conclusion is drawn from the consistent replacement of the word ""wif"" with the color red in the outputs. Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it can be deduced that the word ""bluf"" is translated as the color immediately preceding it. Let's validate this with each example:

1. wif lug bluf -> red blue blue (bluf follows lug, which is blue)
2. zup bluf lug dax lug -> yellow yellow blue green blue (bluf follows zup, which is yellow)
3. dax wif dax zup bluf -> green red green yellow yellow (bluf follows zup, which is yellow)
4. dax bluf -> green green (bluf follows dax, which is green)
5. lug bluf -> blue blue (bluf follows lug, which is blue)

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the word preceding it.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns present in the input and their corresponding outputs. We will analyze each example and identify what each color might represent:

1. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

2. Input: lug dax walm
   Output: blue green green green

3. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

4. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue

From the above examples, it appears that each word before ""walm"" corresponds to a color, specifically:
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

The word ""walm"" seems to cause the color that it follows to repeat a certain number of times. Looking closely at the outputs, we can try to deduce a rule:

- In examples 1 and 2, the color before ""walm"" repeats three times.
- In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), and there are two additional ""blue"" outputs before the pattern changes due to the word ""wif"".
- In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), and there are two additional ""yellow"" outputs.
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), and there are two additional ""blue"" outputs.

One possible rule is that ""walm"" causes the color of the word that precedes it to repeat two more times than it would otherwise, given that the pattern changes with a new color word.

Rule: walm -> The color word immediately preceding ""walm"" is repeated two additional times in the output. For example, if ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue"") precedes ""walm,"" the output would contain ""blue blue blue"" for the sequence ""lug walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax walm lug bluf dax wif
    ",Output: yellow green green green blue blue green red,yellow green green green blue blue green red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""lug."" To do this, let's examine the presence of ""lug"" in each input and how it correlates with the output:

1. Input: dax lug bluf dax 
   Output: green blue blue green 
   - ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

2. Input: lug zup bluf dax
   Output: blue yellow yellow green
   - The first word ""lug"" also corresponds to the color ""blue.""

3. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   - ""lug"" is placed after ""wif"" and the output is ""red,"" however, we need to consider the ""dax walm"" pattern before and ""dax walm"" pattern after which correspond to ""green green"" each, potentially indicating ""lug"" is ""blue"" as a standalone and ""red"" is an anomaly due to ""wif"".

4. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   - Again we see ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""blue blue,"" which supports the standalone ""blue"" but does not clarify if it impacts the following word.

5. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow
   - In this instance, ""lug"" precedes ""zup"" and has the output ""blue yellow,"" consistent with the ""lug"" being ""blue"" as a standalone.

Given these observations, we can rule out that ""lug"" has an impact on the following word's output color. The rule seems consistent that ""lug"" correlates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence. We can write the rule as:

Rule: lug -> blue. 

""Lug"" consistently means the color blue.
dax -> green. Rule: The word dax consistently correlates with the color green in the outputs.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's consider the consistent patterns in the given examples:

1. Regardless of position or the other words present, when ""wif"" is in the input, the color ""red"" appears in the output at least once.
2. ""wif"" when it stands alone, produces an output of ""red.""
3. ""wif"" followed by different words does not change the first color in the output, which is ""red.""
4. The other words following ""wif"" do not affect the color associated with ""wif"" itself.

Given these observations, it seems that ""wif"" consistently and independently correlates to the color ""red"" in the output. Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, irrespective of its position or the other words present in the input.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
Based on the examples provided, ""bluf"" appears to be translated to the color that corresponds to the immediately preceding word in the Input. Let's examine the instances:

- In the first example, the word before ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""red,"" which corresponds to ""wif.""
- In the second example, the word before ""bluf"" is ""lug,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue,"" which corresponds to ""lug.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow,"" matching ""zup.""
- The fourth example shows ""bluf"" following ""lug"" again, with the output being ""blue,"" consistent with ""lug.""
- Lastly, in the fifth example, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" and the output is ""green,"" aligning with ""dax.""

Based on the pattern, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes on the color value of the word before it. As a rule induction, the interpretation would be:

Rule: bluf -> the color of the word immediately before it in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns preceding and following its occurrence:

Input: `wif walm zup lug zup walm`
Output: `red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow`

Here, walm appears after the color red is repeated three times and is followed by a sequence of yellow. It then appears after blue and is followed by a sequence of yellow again. This indicates that walm might be associated with repeating the color that comes directly before it.

Input: `dax walm wif`
Output: `green green green red`

Walm follows the green color and green is repeated.

Input: `wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug`
Output: `red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue`

Again, walm follows the color blue and blue is repeated.

Input: `lug walm`
Output: `blue blue blue`

Walm follows the color blue and blue is repeated.

Input: `wif dax zup walm`
Output: `red green yellow yellow yellow`

Walm follows yellow and yellow is repeated.

Based on these observations, the rule for walm appears to be as follows:

Rule: When walm appears in the sequence, it causes the last mentioned color to be repeated varying number times.

Walm -> meaning. Repeat the last mentioned color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm wif walm dax lug dax
    ",Output: green green green red red red green blue green,green green green red red red green blue green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in all given examples.
From the examples provided, it appears that each word corresponds to a color. ""Lug"" is consistently translated to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" The word ""dax"" also appears to correspond to the color ""green,"" as every time it is used in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided information, here is the rule induction for the nonce word ""wif"":

Input: wif dax lug walm -> Output: red green blue blue blue
Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
Input: wif -> Output: red
Input: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup -> Output: blue blue red blue blue yellow
Input: wif dax zup dax -> Output: red green yellow green

Rule:
wif -> red

Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, it consistently corresponds to ""red"" in the output. This is evident regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input sequence or the other words present. Therefore, ""wif"" means ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning or the rules associated with the word ""zup"" and the other nonce words by looking at the patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Here are the patterns observed:

1. Whenever the word ""zup"" appears by itself or with other words, the output always starts with ""yellow"". This suggests that the word ""zup"" translates directly to ""yellow"". 

2. The word ""lug"" appears twice, and in both instances, it is followed by ""blue"" in the output. This indicates that ""lug"" likely means ""blue"".

3. The word ""dax"" appears once, followed by ""green"" in the output. Since it only appears once and the result is immediately after it, we could assume ""dax"" means ""green"", but this is less certain without more examples.

4. The word ""bluf"" appears three times, and each time, ""green"" follows it in the output, so we can be pretty confident that ""bluf"" means ""green"".

5. ""walm"" and ""wif"" both appear once, accompanied by ""yellow"" and ""red"" respectively in the output. They are followed by the same color, suggesting a repetition rule: when a word is followed by the same color in the output, it means that color is repeated. Since ""walm"" precedes ""yellow"" and ""wif"" precedes ""red"", we could hypothesize that ""walm"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red"".

From these patterns, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" seems to be:

Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" every time it appears. 

Therefore:
zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, the word 'bluf' seems to function as a repeater of the color associated with the word that directly precedes it. In each example, the color associated with the word that comes before 'bluf' is repeated in the output immediately after the original color's translation.

Here are the examples broken down, with 'bluf' causing the repetition of the preceding color:

- In ""zup bluf,"" 'zup' translates to 'yellow,' and 'bluf' causes it to repeat, thus ""yellow yellow.""
- In ""lug zup bluf dax,"" we have 'lug' -> 'blue,' 'zup' -> 'yellow,' and 'bluf' repeats 'yellow,' followed by 'dax,' which translates to 'green.'
- In ""lug bluf wif,"" 'lug' translates to 'blue,' 'bluf' repeats 'blue,' and 'wif' translates to 'red.'
- In ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup,"" each word translates to its color, and 'bluf' repeats the color of the word before it ('zup' -> 'yellow').
- ""wif bluf lug"" follows the same pattern, with 'wif' translating to 'red,' 'bluf' repeating 'red,' and 'lug' translating to 'blue.'

Therefore, the rule for 'bluf' is:

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color corresponding to the previous word.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" represents the rule of repeating the color associated with the word directly preceding it. Let's confirm this with the given examples:

Example 1:
Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow""
""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue""

Example 2:
Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

""wif walm"" -> ""red red""

Example 3:
Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue""

Example 4:
Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

""wif walm"" -> ""red red""

Example 5:
Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue""

Based on the consistency of these examples, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the color of the previous word to be repeated.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax lug
    ",Output: blue green blue,blue green blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in all given examples, regardless of its position in the sequence or the context provided by the other words.
Based on the examples provided, we are looking to determine the meaning of the word ""dax"" within this particular context. To do this, we will look for patterns in where ""dax"" appears and how it corresponds to the outputs given. 

Looking at the examples:

1. Input: wif dax zup wif
   Output: red green yellow red
2. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red
3. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue
4. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
   Output: blue green green red green
5. Input: wif dax zup dax
   Output: red green yellow green

We see that:

- After ""wif,"" the output is ""red,"" both times in Examples 1 and 5.
- After ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow"" in Example 1.
- After ""lug,"" the output is ""blue"" in Example 3.
- In every instance where ""dax"" is used, the output is ""green.""

Using these observations, we can deduce that ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green."" Now, let's write this as the rule as requested:

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's look at the consistent use of the word across different inputs and the resulting outputs.

- In the first example, ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red."" Since ""bluf"" is repeated, and both outputs are ""red,"" it's reasonable to assume that ""wif"" may mean ""red.""

- In the second example, ""dax bluf wif lug zup"" results in ""green green red blue yellow."" Since the word ""wif"" is followed by the output ""red,"" this supports the assumption that ""wif"" means ""red.""

- In the third example, the input ""wif"" stands alone and the output is ""red."" This further consolidates the notion that ""wif"" means ""red.""

- In the fourth example, ""lug zup wif lug"" results in ""blue yellow red blue."" The word ""lug"" appears twice and the color ""blue"" also appears twice. ""Zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" once again correlates with ""red.""

- In the fifth example, ""dax walm wif zup"" results in ""green green green red yellow."" The word ""dax"" repeats with ""green,"" ""walm"" (a new word) is also followed by ""green,"" and ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" again. ""Zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""

Across all examples, regardless of the context or position in the sequence, ""wif"" correlates with the output ""red."" Therefore, the rule we can infer is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds consistently to the color ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the examples provided, we can infer the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" by examining its corresponding output in various contexts:

Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
Output: red yellow yellow red green

Input: zup lug bluf
Output: yellow blue blue

Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow

Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
Output: yellow blue red green green red

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red

From the examples, we can establish the following:

1. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the output is ""red"" for ""wif"" followed by ""yellow.""
2. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" or ""lug,"" which output ""yellow"" and ""blue"" respectively, the output for ""bluf"" is the same color as the word before it.
3. ""bluf"" never produces a unique output color that is not found elsewhere in the sequence.

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" could be that it outputs the same color as the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> outputs the same color as the preceding word.
Observing the given examples, let us analyze each one:

- Input: zup wif dax walm -> Output: yellow red green green green
- Input: zup wif dax walm lug -> Output: yellow red green green green blue
- Input: zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red
- Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
- Input: lug walm zup -> Output: blue blue blue yellow

From the examples, we can glean the following patterns:

- The presence of the word 'zup' in the input results in the color yellow in the output. When 'zup' is the first word, we see a yellow at the start. When 'zup' is the last word, we see yellow at the end.
- The word 'wif' in the input corresponds to the color red in the output.
- 'Dax' in the input corresponds to a single green in the output.
- 'Lug' in the input corresponds to the color blue.

When the word 'walm' appears, it is showing a pattern of repeating the preceding color in the output. To summarize:

- In the first example, 'walm' follows 'dax' (which outputs green), and we see a repetition of green three times.
- In the second example, the output pattern is the same as in the first example with an additional color (blue) at the end due to the presence of 'lug' after 'walm'.
- In the third example, 'walm' follows 'wif' (which outputs red), and we see a repetition of red three times.
- In the fourth example, 'walm' directly follows 'zup' (which outputs yellow), and we see a repetition of yellow three times.
- In the fifth example, 'walm' is between 'lug' and 'zup', implying repetitions of blue and then a yellow at the end due to 'zup'.

Based on these observations, the rule for 'walm' seems to be that it repeats the color output of the word that immediately precedes it three times. If there is no preceding word, like in the example ""zup walm"", it repeats the output color of 'zup'.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color output of the preceding word three times in the output. If there is no preceding word to define the color, repeat the color associated with 'zup'.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug
    ",Output: red blue,red blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

The examples consistently show that whenever the nonce word ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" is the corresponding output. There is no indication that ""lug"" changes meaning depending on context – it translates to the color blue in a straightforward, one-to-one manner.
Based on the provided examples, it is possible to infer that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output consistently contains the word ""green."" There are no examples where ""dax"" is associated with any other color or output.

Rule:
dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red

The examples indicate that every time the word ""wif"" is used in the input, the color ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to compare each input with its respective output and identify a consistent pattern.

- In all examples where the word ""zup"" appears, the color ""yellow"" is included in the output.
- ""zup"" does not seem to replace any other colors because other words (dax, lug, wif, walm) are consistently translated to other colors (green, blue, red, yellow respectively) even when ""zup"" is present in the input.

Therefore, by examining the consistent presence of the color ""yellow"" in every output where ""zup"" is in the corresponding input, we can induce that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> duplicates the color word prior to it. Rule: If a color word is followed by the word ""bluf,"" it should be repeated.
Based on the examples given, we can infer a rule about the word ""walm"":

1. ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue.""
2. ""dax walm wif"" translates to ""green green green red.""
3. ""lug walm wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue red.""
4. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green.""
5. ""dax zup walm wif walm"" translates to ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red.""

It can be observed that the occurrence of ""walm"" results in repetition of the preceding color word three times. The word before ""walm"" is a color, and ""walm"" causes the output to repeat that color word thrice. If there is more than one ""walm"" without an intervening color word, the last mentioned color is repeated an additional three times for each ""walm."" ""wif"" seems to translate to ""red,"" but it's not the focus of the rule induction for ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previously mentioned color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided. The word ""dax"" appears in different positions within the input sequences; however, the output always has ""green"" in the position corresponding to where ""dax"" appeared in the input. This consistent pattern suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the outputs.

So, based on the examples given:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is green in the exact position.
- The position of ""dax"" in the input list does not matter; it always results in ""green.""
- The presence of other words does not affect the output attributed to ""dax,"" as it remains green regardless of the other words' outputs.

From this information, we can induce that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". Thus, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the output, irrespective of its position or the context in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following associations for each non-nonce word:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- walm -> blue
- wif -> red

When trying to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" we can look at its output in each context:

- When ""zup"" is present, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output.

The usage of ""zup"" is consistent across all examples. Every time ""zup"" appears, the color ""yellow"" is in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, it seems that ""zup"" directly translates to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it seems that 'bluf' is a modifier that affects the word that precedes it. The rule seems to be that whatever color is represented by the word before 'bluf', the output is that color repeated twice.

Let's break down the examples:

1. Input: lug bluf wif -> Output: blue blue red
   - lug represents blue and is followed by bluf, resulting in blue being repeated twice.
   - wif represents red.

2. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm -> Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   - wif represents red.
   - zup represents yellow and is followed by bluf, resulting in yellow being repeated twice.
   - lug represents blue and is followed by walm, which seems to also represent blue based on the triplet blue output.

3. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
   - wif represents red and is followed by bluf, resulting in red being repeated twice.

4. Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green
   - dax represents green and is followed by bluf, resulting in green being repeated twice.

5. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug -> Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
   - zup represents yellow, and lug represents blue.
   - The second zup is followed by bluf, resulting in yellow repeated twice.
   - The final lug stands alone representing blue.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The word 'bluf' after a color word causes that color word to be outputted twice. If 'bluf' is followed by a color word itself, it gets output as that single color. If there is no word after 'bluf', it seems that 'bluf' causes the previous color word to be repeated once more.

Hence:
bluf -> The meaning is to repeat the color represented by the preceding word twice. If 'bluf' is the last word or followed by another color, it behaves as a single repetition of the preceding color.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can use the outputs for the given inputs to find patterns.

Let's analyze the entries where ""walm"" is present:

1. Input: lug wif zup wif walm
   Output: blue red yellow red red red
   
   ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and ""red"" is repeated.

2. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   
   ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" and ""blue"" is repeated.

3. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue
   
   ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and ""green"" is repeated.

4. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   
   ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" and ""blue"" is repeated.

5. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   
   ""walm"" is at the end, and ""yellow"" is repeated.

From the above findings, we can deduce that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word that precedes it. For instance, in example 1, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated. Similarly, in the second example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated. The pattern holds for the other examples as well.

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the previous word to be repeated.

Therefore, we can define the rule:
walm -> causes the repetition of the color corresponding to the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax walm lug
    ",Output: yellow green green blue,yellow green green green blue,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in every given example.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in each instance it is used.
Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> the word immediately preceding bluf is repeated, and the color associated with that word is provided. Rule:

When ""lug"" comes before ""bluf,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" so the output is ""blue blue"" following ""lug.""

When ""bluf"" comes after a word like ""dax"" or ""zup,"" the color associated with those words (""green"" for ""dax"" and ""yellow"" for ""zup"") is repeated.

When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" since ""wif"" equals ""red,"" the output is ""red red.""

Rule: If ""bluf"" is preceded by a word, the output is the color associated with the preceding word repeated twice. If ""bluf"" follows a word and is succeeded by a different word, it repeats the color associated with the preceding word and then outputs the color associated with the following word.
The word ""walm"" seems to be associated with the repetition of the color that immediately precedes it. Therefore, when ""walm"" appears after another word, the color that corresponds to that word is repeated three times.

For instance:
- ""dax walm wif zup"" becomes ""green green green red yellow,"" with ""green"" being repeated because of ""walm"" coming after ""dax,"" which corresponds to green.
- ""wif walm"" simply becomes ""red red red"" because ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" which corresponds to red.
- ""dax walm wif walm"" leads to ""green green green red red red,"" again with the ""green"" and ""red"" colors being repeated due to ""walm.""

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the previous color three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the color corresponding to that word is repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
Based on the examples provided, the translation for the nonce word ""dax"" is consistent across all examples. Therefore, the meaning can be deduced as follows:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" is translated to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" is associated with changing the color output to red. When ""wif"" appears before or after a word, the word preceding or succeeding ""wif"" maintains its color code, but ""wif"" itself changes the color output to red.

Let's break down each example to determine the rule:

1. Example: dax wif dax
   - Output: green red green
   - Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and when ""wif"" is in the middle, it turns red.

2. Example: dax zup wif
   - Output: green yellow red
   - Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" at the end turns red.
   
3. Example: dax wif walm
   - Output: green red red red
   - Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and both ""wif"" and ""walm"" turn red.
   
4. Example: wif lug walm
   - Output: red blue blue blue
   - Rule: ""wif"" in the beginning turns red, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" also turns blue when following ""lug,"" even though it turned red when following ""wif"" in the previous example.
   
5. Example: lug wif bluf
   - Output: blue red red
   - Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" while ""wif"" remains red and seems to cause ""bluf"" to turn red too.

Based on these observations, we can induce that ""wif"" changes the output to red, and it has the potential to influence the color output of the word following it to also be red in certain contexts (unless the preceding word has a stronger association with another color, as seen in examples 1 and 2).

Rule: wif -> turns the output to red, and can influence the following word to also be red unless the preceding word maintains its color association.
Based on the examples provided, the following rules for the nonce word ""zup"" and the structure of the sentences can be deduced:

1. When ""zup"" appears by itself, the output is ""yellow.""
   Input: ""zup"" -> Output: ""yellow""

2. When ""zup"" is combined with ""wif,"" the output is ""yellow"" followed by the color associated with ""wif,"" which is ""red.""
   Input: ""wif zup"" -> Output: ""red yellow""

3. When ""zup"" is combined with ""dax,"" placing ""zup"" before ""dax"" outputs the colors in the order ""yellow"" then ""green,"" the color associated with ""dax.""
   Input: ""zup dax"" -> Output: ""yellow green""

4. When ""zup"" follows ""wif"" and ""dax,"" the colors corresponding to each individual word appear in the order the words are presented.
   Input: ""zup wif dax"" -> Output: ""yellow red green""
   Input: ""dax wif zup"" -> Output: ""green red yellow""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""zup"" seems to be:

Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" and the order of colors in the output follows the order of words in the input, each mapping to their respective color— ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" serves as a duplicator or repeater for the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Each unique word seems to correspond to a specific color: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" When ""bluf"" follows any of these words, the output is simply the color associated with the preceding word repeated twice.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color associated with the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the correlation between the inputs and outputs given the examples provided:

Input: zup wif dax walm
Output: yellow red green green green

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red

Input: dax walm zup lug dax
Output: green green green yellow blue green

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

From the examples, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" The word ""lug"" appears once and corresponds to ""blue.""

Now let's focus on the occurrences of ""walm"" to see if we can identify a pattern:

1. ""walm"" occurring at the end of the sentence results in a repetition of ""green"" that follows the appearance of ""dax."" (Example 1 and Example 5)
2. ""walm"" occurring after ""wif"" but before ""dax"" results in a repetition of ""red"" following its occurrence. (Example 3)
3. ""walm"" alone following ""dax"" adds an additional ""green"" to the sequence. (Example 4)

Upon further observation, in all cases where ""walm"" is present, it seems to cause a repetition of the color word that precedes it in the output. Therefore, the most likely meaning of ""walm"" is that it signifies a repetition of the previous color in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color word that comes before it in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug wif
    ",Output: green blue red,green blue red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words around it.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the meaning of ""dax"" appears to be as follows:

Rule: dax -> green

In each example, the presence of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the words that precede or follow it. Therefore, ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green.""
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following correspondence between the nonce word ""wif"" and the output colors.

- Whenever the word ""wif"" is present, the color ""red"" is output.
- The presence of ""wif"" does not depend on its position; no matter where it is placed in the sequence, it always corresponds to ""red.""
- Other words like ""dax,"" ""bluf,"" ""zup,"" and ""walm"" have translated to other colors (green, blue, and yellow), but ""wif"" is consistent in its output.

Therefore, we can conclude that the nonce word ""wif"" systematically corresponds to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following associations between the nonce words and colors:

- ""dax"" is consistently associated with the color green.
- ""walm"" is associated with the color green and seems to yield as many green outputs as the number of times it appears.
- ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.
- ""zup"" is consistently associated with the color yellow, regardless of its position or what other words are present.

Therefore, we can deduce the rule for the meaning of ""zup"":

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding outputs, focusing on the position and repetition of ""bluf"" and other words:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" is the third word, and the output is ""yellow.""
   Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" is the second word and still corresponds to ""red.""
   Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green
   
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" is the second word, and the output is ""blue.""
   Input: lug bluf zup lug
   Output: blue blue yellow blue

4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" appears second and also results in ""red.""
   Input: wif bluf lug dax wif
   Output: red red blue green red

5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is the second word, with the output being ""yellow.""
   Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
   Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow

Looking at the patterns, we can see that the output color for ""bluf"" is consistent with the output color of the word that comes just before it. Thus, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word in the list.

Rule: bluf -> Takes on the color of the preceding word.
Based on the provided examples, each nonce word seems to correspond to a color, and the repetition in the outputs suggests that the rule is focused on repetition of the color that each nonce word represents. Here's the breakdown of the patterns:

- ""wif walm"" gives ""red red red,"" so ""wif"" likely means ""red"" and ""walm"" represents a rule to repeat that color thrice.
- ""zup wif walm"" gives ""yellow red red red""; ""zup"" therefore likely means ""yellow,"" ""wif"" again means ""red,"" and ""walm"" dictates repeating the color that comes before it thrice.
- ""zup walm"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which reinforces the rule that ""walm"" repeats the color that precedes it, in this case, ""yellow"" from ""zup"" thrice.
- ""wif lug walm"" gives ""red blue blue blue""; ""wif"" meaning ""red"" again, ""lug"" likely means ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats the color before it thrice.
- ""dax walm"" gives ""green green green,"" suggesting ""dax"" means ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats the preceding color thrice.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color signified by the preceding nonce word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm dax
    ",Output: blue blue blue green,blue blue blue green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the context.
Dax -> green. Rule: The word dax consistently translates to the color green regardless of its position within the sequence.
wif -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" appears to correspond to the color ""red."" 

Rule: wif translates to ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Each occurrence of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the context or position within the sequence. There is a one-to-one mapping between the word ""zup"" and the color ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns of the colors associated with the words in each input/output pair.

Input: dax bluf wif
Output: green green red

The word ""dax"" comes before ""bluf"" and both are translated to green. This suggests that ""bluf"" follows the color of the preceding word, which in this case is green.

Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow

Here ""zup"" translates to yellow and ""dax"" translates to green. After ""zup,"" ""bluf"" is yellow, and after ""lug"" (which translates to blue), ""bluf"" is also blue. After ""dax,"" ""bluf"" translates to green. This continues to support the idea that ""bluf"" matches the color of the preceding word.

Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow

The word ""wif"" translates to red and is followed by ""bluf,"" which is also red. ""Lug"" is blue and ""zup"" is yellow. There is no inconsistency here.

Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
Output: green blue yellow red red green

The sequence ends with ""wif bluf dax,"" where ""wif"" is red and so is ""bluf,"" while ""dax"" returns to green.

Input: lug dax bluf
Output: blue green green

""Bluf"" follows ""dax"" and both are green. 

Based on the examples given, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes on the color of the word that precedes it in the list.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.
Based on the given examples, it seems the nonce word ""walm"" is associated with repeating the color name of the immediately preceding color in the output. To corroborate this, let's analyze each example.

Input: dax lug dax lug walm
Output: green blue green blue blue blue
Rule application: 'dax' outputs 'green'; 'lug' outputs 'blue'. After 'walm', 'blue' is repeated twice.

Input: dax zup dax walm
Output: green yellow green green green
Rule application: 'dax' outputs 'green'; 'zup' outputs 'yellow'. After 'walm', 'green' is repeated three times.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
Rule application: 'dax' outputs 'green'. After 'walm', 'green' is repeated twice.

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red
Rule application: 'dax' outputs 'green'; 'wif' outputs 'red'. After 'walm', 'red' is repeated three times.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
Rule application: 'dax' outputs 'green'. After 'walm', 'green' is repeated twice.

From the examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the previous color name to repeat a number of times, which is at least two. However, it's not clear whether ""walm"" dictates the number of repetitions exactly, as it varies across the examples given. Nevertheless, a consistent observation is that ""walm"" results in repetition of the prior color.

Rule: walm -> causes the previous color in the sequence to repeat multiple times. The exact number of repetitions is not consistent in the provided data.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule:

lug -> blue

Every time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, it appears that each word in the input corresponds to a particular color in the output. The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, we can infer that the word 'wif' directly corresponds to the color 'red.' Each time 'wif' appears in an input, 'red' appears in the corresponding output, regardless of the position of 'wif' within the input sequence.

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red
zup -> meaning. The word ""zup"" appears to correspond to the color yellow regardless of the context it is presented in. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: zup means yellow.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we can inspect shared patterns across the examples provided. The word ""bluf"" appears in each input and there is a color in the output that corresponds to this word each time. Here are the observations:

1. ""bluf"" is present in every input, and ""red"" is present in every output, with the number of ""bluf""s matching the number of ""red""s:
   - Input: wif bluf / Output: red red (One ""bluf"" corresponds to one ""red"")
   - Input: wif bluf lug dax wif / Output: red red blue green red (One ""bluf"" corresponds to one ""red"")

2. ""bluf"" is also present when other words are present, and the output lists their respective colors:
   - Input: dax bluf lug wif / Output: green green blue red
   - Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug / Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

Given these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" and it does not seem to change based on context or other words present in the input.

Rule: bluf -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze each example and observe patterns tied to it.

In each instance, the output consists of a series of colors that repeat. Notice that more important is the word immediately before ""walm,"" as it correlates with the color that repeats:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red.""
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green.""

Since the colors repeat, the rule might involve repetition, derived particularly from the word that ""walm"" succeeds. Also, ""walm"" does not seem to have a color associated with it directly but instead indicates that the following pattern should consist of multiples of the color tied to the preceding word. It might function as a command for repetition of the next color in the sequence presented in the output.

Observing that in the combined examples, ""walm"" causes the color associated with the last distinct word to repeat, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" multiple times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm
    ",Output: green green green,green green green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue.""
Rule: dax -> green

This rule is deduced as follows:

- In every example, wherever the word ""dax"" appears, the word ""green"" follows in the output.
- It is consistent regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input.
- Other words in the input lead to other colors in the output, but ""dax"" consistently leads to ""green.""
Based on the provided examples:

Input: zup wif zup -> Output: yellow red yellow
Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
Input: zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red
Input: dax wif -> Output: green red
Input: lug wif -> Output: blue red

It appears that wif is associated with the color red, no matter what word precedes it.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:
wif -> red

Rule: When the word ""wif"" is present in an input, the corresponding output includes the color red immediately after the color associated with the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, there is a pattern that suggests a rule for what ""zup"" could mean.

Looking at the examples:
- When ""zup"" appears before ""walm"" or ""dax,"" the output for both ""zup"" and the following word is ""yellow.""
- When ""zup"" appears before ""lug,"" the output for ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and the output for ""lug"" is ""blue.""
- When ""zup"" appears before ""bluf,"" both ""zup"" and ""bluf"" output ""yellow.""

From these observations, we can discern that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in the output. There does not seem to be any additional context influencing the output related to ""zup,"" as it always results in ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the words that follow it. Therefore, the rule is as follows:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Let's look at the examples:

1. Input: ""dax wif bluf"" -> Output: ""green red red""
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". ""Bluf"" repeats the color that comes right before it, which is ""red"".

2. Input: ""wif walm lug bluf"" -> Output: ""red red red blue blue""
   Here, ""walm"" seems to also correspond to ""red"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". ""Bluf"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it, which is ""blue"".

3. Input: ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" -> Output: ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue""
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"". ""Bluf"" again repeats the color of the word it follows, which is ""yellow"".

4. Input: ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" -> Output: ""red blue blue red yellow""
   As before, ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""lug"" is ""blue"". ""Bluf"" repeats the ""blue"" from ""lug"".

5. Input: ""dax bluf"" -> Output: ""green green""
   ""Dax"" is ""green"", so ""bluf"" repeats the color ""green"".

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns of inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Let's compare:

1. Input: wif dax zup walm 
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

2. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green

In these instances, the output color changes to yellow when 'walm' appears after 'zup', and 'dax' gives the output green. When 'zup' and 'dax' appear without 'walm', the output colors are different ('zup' results in yellow and 'dax' in green). This indicates that the presence of 'walm' changes the color output associated with other words before it to yellow until a new word appears that changes the color sequence again.

3. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red

Here, 'walm' follows 'lug', resulting in a repetition of blue output. 'wif' results in red output afterwards.

4. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

Here, 'walm' follows 'dax', after 'bluf' and 'wif' have been given the output of red. When 'walm' is introduced, the output changes to green for 'dax' and continues to be green for 'walm'.

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

In this case, 'walm' follows 'lug', and the output remains blue for both.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that 'walm' causes the output to repeat the color of the last word that appeared before it until a new word appears that changes the color sequence. If 'walm' follows 'dax', the color changes to green, and if it follows 'lug', the color is blue. When following 'zup', it changes to yellow.

So, 'walm' seems to function as a word that extends the color output sequence of the previous word up until the point that a new word appears, which then sets a new color sequence:

Rule: walm -> continues the color sequence of the previous word until a new color is set by another word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
dax -> green

Rule: Each instance of the word ""dax"" results in the color ""green"" in the output. Regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input, it consistently corresponds to ""green"" in the output. Other words such as ""walm,"" ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""zup"" correspond to different colors (which are not consistently given in the examples), but ""dax"" is always associated with the color ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" No matter where it appears in the sequence, the output is always ""red."" 

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

wif -> meaning: ""red""

Rule: Whenever the input includes ""wif,"" the output will include ""red.""
Based on the provided input-output pairs, 'zup' consistently maps to the output 'yellow' regardless of its position or the words around it. This implies that 'zup' has an independent meaning and is not context-dependent within the given dataset. Therefore, the meaning of 'zup' can be deduced as follows:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' translates to the color 'yellow'.
Based on the provided examples, the following pattern can be established for the nonce word bluf:

1. wif dax bluf -> red green green
2. dax bluf -> green green

From the first example, it appears that ""wif dax"" corresponds to ""red green,"" and the addition of ""bluf"" afterwards results in ""red green green."" From the second example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and the addition of ""bluf"" results in ""green green.""

3. lug zup bluf dax -> blue yellow yellow green
4. dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow

From the third and fourth examples, ""bluf"" seems to add the color ""yellow"" to the sequence in one instance and repeat ""green"" in others. However, comparing both examples where ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" (examples 1 and 4), the output always includes a ""yellow"" immediately following the position of ""bluf"". In contrasts, whenever ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (examples 1, 2, and 4), the output includes a repeated color of the word immediately before ""bluf” which in these cases is ""green"".

Considering all cases, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word immediately before it. However, since ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" in the third example, leading to ""yellow green"" rather than ""yellow yellow,"" the rule might need adjustment to cover this exception.

One potential way to explain the exception is to consider the possibility that the position of ""bluf"" in a sequence might also affect its output (e.g., when ""bluf"" is in the third position, the second color is not repeated). However, we lack sufficient examples to confirm such a rule.

Therefore, based on the consistent repetition of the previous color in its provided position, a tentative rule for ""bluf"" could be stated as:

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately before it in the sequence.
walm -> repeated color that corresponds to a prior single color word

Rule: When the word ""walm"" is used after another nonce word, it triggers the repetition of the color that corresponds to the prior single nonce word. The number of repetitions corresponds to the number of times ""walm"" occurs consecutively.

For example:

- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" which indicates that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue and ""walm"" dictates that the color blue should be repeated three times.

- ""zup wif walm"" results in ""yellow red red red,"" showing that ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" triggers the repetition of red three times.

- ""dax walm zup"" corresponds to ""green green green yellow,"" indicating ""dax"" means green, ""walm"" causes green to be repeated three times, and ""zup"" adds a yellow at the end.

- ""dax walm wif walm zup"" results in ""green green green red red red yellow,"" which uses the repetition rule twice for both ""dax"" (green) and ""wif"" (red), followed by ""zup"" for yellow.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""lug"" seems straightforward.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, each input corresponds to a specific color. The word 'dax' consistently corresponds to the color green in the output. This is supported by examples 2, 3, and 4 where the only input is 'dax' and the output is consistently 'green'. Additionally, in example 1, 'dax' appears among other words and the corresponding output for 'dax' is 'green'. The last example also includes 'dax' among other words and provides 'green' as its output. Therefore, the rule can be determined as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The term ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
To determine the rules that govern the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" we need to review the examples given and identify patterns regarding its use:

1. Input: dax zup
   Output: green yellow

2. Input: zup
   Output: yellow

3. Input: wif zup bluf
   Output: red yellow yellow

4. Input: wif lug zup bluf
   Output: red blue yellow yellow

5. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow

Analyzing these examples, we can identify that the output always contains the color ""yellow"" when the word ""zup"" is in the input. Regardless of the other words present, ""yellow"" is always a part of the output corresponding to ""zup.""

Further examination does not reveal any additional complexity or context-sensitivity in the use of the word ""zup."" It does not seem to modify the meaning of the words around it (like ""dax"" or ""wif"") but stands alone as corresponding directly to ""yellow.""

Based on this evidence, we can induce the following rule for the nonce word ""zup"":

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" directly translates into the color that precedes its occurrence repeated twice. Here's the breakdown for clarification:

- When ""wif"" (red) comes before ""bluf"", the output is ""red red"".
- When ""dax"" (green) comes before ""bluf"", the output is ""green green"".
- When ""zup"" (yellow) comes before ""bluf"", the output is ""yellow yellow"".

Even when there are multiple instances of ""bluf"" or other words in between, the rule remains consistent. The word that comes before ""bluf"" has its corresponding color repeated twice in the output, irrespective of the surrounding words.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the preceding word twice.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns associated with the input and output.

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   
   - The word ""dax"" is associated with the color green repeated three times.

2. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   
   - The word ""lug"" is associated with blue repeated three times, followed by ""dax,"" which leads to a single green.
   
3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

   - The word ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow repeated three times.

4. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   
   - ""dax"" leads to green, whereas ""wif"" seems to change the pattern resulting in red repeated three times.

5. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow
   
   - Starting with ""dax,"" we see a pattern of green repeated three times. ""wif"" seems to introduce red, and ""zup"" ends with a single yellow.

From these examples, we deduce the following:

- ""dax,"" ""lug,"" and ""zup"" each correspond to a specific color, and when used alone with ""walm,"" the color is repeated three times.
- The presence of ""wif"" following ""walm"" changes the repetition of the color that should follow ""walm.""
- The second usage of ""wif"" appears to reset the repetition, allowing the next word's color to appear once.

Given that ""walm"" is the consistent element across all examples whose meaning we are trying to deduce, and taking into account the context of the provided examples, we could infer that ""walm"" signals the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word three times unless immediately followed by ""wif,"" which modifies the output to either reduce the repetition or change the color sequence.

Rule: walm -> When immediately preceded by a color-associated word, it repeats the color associated with that word three times. If followed by ""wif,"" it modifies the color sequence or repetition count.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax wif bluf
    ",Output: blue green red red,blue green red red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue,"" regardless of the context in which it appears. It does not seem to be dependent on its position in the input sequence or the words that appear around it.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""dax."" Here are the examples re-ordered for clarity:

1. wif dax bluf -> red green green
2. dax zup -> green yellow
3. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
4. dax lug bluf wif -> green blue blue red
5. dax zup -> green yellow

In each case, the output color that corresponds with ""dax"" is green, regardless of the words that follow it. The word ""dax"" is always followed by a color word, but ""dax"" specifically correlates with ""green"" each time. This is the consistent pattern despite the variability of other words and their corresponding colors. Therefore, the rule we can induce is:

Rule: dax -> green. 

Whenever ""dax"" appears in an input, the color green is produced in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the consistent element across each example:

- When ""lug wif dax"" is input, the output is ""blue red green."" Here ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" 
- When ""zup wif"" is input, the output is ""yellow red."" Here ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" 
- When ""wif zup"" is input, the output is ""red yellow."" The words' order is switched, but ""zup"" still means ""yellow."" 
- When ""wif bluf"" is input, the output is ""red red."" Here ""bluf"" seems to correspond to ""red.""
- When ""wif zup dax"" is input, the output is ""red yellow green."" ""Zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

In all cases, the presence of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" appearing in the output. It seems that ""wif"" translates directly to ""red,"" and the sequence of words in the input affects the sequence of colors in the output, with the translation being consistent for other words.

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position within the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that is repeated in the output. Each of the other nonce words seems to correspond to a specific color:

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

For each input, the word ""bluf"" is followed by the color that it translates to in the output, as evidenced by the input and output pairs:

- In the first and fifth examples, ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green,"" meaning ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" since ""wif"" also translates to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" results in ""green green red yellow blue,"" where ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""
- In the third example, ""lug zup bluf dax"" results in ""blue yellow yellow green,"" where ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" where ""bluf"" again corresponds to ""yellow.""

In each case, ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that follows it, suggesting that the rule for ""bluf"" is that it duplicates the color associated with the subsequent nonce word.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the following word.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's first look at each instance where it appears and the corresponding output:

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

2. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow

3. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

4. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red

5. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue

Now, let's analyze the outputs according to the position of ""walm"" in the inputs:

1. ""walm"" appears after lug, and the output shows one ""blue"" for ""lug"" followed by blue repeated twice more.
2. ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the color ""green"" is repeated three times before the sequence continues normally.
3. ""walm"" also follows the repetition of ""red"" three times, matching the number of words before it (including ""walm"").
4. ""walm"" follows two ""green""s and the output sequence includes another green before returning to the normal pattern.
5. After ""walm"" is a repetition of blue matching the number of words before ""walm.""

From this analysis, we can deduce that ""walm"" instructs to repeat the color output of the word that directly precedes it, and the number of repetitions matches the count of words that have appeared before ""walm"" in the input sequence, including ""walm"" itself.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the word before ""walm"" as many times as the total number of words that have appeared in the sequence up to and including ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" There is no variation in this association across all instances where ""lug"" appears.

Rule: lug -> blue.
Analyzing the examples provided, the word ""dax"" seems to correspond to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Each instance is followed by the output of ""green"" in the same position. 

To confirm:

Input: wif dax zup bluf | Output: red green yellow yellow
- ""dax"" aligns with ""green"".

Input: zup bluf dax lug | Output: yellow yellow green blue
- ""dax"" aligns with ""green"".

Input: wif lug dax walm | Output: red blue green green green
- ""dax"" aligns with ""green"".

Input: zup wif dax wif bluf | Output: yellow red green red red
- ""dax"" aligns with ""green"".

Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf | Output: blue red red green blue blue
- ""dax"" aligns with ""green"".

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's look at each example to try to identify a pattern.

- In the first example, ""Input: wif"" corresponds to ""Output: red,"" which suggests that ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
- In the next example, ""zup wif bluf"" gives us ""yellow red red."" Comparing with the previous examples, it is consistent that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" because it does so in the presence of other words that produce their respective color outputs as well (assuming ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"").
- Again, in the third example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" which confirms the same pattern.
- In ""lug wif lug,"" we get ""blue red blue."" Here once again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- Finally, in ""dax wif zup,"" which translates to ""green red yellow,"" ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following:

Rule: wif -> red. The word ""wif"" means ""red.""
Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" when it follows ""wif,"" and to ""blue"" when it follows ""lug."" In other contexts, it translates to ""yellow."" Therefore, ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately preceding it if that word is ""wif"" or ""lug,"" otherwise, it defaults to ""yellow.""

bluf -> meaning:
- Following ""wif"" -> red
- Following ""lug"" -> blue
- In any other context -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to result in the output of a sequence of a color word repeated three times. The specific color word seems to depend on the word that comes right before ""walm"". So, here are the observations:

- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""blue blue blue"".
- When ""lug wif walm"" occurs, the output is ""red red red blue"", where ""lug wif"" seems to contribute ""red red"" and ""walm"" adds ""blue"", but here ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"", so the blue is from ""lug"" not ""walm"".

Without more contrasting examples to parse the exact function of ""wif"", it is a bit more ambiguous. It seems to be a modifier that does not have a fixed color output but rather affects the subsequent color word in some way.

Considering the ""walm"" related patterns, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the preceding color name to be output three times in a row.

However, there is insufficient data to fully understand how ""wif"" interacts with ""lug"" and ""walm"". Nonetheless, the primary function of ""walm"" seems to output the previous word's associated color in triplicate, provided that the previous word is a color indicator.

walm -> The rule associated with the word ""walm"" is that it repeats the color word that immediately precedes it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Lug -> meaning. The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in each provided example.

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in an input, the word ""blue"" should appear in the output.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output includes the word ""green."" However, for a comprehensive rule, we'd need to analyze how the word ""dax"" interacts with other words, such as ""lug"" and ""wif,"" which also correspond to specific colors in the output.

Taking a closer look at the examples:

- When ""dax"" is alone, the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax lug"" is repeated, the pattern ""green blue"" is also repeated, indicating ""lug"" might mean ""blue.""
- In the last example, ""dax"" appears after the sequence ""wif... wif,"" and the output for those is ""red... green,"" implying that ""dax"" remains ""green"" regardless of its position.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that irrespective of its context, ""dax"" means ""green.""

Rule: ""dax"" -> ""green""
wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow. Each time ""zup"" is mentioned in an input, the output includes the color yellow at the same position.

Thus, the rule seems to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"". Each time ""bluf"" is used in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output.

Rule: bluf -> blue.
To deduce the rule for what ""walm"" means, we need to analyze the correlation between the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Let's examine each input and its output:

1. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow
   - Here, ""wif"" is associated with red, ""walm"" with red, and ""zup"" with yellow.

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - Here, ""lug"" is associated with blue, and ""walm"" with blue.

3. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   - Here, ""zup"" is associated with yellow, ""lug"" with blue, and ""walm"" with blue.

4. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   - Here, ""lug"" is associated with blue, ""wif"" with red, and ""walm"" with red.

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - Here, ""dax"" is associated with green, and ""walm"" with green.

Looking at the patterns, it seems that the word ""walm"" takes on the color associated with the word that precedes it. Whenever ""walm"" is present, it is followed by a repetition of the color linked to the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> repetition of the color associated with the preceding word

In the context of these examples, ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat the number of times the color associated with the preceding word appears. For example, in the case of ""lug walm"", ""lug"" is blue, so ""walm"" results in three blue repetitions since ""lug"" appears once before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs provided for each example.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Let's write this as a rule:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Analyzing the examples provided:

1. Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
   Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow

2. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow

3. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue red green green red

4. Input: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup
   Output: blue blue red blue blue yellow

5. Input: dax bluf wif
   Output: green green red

Based on the outputs, whenever the word ""bluf"" appears, the corresponding color in the output is always the same as the color before it. This pattern holds true in all five examples:

- In example 1, the word before ""bluf"" is ""zup"", which outputs as ""yellow"", so ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""yellow"".
- In example 2, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" again and the output is ""yellow"".
- In example 3, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", which corresponds to ""green"", so ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green"".
- In example 4, ""bluf"" appears twice, following ""lug"" both times, which corresponds to ""blue"", making both instances of ""bluf"" output ""blue"".
- In example 5, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green"".

Rule:
bluf -> the same color as the previous word.
To determine the meaning of ""walm"" in the given examples, we need to look at the relationship between the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Let's consider each input/output pair:

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

2. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green""

3. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup"" maintain their corresponding colors

4. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - ""lug"" and ""zup"" maintain their corresponding colors

5. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
   - ""zup,"" ""dax,"" and ""wif"" maintain their corresponding colors

By analyzing these pairs, the following pattern becomes evident:

Wherever ""walm"" appears in the input, there's an occurrence of the color ""yellow"" in the output at the same position. However, ""walm"" alone in the series doesn't map directly to ""yellow,"" because when ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green,"" and ""green"" corresponds to ""dax"" instead. The presence of ""walm,"" by itself, does not dictate the color, as its output depends on the word preceding it.

Upon closer examination, it seems that ""walm"" replicates the color of the word that directly follows it. When ""walm"" is the last word or when no word follows it, the output color is ""yellow.""

Let's verify this:

- In the first example, there is no word after ""walm,"" so the output is ""green"" due to ""dax,"" and the expected ""yellow"" for ""walm"" being at the end is not shown—this could be due to ""walm"" imitating ""dax"" here as there's no follow-up word.

- In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" Hence, the output for ""walm"" is ""yellow"" followed by ""green"" for ""dax.""

- In the third example, there is no word following ""walm,"" so the output is ""yellow,"" which aligns with the end-of-sequence behavior we've deduced.

- The fourth and fifth examples also align with the rule that ""walm"" results in an output color that replicates the color of the word directly succeeding it, with a default of ""yellow"" if it's at the end.

Rule:
walm -> When ""walm"" is followed by another word, it replicates the color output of the word directly after it. When ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, the output is ""yellow.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> meaning. Rule: ""dax"" means ""repeat the color associated with the following word"". For each occurrence of dax, the color corresponding to the next word is repeated once. For example, if ""wif"" is associated with ""red"", then ""dax wif"" would output ""green red"", where ""green"" is the new color associated with ""dax"" and ""red"" is repeated because it follows ""dax"".
Based on the examples given, the nonce word ""wif"" does not consistently correspond to a single color output. Instead, it seems to affect the sequence of color outputs that appear after it. In every given example, the occurrence of ""wif"" is followed by a sequence of colors with ""red"" being the first color immediately after ""wif.""

Analyzing the presented examples:

1. Input: zup wif walm lug → Output: yellow red red red blue
2. Input: zup wif → Output: yellow red
3. Input: lug wif walm → Output: blue red red red
4. Input: lug zup wif → Output: blue yellow red
5. Input: dax zup lug wif lug → Output: green yellow blue red blue

We notice the following pattern in association with ""wif"":

- ""wif"" itself translates to 'red' in the output.
- The words that follow ""wif"" are translated into 'red' until a word breaks the sequence that isn't ""wif"" or a word that follows ""wif"". For example, in example 1, ""walm lug"" after ""wif"" both translate to 'red', but in example 5, ""lug"" after ""wif"" translates to 'blue', which is the usual translation for ""lug"" as seen in other examples not involving ""wif"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""wif"" means 'red' and also causes subsequent words to be translated into 'red' until a word is encountered that does not follow this pattern, at which point the normal translation resumes.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the given context.
Based on the given examples, we can speculate the meaning or the rule behind the word ""bluf"" through correlating the input with the output. 

Input: zup wif bluf zup
Output: yellow red red yellow
- Here, ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" The repetition of ""zup"" in the input leads to the repetition of ""yellow"" in the output at the same positions, which helps identify their counterparts. The word ""bluf"" correlates to ""red"" as it appears between ""wif"" and ""zup,"" which are translated to ""red"" and ""yellow"" respectively.

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
- In this input, ""dax"" correlates to ""green."" The fact that ""bluf"" again results in ""green"" suggests that ""bluf"" could mean the color that is immediately preceding it.

Input: dax bluf wif
Output: green green red
- Following the established correlation for ""dax"" and ""wif,"" and keeping the insight from the previous example about ""bluf,"" it still seems that ""bluf"" could mean to repeat the color that immediately precedes it, green in this case.

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
- Applying the repeat rule for ""bluf,"" we see that ""bluf"" indeed leads to the repetition of ""yellow,"" the color that precedes it. Note that ""walm"" isn't given in the input key, but shows up as ""red"" in the output, which matches ""wif.""

Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
- Here, ""lug"" is introduced and correlates to ""blue."" The positioning of ""bluf"" after ""zup"" and the resulting ""yellow"" in the output reinforces the repeat rule.

Rule:
bluf -> Repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes ""bluf"".
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the repeated pattern in each input-output pair.

Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" is repeated three times in the output.

- Input: ""wif walm"" => Output: ""red red red""
- Input: ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" => Output: ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
    - The series ""red red red"" appears at the beginning and ""yellow yellow yellow"" follows ""zup walm."" Since we know ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" it's safe to assume that ""walm"" is causing the ""red red red.""
- Input: ""lug walm"" => Output: ""blue blue blue""
    - It seems like ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" but ""walm"" follows and instead of turning the output red, it continues the pattern of blue. This might imply ""walm"" repeats the color stated before it thrice.
- Input: ""zup bluf wif walm"" => Output: ""yellow yellow red red red""
    - ""bluf"" does not appear in any other examples, but since ""zup"" is followed by two ""yellows,"" and ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" which leads to three ""reds,"" this supports the idea that ""walm"" takes the previous color and repeats it.
- Input: ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" => Output: ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow""
    - The sequence indicates that each word corresponds to a new color until ""walm,"" which repeats the color of the word ""zup"" (yellow) three times.

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output color of the word immediately preceding ""walm"" to be repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule is:

walm -> Repeats the color stated before it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup wif
    ",Output: yellow red,yellow red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The placeholder word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""
Based on the provided input-output pairs, it seems that each unique word corresponds to a unique color. The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words around it. Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" represents the color ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow."" Whenever ""zup"" is mentioned, the word ""yellow"" is included in the output. Also, the number of times the associated color is repeated in the output corresponds to the number of syllables in each nonce word. Applying this rule:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" (one syllable, the word ""green"" is mentioned once).
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" (one syllable, the word ""red"" is mentioned once).
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" (one syllable, the word ""red"" is mentioned once, assuming ""bluf"" and ""wif"" output the same color).
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" (one syllable, the word ""red"" appears three times, which would imply a breaking of the syllable rule, but it seems more likely that ""walm"" has three syllables rather than changing the established rule).

Considering these examples, the rule may be as follows: When a noun is combined with ""zup,"" it translates to the color ""yellow"" followed by the color associated with the corresponding noun, with nouns being repeated according to the number of syllables they possess.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow"".
Rule: bluf -> red
Based on the given examples, ""walm"" appears to always generate the output ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. In each instance, it follows that ""walm"" corresponds to the word ""green,"" and does not seem to be influenced by adjacent words. Hence, the rule can be expressed as:

Rule: walm -> green

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue.""
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we will analyze the input and output pairs.

Input: dax wif lug dax
Output: green red blue green
- Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" at both the beginning and the end.

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
- In this case, ""dax"" and ""bluf"" both correspond to ""green.""

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""walm"" seems to be adding ""yellow,"" which isn't immediately relevant to solving ""dax.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf,"" as we learned, corresponds to ""green.""

Input: dax zup
Output: green yellow
- ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

Input: zup dax
Output: yellow green
- ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" is ""green.""

Given the above analyses, the examples show that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, each nonce word appears to translate to a specific color. Here's the association we can infer from the input and output pairs:

- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""bluf"" appears to produce ""red red"", which is consistent with the output ""wif"", but doubled; ""bluf"" may have a rule that relates to red but is not the word ""wif""

Given this information, the rule for the word ""wif"" appears to be:

Rule: wif translates to the color red.
Based on the provided examples, we can infer that each word translates to a specific color. The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the same color across different examples. Here are the translations based on the given input and output pairs:

- ""wif"" translates to ""red"" since ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" translates to ""red blue blue red yellow,"" and ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red.""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" since ""lug zup lug"" translates to ""blue yellow blue,"" and ""zup lug"" translates to ""yellow blue.""
- ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" since ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" translates to ""red blue blue red yellow.""

""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" in every instance it appears:

- ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" -> ""red blue blue red yellow""
- ""lug zup lug"" -> ""blue yellow blue""
- ""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red"" (twice)
- ""zup lug"" -> ""yellow blue""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the word ""green,"" but only when following the word ""dax."" When following the words ""wif"" or ""lug,"" it translates to ""red"" and ""blue,"" respectively. When ""bluf"" precedes the sequence, the translation depends on the preceding words; ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

To summarize, ""bluf"" acts as a repeater, duplicating the color associated with the word that directly precedes it.
 
bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at how it is used in relation to the other words and the respective outputs.

Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
- Here, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
- Again, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"".

Input: lug walm zup walm
Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
- ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue"" and ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"".

Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" ""zup walm"" at the end results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" confirming the previous instance of ""zup walm"".

Input: zup dax lug walm zup
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug walm"" again to ""blue blue blue"".

Based on these examples, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word that precedes it three times. Thus, when ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue"") is followed by ""walm,"" it leads to ""blue blue blue."" When ""zup"" (which corresponds to ""yellow"") is followed by ""walm,"" it results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Rule:
walm -> repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. It does not appear to change meaning due to context or adjacent words. Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""lug"" is straightforward:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Every time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's examine the given examples:

1. Input: wif
   Output: red

2. Input: lug wif lug
   Output: blue red blue

3. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

4. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

5. Input: wif
   Output: red

From these examples, ""wif"" consistently results in ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. There is no variability in the associated color, so ""wif"" directly corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> ""red""
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of the context in which it is used. Each time ""zup"" is present in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output at the same position. 

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf replicates the color of the word preceding it. If the word bluf is the first word, then there is no color to replicate; however, the examples show that it has never been used at the beginning, so the rule assumes bluf follows a word it can copy the color from.

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows the word ""dax,"" which corresponds to the color ""green,"" so bluf takes on the meaning of ""green.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, hence ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" first follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, making ""bluf"" also ""blue."" Then it follows ""lug"" again and then ""zup,"" taking on the color of each accordingly (blue, then yellow).
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" taking on the color ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color ""red,"" making ""bluf"" ""red.""

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word.
Analyzing the examples provided, it becomes evident that the word ""walm"" correlates with the repetition of the color that follows the word appearing directly before ""walm.""

Let's break down the examples:

1. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   Here, ""walm"" causes the color ""red"" (associated with ""wif"") to repeat three times.

2. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   Again, ""walm"" causes ""red"" to repeat three times after ""wif,"" and later it leads to ""yellow"" (associated with ""zup"") to repeat three times after another ""zup.""

3. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" and the color ""blue"" repeats three times.

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Following ""zup,"" the color ""yellow"" repeats three times because of ""walm.""

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   ""Walm"" makes ""red"" (corresponding to ""wif"") repeat three times, followed by the singular occurrence of ""green"" and ""yellow"" related to ""dax"" and ""zup"" respectively, without any repetition.

By observing these patterns, we can induce that ""walm"" means to repeat the output color that corresponds to the previous word three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup dax
    ",Output: blue yellow green,blue yellow green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of ""dax"" in this context, we need to compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs and look for patterns.

- Input: dax walm zup
  Output: green green green yellow
- Input: dax lug
  Output: green blue
- Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
  Output: yellow blue red green green red
- Input: zup dax bluf zup dax
  Output: yellow green green yellow green
- Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
  Output: green green red yellow blue

Examining the patterns:

1. Each time ""dax"" appears, the corresponding output color is ""green.""
2. The position of ""dax"" in the input does not affect its corresponding output color; it's always ""green.""

Given these observations, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Every time ""wif"" appears as part of the input, ""red"" appears in the output. Therefore, we can deduce the rule for ""wif.""

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's first align each ""zup"" in inputs with the respective outputs:

1. Input: zup lug zup lug wif -> Output: yellow blue yellow blue red
    - zup appears twice and is aligned with ""yellow"" both times.
   
2. Input: zup wif bluf -> Output: yellow red red 
    - zup appears once and is aligned with ""yellow.""
   
3. Input: zup lug wif dax lug -> Output: yellow blue red green blue
    - zup appears once and is aligned with ""yellow.""
   
4. Input: zup dax lug dax -> Output: yellow green blue green
    - zup appears once and is aligned with ""yellow.""
   
5. Input: zup lug dax -> Output: yellow blue green
    - zup appears once and is aligned with ""yellow.""

In all the given examples, the word ""zup"" corresponds exactly with the color ""yellow."" There is no deviation from this rule in the given examples, and thus we can induce that the rule is consistent.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> blue

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of the context in which it appears.
Based on the examples given, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be that it translates into repeating the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""walm."" The repetition count is three times. Here is how the rule applies to each given example:

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
Rule: ""wif"" means red, so ""walm"" repeats the associated color three times.

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
Rule: The last word before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" which means red, so ""walm"" repeats red three times following the ""wif.""

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red
Rule: The last word before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" which means green, so ""walm"" repeats green three times following the ""dax.""

Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
Rule: The first ""walm"" repeats the red from the preceding ""wif"" three times. The second ""walm"" repeats the blue from the preceding ""lug"" three times.

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
Rule: The last word before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" which means green, so ""walm"" repeats green three times following the ""dax.""

Therefore:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times. Rule: ""walm"" repeats the preceding color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif dax walm
    ",Output: blue red green green green green,blue red green green green,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
From the given examples, it appears that each time the word ""dax"" is used, the output includes the word ""green"". Thus, we can infer that ""dax"" correlates directly with the color green, regardless of its position in the input.

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" let's examine the inputs and their corresponding outputs in each example:

1. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red

2. Input: wif lug bluf wif zup
   Output: red blue blue red yellow

3. Input: wif zup bluf lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue

4. Input: wif lug wif
   Output: red blue red

5. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

Looking at the provided examples, ""wif"" always corresponds to the word ""red."" There is no context where ""wif"" corresponds to any other word or is influenced by adjacent words to change its meaning.

Thus, the rule we can induce from these examples is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. The other words in the examples appear to correspond to different colors: ""wif"" correlates with ""red"" and ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"".

The last example also confirms that the position of ""zup"" in a sequence (whether it is at the beginning, middle, or end) still results in the output ""yellow"". Additionally, the word ""walm"" does not overtly change the meaning of ""zup"", but seems to repeat the color associated with the preceding word, ""lug"", which is ""blue"".

Rule: zup -> ""yellow"". The meaning of ""zup"" is the color ""yellow"", regardless of its position or surrounding words in the input sequence.
bluf -> double the color that follows.

Rule: The word ""bluf"" duplicates the color word that comes after it in the sequence. If the color word is ""lug,"" which corresponds to the color blue, ""bluf lug"" results in ""blue blue."" Similarly, ""bluf wif"" results in ""red red,"" because ""wif"" stands for red. The color duplication occurs even when ""bluf"" is presented in the middle of a sequence, as demonstrated with ""wif bluf dax,"" which gives ""red red green""—""red"" being duplicated due to ""bluf"" preceding it.
Based on the examples provided, the output color changes according to the word that is paired with ""walm."" Each instance of ""walm"" is followed by a sequence of colors that match the color associated with the word before ""walm."" To be more precise:

- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red""
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green""
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue""

This pattern suggests that the word ""walm"" serves as a command to repeat the color associated with the previous word for as many times as the previous word itself appears before ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
When ""walm"" follows a word, the output is the color equivalent of that word repeated as many times as the word itself appears before ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word for the number of times that word appears before ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax lug walm
    ",Output: yellow green blue blue blue blue,yellow green blue blue blue,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, as evidenced by its consistent translation across all examples.
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the provided examples. Every instance of ""dax"" results in the output ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words.
wif -> red

Rule: The term ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be straightforward:

Rule: zup -> yellow

Each time the nonce word 'zup' appears in the input, it corresponds to the color 'yellow' in the output.
Given the examples provided, we can determine the following:

Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow
- Here bluf co-occurs with red just before it.

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
- Here bluf is followed by yellow, with red just before it.

Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
Output: green red green yellow yellow
- In this example, bluf is at the end and is preceded by yellow, while green comes before red.

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
- Here bluf directly follows dax and matches its color, green.

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green
- Again, bluf matches the color of the word just before it, which is red, and is followed by green.

Rule:
From the examples given, it seems that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it directly. If there are multiple ""bluf"" in sequence or ""bluf"" is at the beginning, it's possible additional information is needed to determine what ""bluf"" should be.

Hyper-specific rule based on the given examples:
bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word

Generalized rule interpretation:
bluf -> repeat the color assigned to the word immediately before bluf. If bluf is at the start or if there's uncertainty, it is possible that bluf could default to a specific color or require more context to determine its color.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" is directly associated with the output sequence of the color red. There is, however, a notable pattern: the occurrence of the color red repeats the number of times ""walm"" appears, plus one. To verify this, let's assess each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   - Here, ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow red.""

2. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - Here, ""walm"" corresponds to ""red red.""

3. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   - Here, the first ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue red,"" and the second ""walm"" corresponds to a single red, so each occurrence of ""walm"" seems to extend the sequence of red by one.

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - Here, ""walm"" corresponds to ""red red.""

5. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   - Here, ""walm"" corresponds to ""green yellow.""

From these examples, we can deduce the following rule for ""walm"": whenever ""walm"" appears, the color that immediately precedes it in the output is immediately followed by a sequence of reds, with the number of reds being one more than the number of instances of ""walm."" Additionally, ""walm"" does not seem to have a fixed associated color itself - it modifies the output by adding reds and is conditionally repeated based on its own presence. However, the dataset is inconsistent (as seen in example 5, where ""walm"" corresponds to green followed by yellow), so this rule may require further examples to be conclusively verified.

Rule: walm -> Increases the count of reds by one in the color sequence that follows its preceding color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in the provided examples.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" corresponds to a specific output color in the Output strings. Here's what we can deduce from each example:

Input: zup walm dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow green
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" also corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in this context

Input: lug dax
Output: blue green
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" again

Input: zup dax
Output: yellow green
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" yet again

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" at the start of the string
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" has not been defined, but by the process of elimination, it seems to correspond to ""yellow""

Input: wif dax
Output: red green
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

From these examples, we can deduce that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the Output, regardless of its position in the Input string.

Rule: dax -> green
After analyzing the given examples, it seems that ""wif"" indicates a switch in the output pattern that comes after it. Specifically, the color pattern appears to be altered when ""wif"" is used. It appears that ""wif"" causes the next color(s) in sequence to repeat the number of times equal to the number of syllables in the following word, before the pattern resets or a new pattern begins. 

Here is the rule induction based on the examples provided:

Input sequence: ""dax walm wif bluf""
Output: ""green green green red red""
- ""dax"" is followed by green.
- ""walm"" is followed by green.
- ""wif"" appears to add a switch, causing ""bluf"" (one syllable) to be represented by red, repeated once as per the single syllable in ""bluf"".

Input sequence: ""lug dax zup wif""
Output: ""blue green yellow red""
- ""lug"" is followed by blue.
- ""dax"" is followed by green.
- ""zup"" is followed by yellow.
- ""wif"" causes a switch, but without a following word to determine repetitions, the next color is red.

Input sequence: ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm""
Output: ""green red yellow yellow red red red""
- ""dax"" is followed by green.
- ""wif"" introduces a switch, changing the upcoming color to red.
- ""zup"" (one syllable) would cause a subsequent yellow, which repeats once.
- ""bluf"" (one syllable) coming after a previous switch does not repeat as ""wif"" is not directly before it.
- A second ""wif"" causes another switch, and now ""walm"" (one syllable) causes the subsequent red to repeat once.

Input sequence: ""dax wif walm lug zup walm""
Output: ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow""
- ""dax"" is followed by green.
- ""wif"" indicates a switch, causing the following word ""walm"" (one syllable) to be red, repeated once.
- ""lug"" follows its regular pattern and is blue.
- ""zup"" is yellow, followed by ""walm"" in its regular pattern, repeated for the number of syllables which is once (making it three yellows total).

Input sequence: ""wif dax zup dax""
Output: ""red green yellow green""
- ""wif"" introduces a switch to red as it's the first word,
- ""dax"" follows its regular pattern of green.
- ""zup"" is yellow.
- ""dax"" appears again as green.

Based on the above observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif causes the color pattern after it to switch, and the immediately following word then defines the number of times the next color in the sequence is repeated according to the number of syllables in that word.

Therefore:
wif -> causes a switch in the color output pattern, repeating the subsequent color based on the syllable count of the next word.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
Considering the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sentence. It should be noted that the presence of ""lug"" after ""bluf"" results in the output ""red red blue,"" implying ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and does not affect the output associated with ""bluf."" 

Therefore, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the color ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in each input and the corresponding output colors:

1. ""dax walm zup lug dax"" corresponds to ""green green green yellow blue green.""
2. ""lug walm zup wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue yellow red.""
3. ""dax wif walm"" corresponds to ""green red red red.""
4. ""dax walm lug"" corresponds to ""green green green blue.""
5. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red.""

From the examples provided, we can notice that ""walm"" is associated with a color that repeats itself, typically the one directly preceding ""walm"". A pattern that follows is that the word after ""walm"" changes color, usually not following the pattern set before ""walm"".

Checking the examples:

- In the first example, ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" which is green, and it continues being green after ""walm.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" which is blue, and it continues being blue a total of three times after ""walm.""
- In the third and fourth examples, the color before ""walm"" is repeated for every occurrence of ""walm.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and is yellow, and right after ""walm,"" ""dax"" is yellow, which is a deviation from its usual green, suggesting that ""walm"" might cause the following word to adopt the color of the word before ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> ""repeat the color of the previous word and the next word adopts the same color.""

A slight deviation is with ""lug walm zup wif"" (example 2), where the pattern suggests ""walm"" continues with ""blue"" twice after ""zup,"" but it's uncertain why it would continue beyond just the next word. Additionally, in the fifth example, ""walm"" seems to alter the color of two subsequent words, not just one. Given the limited data, it appears that ""walm"" causes a repeat in the preceding color and may influence the color of the following word (or words), but without more patterns or a clear rule, there's room for ambiguity in the extent of the influence. Therefore, based on the data we have:

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding word's color to repeat; the following word(s) may also change to this color to some extent.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm dax
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow green,yellow yellow yellow green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green."" Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. No other context is provided that might alter the meaning of ""dax,"" and it consistently translates to the same color regardless of its position in a list of terms.

Rule: dax -> green
To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we'll look for patterns in the input-output pairs. Here are the inputs and outputs provided with the occurrences of ""wif"" highlighted:

Input: wif bluf | Output: red red
Input: wif bluf | Output: red red
Input: wif dax zup walm | Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
Input: zup bluf wif dax lug | Output: yellow yellow red green blue
Input: wif lug zup bluf | Output: red blue yellow yellow

Initially, we'll hypothesize a rule for ""wif"" and then test it against the examples. Here's a potential hypothesis:

Rule: ""wif"" always translates to ""red.""

Now, let's test this hypothesis against the examples provided.

1. When ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red."" This suggests that ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" might also translate to ""red"" or there is some repetition rule at play.
2. The second input and output are identical to the first, which reinforces the previous observation.
3. ""wif"" is followed by ""dax zup walm,"" and the output starts with ""red."" This is consistent with the hypothesis. The rest of the output (green yellow yellow yellow) does not provide additional information about ""wif"" specifically.
4. ""wif"" is preceded by ""zup bluf"" and followed by ""dax lug."" The corresponding output is ""yellow yellow red green blue,"" and ""wif"" still translates to ""red.""
5. ""wif"" is followed by ""lug zup bluf,"" and the output is ""red blue yellow yellow."" Again, ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

Testing the hypothesis that ""wif"" always translates to ""red"" against all the given examples shows that this rule holds consistently in every instance.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" When ""zup"" is followed by other words, it still translates to ""yellow,"" and the subsequent words correspond to additional colors, based on a mapping that is consistent across examples. Here are the observed mappings:

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- walm -> red (from the second example, ""walm"" appears to have the same output color as ""wif"")
- dax -> green

Thus, the rule can be expressed as:

Rule: zup -> yellow

Additional correlations:
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- walm -> red
- dax -> green

""Zup"" by itself always results in ""yellow,"" and when followed by additional words, the sequence of colors starts with yellow (zup's color) followed by the colors associated with each of the subsequent words.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue. Every time ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output in the same position. The meaning of ""bluf"" does not appear to change depending on the context of the other words surrounding it, suggesting that ""bluf"" deterministically represents the color blue.

Rule: bluf -> blue.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we'll look for patterns related to ""walm"" in the input and corresponding patterns in the output.

1. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

2. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

3. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green

4. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

Considering each of these examples, we notice that:

- The word preceding ""walm"" in the input is always output as a color repeated three times.
- The word ""walm"" itself in the output is always ""blue.""
- The occurrence of ""walm"" does not affect the color associated with words that come after it in the input. For example, in ""dax walm zup lug dax,"" the ""dax"" after ""walm"" still corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

Therefore, we can induce that the rule for ""walm"" is to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""walm"" three times, and then ""walm"" itself translates to ""blue.""

Rule: walm -> Take the color associated with the word directly before ""walm,"" repeat it three times, and then add ""blue"" for ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax
    ",Output: yellow green,yellow green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the examples provided:

- wif lug dax -> red blue green (Here, 'wif' may represent 'red' and 'dax' may represent 'green'.)
- zup lug -> yellow blue (Here, 'zup' may represent 'yellow'.)
- lug -> blue (Here, there are no other words, suggesting 'lug' directly correlates with 'blue'.)
- wif lug -> red blue (Here, 'wif' again seems to correspond with 'red', supporting the association. 'lug' remains consistent with 'blue'.)
- wif lug -> red blue (This is a repetition of the previous input, further reinforcing the association between 'wif' and 'red', and 'lug' and 'blue'.)

Therefore, the consistent element across all examples is that 'lug' translates to the color 'blue'.
Based on the provided examples, it is evident that the word 'dax' consistently translates to the color 'green' in the Output. The following are the relationships established from the Input and Output examples:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- walm -> green

Each non-dax word is mapped to a unique color in the output, whereas the word 'dax' always maps to the color green, regardless of its position or the words around it.

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green
Based on the examples given, it appears that each nonce word has a corresponding color output. The word ""wif"" consistently leads to the output ""red."" Here are the associations for the provided examples:

- wif -> red
- walm -> yellow
- bluf -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow

Therefore, the rule seems to be that each nonce word is assigned a specific color. The word ""wif"" correlates directly to the color red each time it appears.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"", regardless of its position in the sequence. Every instance of ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow"".
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we should look at the patterns in the examples provided. The word ""bluf"" appears in five different contexts, and each time it is translated to a specific color in the output:

1. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm → Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
2. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax → Output: blue green green red green
3. Input: dax bluf wif lug zup → Output: green green red blue yellow
4. Input: dax zup lug bluf → Output: green yellow blue blue
5. Input: lug wif lug bluf → Output: blue red blue blue

In all the examples, ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue."" 

Rule: bluf -> blue
To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" based on the given examples, let's analyze the inputs and outputs:

1. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   Here, 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', and 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'. 'walm' results in 'blue blue'.

2. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   Here, 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', 'bluf' to 'yellow', and 'wif' to 'red'. 'walm' results in 'red red'.

3. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   Here, 'dax' corresponds to 'green', 'wif' to 'red', 'zup' to 'yellow', and 'bluf' to 'yellow'. 'walm' results in 'red red'.

4. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   Here, 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', 'wif' to 'red', 'dax' to 'green', and 'lug' to 'blue'. After 'walm', the color 'green' is repeated.

5. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow
   Here, 'dax' corresponds to 'green', 'wif' to 'red', 'lug' to 'blue', and 'zup' to 'yellow'. 'walm' results in 'red' being repeated.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" in the context affects the preceding color word by repeating it one or two times. It seems to double the previous color most of the time but triples if the previous color is 'red'. Given the limited examples, the repetition may depend on the particular color word that precedes ""walm"". So far, we see 'blue' repeated once and 'red' repeated twice when 'walm' follows. 

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the previous color word, specifically red is repeated three times, while the other colors are repeated once.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax wif
    ",Output: blue green red,blue green red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of what precedes it.
From the provided examples, we can infer the following:

- ""lug"" is translated to ""blue"".
- ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow"".
- ""dax"" is translated to ""green"".
- ""wif"" is always translated to ""red"".
- ""bluf"" is consistently translated to ""green"".

With this in mind, the rule for ""wif"" can be determined. Regardless of what comes before or after, ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red"". There's no variation in output related to the context; therefore, the meaning does not seem to be dependent on the adjacent words but is an independent translation.

Rule: wif -> ""red"".
Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the word ""zup"" in the context:

- Example 1 (Input: zup wif bluf / Output: yellow red red): ""zup"" appears first and is followed by two colours, ""wif"" and ""bluf."" Because ""wif"" and ""bluf"" correspond to the colors ""red"" and ""red"" respectively in the output, ""zup"" therefore corresponds to ""yellow.""
- Example 2 (Input: lug zup wif / Output: blue yellow red): Here, ""zup"" is in the middle and results in ""yellow"" in the output.
- Example 3 (Input: lug zup wif / Output: blue yellow red): This is identical to Example 2, providing the same output, which reinforces the association of ""zup"" with ""yellow.""
- Example 4 (Input: dax walm wif zup / Output: green green green red yellow): ""zup"" is at the end of the sequence and again corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.
- Example 5 (Input: lug zup / Output: blue yellow): ""zup"" follows ""lug"" and results in ""yellow,"" consistent with the previous patterns.

Considering all these examples, it seems evident that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the outputs provided, no matter its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" refers to the color immediately preceding it in the sequence. In other words, ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word.

For verification, let's look at each example:

1. Input: lug bluf zup lug
   Output: blue blue yellow blue
   - Here ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which translates to ""blue"", so ""bluf"" is also ""blue"".

2. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green
   - ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which translates to ""green"", hence ""bluf"" is ""green"".

3. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   - ""bluf"" again follows ""dax"" and matches its color ""green"".

4. Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
   Output: green green red blue yellow
   - ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" translating to ""green"", followed by ""wif"" (red), ""lug"" (blue), and ""zup"" (yellow).

5. Input: zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow yellow blue
   - ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" translating to ""yellow"".

From the patterns, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that comes before it. If ""bluf"" is the first word and there is no preceding color word, the current examples don't provide a rule for this; all instances of ""bluf"" follow another color word.

Rule: bluf -> Takes the color value of the preceding word in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs and corresponding outputs to look for patterns relating to the occurrence of ""walm.""

Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow
- ""dax"" and ""walm"" lead to ""green,"" but ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
- Here, ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"" again; ""bluf"" is yellow too, ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" leads to three occurrences of ""red.""

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue
- ""zup"" stays consistent with ""yellow,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" ""walm"" leads to two more instances of ""red,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue.""

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue
- ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" leads to ""blue.""

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
- ""dax"" and ""walm"" produce ""green,"" and ""wif"" is ""red.""

Observations:
- The presence of ""dax"" always results in ""green,"" ""zup"" in ""yellow,"" ""wif"" in ""red,"" and ""lug"" in ""blue.""
- The color following ""walm"" seems to depend on the word that comes after it. In these examples, ""walm"" doesn't produce a fixed color but rather affects the next word's color.

Deduction:
- When ""walm"" precedes ""zup,"" the result is ""yellow,"" which is consistent with the color associated with ""zup.""
- When ""walm"" precedes ""lug,"" the output is ""blue"" twice, consistent with the color associated with ""lug.""
- However, when ""walm"" precedes ""wif,"" the output is ""red red,"" which is different because ""wif"" usually corresponds to a single ""red."" So, ""walm"" when followed by ""wif,"" seems to double the occurrence of the color associated with ""wif."" 
- Additionally, when ""walm"" follows ""dax"" or ""wif,"" one of the occurrences of ""green"" or ""red"" may actually be attributed to ""walm.""

Given these patterns, an initial hypothesis for the rule might be that ""walm"" repeats the color of the next word, except when it follows the words that have a consistent color pattern (like ""dax"" or ""wif""), where it might be attributing to the current color. Additionally, when there isn't a word after ""walm,"" it defaults to the color of the last word it was associated with (""blue"" in the third example).

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the color associated with the following word, potentially contributing to the color of the preceding word when immediately following it. If it is the last word, take the color of the last word it influenced.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of other words or their positions in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's analyze how its output changes with respect to its position and surrounding words.

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

In this example, ""dax"" precedes two other words, and the output for ""dax"" is green.

Input: zup dax
Output: yellow green

Here, ""dax"" follows another word, and the output is green again. This might indicate that the position of ""dax"" does not affect its meaning.

Input: dax zup
Output: green yellow

""Zup"" follows ""dax"" again, but regardless of what follows, ""dax"" results in green, which reinforces the idea that the position does not change its meaning.

Input: dax lug wif bluf
Output: green blue red red

Once again, ""dax"" yields a green output regardless of the words following it.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

""Dax"" remains associated with the color green no matter what follows.

Based on the above examples, we can deduce that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position or the words that follow or precede it.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" consistently. Each time the word ""wif"" is present in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Thus, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that zup consistently corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position or the context within the sequence of words.

Thus, the rule is: zup -> yellow.
bluf -> yellow

Rule: The word ""bluf"" is consistently translated to the color ""yellow"" in the provided examples.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to repeat the last color mentioned in the input three times. The repetition seems to depend on the preceding color word in the input, which defines the color to repeat.

Here are the observations:

- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow,"" so ""zup"" means ""yellow"" and ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""yellow"" three times.
- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue,"" so ""lug"" means ""blue"" and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times.
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" outputs ""red red green green green,"" where ""wif"" means ""red,"" ""bluf"" means ""green,"" ""dax"" has no apparent meaning (since its color does not appear in the output), and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times.
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow red red red,"" so following the same logic, ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color word that comes directly before it three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last color mentioned before the word ""walm"" three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the given examples.
dax -> meaning. Meaning: green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let us examine the placement and outputs given in each example:

1. Input: lug wif  -> Output: blue red
2. Input: lug zup dax wif zup -> Output: blue yellow green red yellow
3. Input: zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red
4. Input: wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green
5. Input: lug zup wif -> Output: blue yellow red

Looking at the first example, we see that ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and when followed by ""wif,"" we get ""red."" Thus, we might assume that ""wif"" translates directly to ""red.""

However, in the other examples, we have ""wif"" preceded or followed by other nonce words, and the output invariably includes ""red"" at the point where ""wif"" is used in the input, e.g.,:

- In the second example, ""wif"" is followed by ""zup,"" and the corresponding output is ""red yellow.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in ""red red red.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" is at the start, and it produces ""red"" at the beginning of the output.
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" is at the end of the sequence, and ""red"" is at the end of the output.

From these observations, we can infer the rule regarding ""wif"" as follows:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Therefore:
wif -> red
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" by examining the corresponding outputs:

1. ""zup bluf wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red"". 
2. ""dax zup dax zup wif"" translates to ""green yellow green yellow red"".
3. ""zup lug"" translates to ""yellow blue"".
4. ""dax zup lug wif lug"" translates to ""green yellow blue red blue"".

We can observe that every time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output. Additionally, we can see that the other words (""bluf"", ""dax"", ""lug"", ""wif"") also correspond to consistent color outputs, suggesting that each nonce word translates to a specific color. Therefore, we can infer the rule as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"", we will look at the correspondence between the input and the output words, focusing on their positions and the appearance of ""bluf"".

From the examples given:

1. Input: dax zup bluf | Output: green yellow yellow
2. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug | Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
3. Input: dax zup bluf | Output: green yellow yellow
4. Input: dax lug bluf | Output: green blue blue
5. Input: wif bluf | Output: red red

We can see that whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input:

- In ""dax zup bluf"" and ""zup dax bluf"", the ""bluf"" maps to ""yellow"", which follows ""dax"" and ""zup"".
- In ""dax lug bluf"", ""bluf"" maps to ""blue"", which follows ""lug"".
- In ""wif bluf"", ""bluf"" maps to ""red"", which follows ""wif"".

From these correlations, we can observe that the word ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the list.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.
Walm -> Rule: Repeat the color of the previous word.

Let's check this rule against the provided examples:

1. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Explanation: The word 'walm' repeats the color of 'lug', which is blue. Hence, 'blue blue'.

2. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   Explanation: 'zup' is yellow, so 'walm' following 'zup' results in two yellows.

3. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   Explanation: 'walm' comes after 'wif' which is red, hence it results in a sequence of reds before 'lug'.

4. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
   Explanation: 'walm' after 'lug' (which is blue) results in another blue, and the pattern continues until the next word.

From all the examples, whenever 'walm' appears, it repeats the color of the word immediately before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug
    ",Output: red blue,red blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The term ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the other words present in the input. The other words (wif, dax, zup) each correspond to their own color (red, green, yellow respectively) when they appear before ""lug.""
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or other words present.
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""wif"" does not represent a consistent color but rather an operation or transformation within the sequence. The presence of the word ""wif"" correlates with certain changes in the color pattern. 

Specifically, whenever ""wif"" occurs between two words, the output contains ""red"" in the place of ""wif"":

- dax **wif** lug dax -> green **red** blue green
- lug **wif** -> blue **red**
- wif dax -> **red** green
- wif lug -> **red** blue
- zup lug **wif** -> yellow blue **red**

Thus, we can deduce:

**wif** -> **meaning**: When ""wif"" is present, it transforms into ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position between words.

**Rule**: Whenever ""wif"" is encountered in the input, the word ""red"" is used in the corresponding output position.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look at the patterns relating inputs to their corresponding outputs. In each example, the word ""zup"" is always translated into the color ""yellow.""

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
- ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow.""

Input: lug walm zup walm
Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
- Here again, ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow.""

Input: lug zup lug
Output: blue yellow blue
- Once again, ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow.""

Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
- ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow"" in two instances.

Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
- ""zup"" is translated as ""yellow"" in two instances.

Based on these examples, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input string or the surrounding words.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: Each instance of the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red"" in the output. 

Bluf -> red.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" in the context of this problem correlates to repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it multiple times in the output. Let's analyze the examples to determine how many times the color is repeated:

1. Input: ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug""
   Output: ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue""
   
   The word ""lug"" (which precedes ""walm"") corresponds to the color ""blue"" and after ""walm"" we see ""blue"" repeated three times.
   
2. Input: ""wif lug walm""
   Output: ""red blue blue blue""
   
   ""Lug"" (before ""walm"") corresponds to ""blue"", and ""blue"" is repeated three times after ""walm.""
   
3. Input: ""lug walm""
   Output: ""blue blue blue""
   
   ""Lug"" (before ""walm"") corresponds to ""blue"", and ""blue"" is repeated three times after ""walm.""
   
4. Input: ""zup lug walm""
   Output: ""yellow blue blue blue""
   
   ""Lug"" (preceding ""walm"") corresponds to ""blue"", and ""blue"" is repeated three times post ""walm.""
   
5. Input: ""wif dax lug walm""
   Output: ""red green blue blue blue""
   
   ""Lug"" (prior to ""walm"") corresponds to ""blue"", and ""blue"" is repeated three times in the sequence after ""walm.""

In every instance, the presence of ""walm"" results in three instances of the color that is linked to the word directly preceding ""walm."" Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" is used, it results in the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given input and output examples, the rule seems to be straightforward:

lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Each time ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, ""green"" appears at the corresponding position in the output. Meanwhile, the other words appear to be associated with different colors (""zup"" with yellow, ""lug"" with blue, ""wif"" with red, etc.), and their positions do not affect the color they are associated with. Therefore, ""dax"" seems to mean green, regardless of its position in the list.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" appears to have a consistent translation to ""red"" irrespective of its position in the sequence:

Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
Input: zup bluf wif lug dax -> Output: yellow yellow red blue green
Input: wif zup lug zup lug -> Output: red yellow blue yellow blue
Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue

Rule:
wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it can be inferred that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the outputs. There is no example in which ""zup"" correlates with any other word or pattern that deviates from ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" translates to the same color as the word that precedes it. Here is the analysis:

- In the first example, ""lug"" translates to blue, and ""bluf"" following it also translates to blue.
- In the second example, ""wif"" translates to red, and both occurrences of ""bluf"" following ""wif"" translate to red. 
- In the third example, ""dax"" translates to green, and ""bluf"" following it translates to green.
- In the fourth example, when ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" it translates to blue, and when ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it translates to green.
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" translates to yellow, and ""bluf"" following it translates to yellow.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word that comes directly before it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's look for patterns in the given examples.

In the first Input ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif"", the Output is ""blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red"". The word ""lug"" is followed by ""blue"", and ""wif"" is followed by ""red"". The sequence ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color that preceded it. For instance, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"".

Following this pattern, let's examine other inputs:

Input: ""zup walm wif"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow yellow red"". Here, ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" again leads to the repetition of ""yellow"".

Input: ""wif walm dax"" -> Output: ""red red red green"". ""Wif"" again corresponds to ""red"", and ""walm"" leads to repeating ""red"". ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Input: ""lug walm zup walm"" -> Output: ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow"". Consistent with previous findings, ""lug"" leads to ""blue"", ""walm"" repeats ""blue"", ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" again repeats ""yellow"".

Input: ""lug zup walm lug"" -> Output: ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". Following the established pattern, ""lug"" and ""zup"" give ""blue"" and ""yellow"" respectively, and ""walm"" repeats the previous color, in this case, ""yellow"".

From the inputs and outputs provided, it seems that ""walm"" signals the repetition of the last mentioned color.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" is:

walm -> Repeat the color immediately preceding this word.

Rule: When ""walm"" is encountered, repeat the color of the previous word in the sequence as many times until a new word with a different color is encountered.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf
    ",Output: yellow yellow,yellow yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue."" Therefore, the rule is as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we look for the pattern in each input/output.

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

Input: wif dax
Output: red green

Input: lug bluf dax bluf
Output: blue blue green green

Input: dax bluf lug wif
Output: green green blue red

Input: dax wif
Output: green red

The word ""dax"" in each input consistently results in the output ""green."" Regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the sequence or the surrounding words, it correlates to the color green.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Each time ""wif"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the respective position in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> meaning: yellow. 

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the outputs provided regardless of its position or the other words surrounding it.
Based on the input and output examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds consistently with the word ""red"" in the outputs:

- ""zup bluf wif"" -> ""yellow yellow red""
- ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" -> ""green green red yellow green""
- ""zup bluf wif bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow red red""
- ""lug bluf wif"" -> ""blue blue red""
- ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" -> ""green blue yellow red red green""

Thus, the rule that can be deduced is:

Rule: bluf -> red
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I will analyze the given examples and outputs to establish a pattern or rule.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

Input: lug walm wif lug
Output: blue blue blue red blue

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

Looking at the examples provided, it seems that the output color for ""walm"" depends on the word that precedes it. Specifically, the color for ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the previous word. Let's verify this pattern with the examples:

- In the first example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""walm"" outputs three ""blue"" colors.
- In the second example, ""walm"" outputs three ""yellow"" colors following ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow.
- In the third example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" hence ""walm"" outputs three ""blue"" colors.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" so ""walm"" outputs three ""red"" colors.
- In the fifth example, the pattern holds as ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" resulting in three ""blue"" colors.

Based on this analysis, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be that it results in three repetitions of the color corresponding to the word that comes directly before it.

Rule: walm -> Outputs three instances of the color corresponding to the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif zup dax
    ",Output: green red yellow green,green red yellow green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Given the examples, it seems that each word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in each example it appears. Thus, the rule can be inferred as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the given examples, the rule for ""dax"" seems to correlate with the output ""green"". Each time ""dax"" is present in the input, the word ""green"" is part of the output. 

The other words do not have a consistent one-to-one correlation with the other colors in the output (for example, ""wif"" and ""walm"" both produce ""red"" in the second example, but ""wif"" is correlated with ""yellow"" and ""walm"" with ""green"" in another example), so it is not possible to deduce their meanings with certainty. However, ""dax"" consistently correlates with ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in each given example.
Rule: zup -> yellow
Considering the various inputs and outputs provided, we notice that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. The given task appears to require us to match the nonce word ""bluf"" to its corresponding color representation. Below is the breakdown of each input-output pair and the identification process for ""bluf"":

1. Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
   Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green
   Analysis: ""bluf"" appears twice in the input and corresponds to ""blue"" in the output each time it appears.

2. Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
   Output: green green red yellow blue
   Analysis: ""bluf"" appears once after ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green,"" but since ""bluf"" also followed ""dax"" in the first example and represented ""blue,"" the presence of ""dax"" before ""bluf"" doesn’t seem to affect the color represented by ""bluf."" 

3. Input: zup bluf lug zup
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow
   Analysis: ""bluf"" appears once and corresponds to ""blue,"" and the context does not appear to change its meaning.

4. Input: zup lug bluf
   Output: yellow blue blue
   Analysis: ""bluf"" appears once and corresponds to ""blue."" The previous words do not seem to affect its meaning.

5. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
   Analysis: This example is a mistake considering the pattern identified so far. ""bluf"" was expected to correspond to ""blue,"" not ""red."" It could be an error in the input or output, or there might be an additional context-specific rule not able to be defined by the given examples.

From the analysis of the consistent examples (1, 2, 3, and 4), ""bluf"" appears to always be associated with the color ""blue,"" regardless of its position or surrounding words. The fifth input-output pair, however, does not fit this pattern. It can either be an outlier or an indication of an additional rule that is not apparent from the provided examples alone. Given this inconsistency, we will base the rule on the majority of the consistent data points.

Rule: bluf -> blue
To decipher the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the given examples and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

2. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red

3. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red

4. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green

5. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red

Let's analyze the walm occurrences and their immediate contexts:

In Example 1, ""wif walm"" generates ""red red red yellow,"" and in the second occurrence, it's the same: ""red red red yellow."" Before and after ""wif walm,"" the pattern is consistent.

In Example 2, ""wif walm lug"" produces ""red red red."" In this example, ""walm"" follows after ""wif"" and before ""lug,"" and both instances of ""walm"" are surrounded by ""wif"" and ""lug"" sequences result in the pattern ""red red red.""

In Example 3, ""wif walm"" again leads to the sequence ""red red red.""

In Example 4, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" but here, ""walm"" follows ""dax."" It's important to note that when ""dax"" is in front of ""walm,"" we see ""green"" repeated three times.

In Example 5, ""dax walm"" yields the same pattern as in Example 4: ""green green green.""

Based on this analysis, ""walm"" seems to be a modifier that takes the color of the word before it and repeats that color three times. Therefore, ""walm"" makes the preceding color result in a threefold sequence. However, if ""walm"" is used after ""wif,"" it seems to transition from red to yellow.

Taking all of this into account:
Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word preceding it to repeat three times. If ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the color pattern is ""red red red yellow"" instead of ""red red red red.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Through analyzing the input-output pairs, I observe the following:

1. Whenever ""lug"" appears, the word ""blue"" is in the corresponding position in the output sequence, regardless of the other words.
2. The presence of other words in the input does not affect the output associated with ""lug.""

Based on these observations, it seems that ""lug"" corresponds directly to the color ""blue"" in the outputs. No other words in the input affect the translation of ""lug"" into ""blue,"" indicating that the meaning of ""lug"" is independent of context in these examples.

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word dax consistently translates to the color green in all examples provided.
Based on the examples given, it's possible to deduce that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Every time ""wif"" appears in an input, the color ""red"" appears in the output. No other part of the input changes the output related to the word ""wif."" Consequently, the rule is as follows:

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze each input-output pair:

1. Input: zup bluf lug -> Output: yellow yellow blue
    - We see that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

2. Input: dax bluf wif zup -> Output: green green red yellow
    - We see that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" again corresponds to ""yellow.""

3. Input: zup bluf lug dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow blue green blue
    - Here again ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

4. Input: dax bluf zup -> Output: green green yellow
    - ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

5. Input: dax lug bluf dax -> Output: green blue blue green
    - ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

We can note that:

- When ""bluf"" is immediately preceded by ""zup,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" is immediately preceded by ""dax,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" is immediately preceded by ""lug,"" considering the last example, although ""bluf"" is not directly preceded by ""lug,"" we see that the instance of ""bluf"" still corresponds with the color ""blue."" However, this rule is not strictly based on the preceding word, as shown in the earlier examples.

Thus, based on these observations, we can infer the following rule:

**Rule:** The meaning of ""bluf"" in the output corresponds to the color of the word that directly precedes ""bluf"" in the input.

Therefore, the rule is:

bluf -> The color of the word that comes directly before it.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the examples provided:

- In each instance, when ""walm"" is present, the word that immediately follows in the output is ""yellow.""
- It seems that ""walm"" does not influence any other word than the one that directly follows it in the sequence.

Based on these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, it causes the very next word to be represented by the color ""yellow"" in the output. If there is no word following ""walm,"" then ""walm"" itself is represented as ""yellow.""

Thus, our definition in the requested format:

walm -> When placed before a word, it changes the color assigned to that word to ""yellow."" If there is no subsequent word, then ""walm"" is assigned the color ""yellow.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> ""blue""

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the word ""dax"" by looking at the output associated with each input that contains ""dax."" Let's examine:

1. Input: dax lug wif walm -> Output: green blue red red red
2. Input: dax lug bluf wif -> Output: green blue blue red
3. Input: dax -> Output: green
4. Input: dax lug -> Output: green blue
5. Input: dax -> Output: green

In each of the inputs where ""dax"" appears, the word ""green"" appears in the output at the position corresponding to ""dax."" From this, it seems reasonable to deduce that the word ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule underlying the nonce word 'zup'. Let's analyze the pairs of input and output to find a correlation.

Input: dax wif zup dax
Output: green red yellow green
- 'zup' appears between 'wif' and 'dax,' which correspond to 'red' and 'green,' respectively, and here 'zup' translates to 'yellow.'

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
- 'zup' follows 'walm' which corresponds to 'blue,' and precedes 'wif' which corresponds to 'red,' here 'zup' translates to 'yellow.'

Input: dax zup wif
Output: green yellow red
- 'zup' is between 'dax' and 'wif,' which correspond to 'green' and 'red,' respectively, and in this context, 'zup' means 'yellow.'

Input: wif zup lug wif
Output: red yellow blue red
- 'zup' is positioned between two instances of 'wif,' the first and last word of the sequence, both corresponding to 'red.' Here, 'zup' translates to 'yellow,' while 'lug' translates to 'blue.'

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red
- 'zup' precedes 'wif' and 'bluf,' which both correspond to 'red.' In this scenario, 'zup' also translates to 'yellow.'

Based on the examples provided, it appears that 'zup' consistently translates to 'yellow' regardless of its position or the surrounding words.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> red

Rule: The word 'bluf' corresponds to the color 'red'. This is consistent across all examples provided. Whenever 'bluf' appears in the input, 'red' appears in the corresponding position in the output.
Based on the examples, the word ""walm"" changes its output according to the word that precedes it. Specifically, for each unique word before ""walm,"" it repeats the color corresponding to that word a certain number of times:

- ""lug zup dax walm"" outputs ""blue yellow green green green,"" where ""green"" corresponds to ""dax,"" and it is repeated three times.
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" outputs ""red red green green green,"" where again, ""green"" is repeated three times.
- ""dax wif walm"" outputs ""green red red red,"" where ""red"" corresponds to ""wif,"" and it is repeated three times.
- ""wif dax lug walm"" outputs ""red green blue blue blue,"" where ""blue"" corresponds to ""lug,"" and it is repeated three times.
- ""lug dax walm"" outputs ""blue green green green,"" where ""green"" is repeated three times.

Hence, the word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color that matches the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf
    ",Output: yellow red,yellow yellow,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the outputs. Each example provided contains ""lug"" and corresponds to ""blue"" in the respective output, regardless of the position of ""lug"" in the input sequence or the other words present.

Hence, we can induce the following rule:

lug -> meaning: blue
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, we can see that every time the word ""wif"" appears, it corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sentence or the words it is adjacent to. Thus, we can deduce:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word that immediately precedes it. Looking closely at the inputs and corresponding outputs:

1. ""zup bluf"" => ""yellow yellow,"" showing that ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup.""
2. ""lug bluf"" => ""blue blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" when it follows ""lug.""
3. ""dax bluf"" => ""green green,"" which means that ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" when it follows ""dax.""
4. ""wif bluf"" => ""red red,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" when it follows ""wif.""

There is a one-to-one correspondence between the color before ""bluf"" and the color outputted for ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color value of the preceding word.
Analyzing the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the word ""walm"" based on the colors that follow each time it is used in a sentence and the surrounding words which also seem to correspond to specific colors:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow

Now let's try to distill the rule for ""walm"":

1. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   In this sequence, ""walm"" leads to a repetition of ""yellow"" three times.

2. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   Here, ""walm"" has the output ""red"" repeated three times, which is associated with ""wif"".

3. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   In this case, ""walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated three times, tied to ""lug"".

4. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red
   ""walm"" is followed by ""green"" repeated three times, which is connected with ""dax"".

5. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   Here, ""walm"" produces ""blue"" repeated three times once again, which follows ""lug"".

From these examples, we can infer that ""walm"" indicates the repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""walm"". The number of repetitions is consistent across the examples as well, with the color being repeated three times. 

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

For example:
- when ""lug"" (blue) precedes ""walm"", the output color blue is repeated three times;
- when ""wif"" (red) precedes ""walm"", the output color red is repeated three times, etc.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif
    ",Output: blue red,blue red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: lug translates to the color blue.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's look at the given input/output pairs and find the patterns.

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red

- Here, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" and both are translated as ""green.""

Input: dax
Output: green

- ""dax"" by itself is translated as ""green.""

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green

- ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf,"" and both result in ""green.""

Input: wif zup dax bluf
Output: red yellow green green

- ""dax"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""bluf,"" with ""dax"" corresponding to ""green"" again.

Input: zup dax wif
Output: yellow green red

- Once again, ""dax"" follows ""zup"" and is translated as ""green.""

Based on these observations, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position or the words that follow or precede it.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" is used in the input, the color ""red"" is included in the same position in the output. There are no instances where ""wif"" does not translate to ""red."" Therefore, the rule can be defined as follows:

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""zup"" functions as a rule or command that dictates the following behavior: when ""zup"" is stated before a sequence of nonce words, those nonce words prompt a corresponding color output.

Here is how ""zup"" correlates to the outputs:

- ""zup walm"" leads to the output ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which suggests that ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- For ""zup wif,"" the output is ""yellow red,"" indicating that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- ""zup lug"" leads to ""yellow blue,"" indicating that ""lug"" is associated with the color ""blue.""
- ""zup dax lug wif dax"" leads to ""yellow green blue red green,"" which suggests that ""dax"" must correspond to the color ""green.""
- Finally, when ""zup"" stands alone, it outputs ""yellow,"" which implies that ""zup"" itself is associated with the color ""yellow.""

Additionally, since ""zup"" appears at the beginning of every input, we can infer that it is a control word that initiates the sequence of colors. Therefore, it seems that the presence of ""zup"" indicates that each subsequent word must be translated into its associated color.

Rule: ""zup"" precedes a sequence of nonce words, each of which corresponds to a color. If ""zup"" is used alone, it outputs the color ""yellow."" If other nonce words follow ""zup,"" those words are translated into their respective colors. Here are the mappings based on the examples:

- zup -> yellow
- walm -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green

Thus, the rule can be summarized as:

zup -> Start a color sequence, where ""zup"" and specific other nonce words are translated into designated colors based on their mappings.
To deduce what ""bluf"" means, we should look for patterns in the provided examples. Let's examine each instance of ""bluf"" and its corresponding output.

1. 
Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

Here ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the corresponding color is yellow. 

2.
Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green

Here ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the corresponding color is green. 

3.
Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red

Here ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" leading to a blue output, and then follows ""zup"" leading to a yellow output.

4.
Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

Like the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output is yellow.

5.
Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red

In this example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the corresponding color is red.

Now let's try to infer the rule:

The output color for ""bluf"" matches the color output of the word that immediately precedes it. Examples: 

- In the first and fourth examples, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and they both correspond to yellow.
- In the second example, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and they both correspond to green.
- In the third example, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" which corresponds to blue and ""zup"" precedes the second ""bluf"" which corresponds to yellow.
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and they both correspond to red.

Hence, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word before it.

Rule:
bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" means to repeat the color of the preceding word in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" by comparing the inputs and outputs.

1. Input: zup wif walm 
   Output: yellow red red red

2. Input: lug wif zup wif walm 
   Output: blue red yellow red red red

3. Input: dax walm wif walm 
   Output: green green green red red red

4. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue

5. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red

Looking at the first three examples, we note that ""walm"" always translates to a repetition of the color immediately before it, repeated three times. For example:

- In example 1, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" so ""walm"" becomes ""red red red.""
- In example 2, despite the repeated ""wif zup,"" which gives us ""red yellow,"" ""walm"" again gives us ""red red red,"" following the first instance of ""wif"". 
- In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which is ""green"", so ""walm"" becomes ""green green green.""

Examining the fourth example:

- ""zup lug walm"" outputs to ""yellow blue blue blue"". Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" resulting in ""blue blue blue"".

In the last example:

- ""zup dax walm"" translates to ""yellow green green green,"" where ""walm"" follows ""dax"" corresponding to ""green"" and results in ""green green green."" However, it's followed by ""zup wif,"" which gives us ""yellow red,"" showing that ""walm"" does not affect the words that come after it.

Based on this analysis, we can conclude that:

walm -> The meaning of ""walm"" results in the translation of the color word immediately before it being repeated three times.

Rule: If 'x' is the color word before ""walm,"" then ""walm"" translates to ""x x x.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm
    ",Output: green green green,green green green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be a straightforward word substitution where the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, dax seems to correspond directly to the color green in the output, irrespective of its position in the input. The rule appears to be straightforward without any context dependency.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, wif consistently translates to the color red.

Rule: Whenever the nonce word wif appears in the input, it should be replaced with the word red in the output.
zup -> yellow. Rule: The term ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule:
- wif = red
- lug = blue
- zup = yellow
- dax = green

When bluf follows a color word, it repeats the last color mentioned.

Examples:
- dax bluf -> green green (dax is green, bluf repeats that color)
- lug bluf -> blue blue (lug is blue, bluf repeats that color)
  
If bluf does not follow another color word, the output is not provided in the given examples. Thus, this deduction is based on the available data.

bluf -> repeat the last color mentioned.
Observing the given examples:

Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
Output: blue green yellow green green green red

Input: lug walm zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow red

Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

We notice that when ""walm"" is introduced into the sequence, every subsequent color outputted matches the color output of the word immediately preceding ""walm"". It continues until the sequence ends or a new word that can break the pattern appears.

Based on the evidence, here is the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> Replicate the color output of the word directly preceding ""walm"" for the rest of the sequence, or until a word that outputs 'red' appears (since 'red' seems to break the sequence).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow blue,yellow yellow blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue in each given example.
Based on the provided examples, we can infer that each unique word maps to a unique color, and that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""dax"" comes after ""wif"" and it's output as ""green"" while other words map to different colors.
- In the second example, ""dax"" is the second word and still maps to the color ""green.""
- In the third example, despite the words around ""dax"" changing, it still outputs ""green.""
- The fourth example is similar to the first; ""dax"" is at the end and the color it maps to is ""green.""
- The final example isolates ""dax"" by itself, and it still outputs ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green. Every time the word ""dax"" appears, regardless of position or surrounding words, it translates to the color green.
Given the examples, it seems that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" To construct a rule, we need a consistent pattern that can be applied to all examples. Observing each instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the same position in the output.

Let's break down each example to confirm the correlation:

- Input: wif walm dax zup / Output: red red red green yellow
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

- Input: dax bluf wif zup dax / Output: green green red yellow green
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
  
- Input: wif bluf lug / Output: red red blue
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
  
- Input: zup walm wif / Output: yellow yellow yellow red
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
  
- Input: wif dax / Output: red green
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

The rule that can be constructed from these examples is as follows:

Rule: wif -> red

This means that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: Each instance of the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" It does not seem to depend on context, as each time ""zup"" is mentioned, it translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it.
Rule: bluf -> repeats the color word that comes after it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the outputs whenever the word ""walm"" is found in the inputs:

1. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

3. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

5. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

Looking at the examples, the word immediately following ""walm"" (when it exists) doesn't seem to influence the color output associated with ""walm."" Instead, ""walm"" appears to always result in the output being the same color as the one immediately preceding ""walm"":

1. ""dax walm"" results in green green - the green from ""dax"" is repeated.
2. In ""zup dax lug walm zup,"" the blue from ""lug"" is repeated - blue blue.
3. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" results in yellow repeated - yellow yellow.

Based on this pattern, it can be induced that ""walm"" means ""repeat the color of the previous word.""

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug walm dax
    ",Output: red blue blue green,red blue blue blue green,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, here is the deduced meaning of ""lug"":

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue

Input: lug dax wif
Output: blue green red

Input: lug walm zup lug walm
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue

Input: zup lug dax lug
Output: yellow blue green blue

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green

Observations:
- Every time the word ""lug"" appears in an input, ""blue"" appears in the corresponding output.
- ""Lug"" does not seem to depend on the position within the sequence to be translated to ""blue.""
- Other words correlate with different colors (e.g., ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" and ""walm"" when not following ""lug"" appears to correlate with ""blue"" as well).

Rule: lug -> blue. Meaning that regardless of the context in the examples given, the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

Input: dax
Output: green

Here, the input ""dax"" corresponds directly to the output ""green.""

Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
Output: red yellow yellow red green

In this sequence, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green.""

Input: dax walm zup lug walm
Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" corresponds to both ""green"" and ""blue"" (repeated thrice), ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to a single instance of ""blue"".

Input: zup bluf dax
Output: yellow yellow green

Like before, ""zup"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Input: dax wif
Output: green red

""Dax"" again corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

With all examples considered, the rule appears to be that the word ""dax"" invariably corresponds to the color ""green,"" irrespective of the position in the sequence or surrounding words.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" appears to be associated with the color red. You can tell because every time the word ""wif"" appears, ""red"" is included in the output sequence at the corresponding position.

Here is a breakdown of what we can deduce from the inputs and outputs:

- ""bluf"" is consistently followed by ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" is associated with the color ""blue.""
- ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green.""

With these associations in mind, looking at ""wif,"" it always corresponds to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words. Therefore:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce a pattern for the word ""bluf"" and its corresponding output. Here is the analysis:

1. Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
2. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup -> Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
3. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
4. Input: lug bluf -> Output: blue blue
5. Input: wif bluf lug zup -> Output: red red blue yellow

In each of these examples, the output for ""bluf"" is the same color as the word that precedes it:

- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""yellow yellow"". ""Zup"" outputs ""yellow"".
- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""blue blue"". ""Lug"" outputs ""blue"".
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""red red"". ""Wif"" outputs ""red"".

Therefore, we can infer the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" is that it outputs the same color as the word immediately before it:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the output color of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we will first identify the patterns associated with each known word and their corresponding colors:

Known word-color associations:
dax -> green
lug -> blue
wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Now, let's analyze the instances of ""walm"" one by one, comparing them with the known word-color associations:

1. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   (""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the color blue is repeated three times)

2. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
   (""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the color yellow is repeated)

3. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   (""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the color yellow is repeated again)

4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   (""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the color green is repeated)

5. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   (""walm"" follows ""lug,"" leading to a repetition of blue; ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" leading to a repetition of yellow)

From these observations, we can see a pattern: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to repeat one or more times. This pattern is consistent across all examples:

Rule: walm -> Causes the color corresponding to the previous word to repeat.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax
    ",Output: yellow green,yellow green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
Based on the provided examples, we can discern a pattern correlating the word ""dax"" with a specific color in the output.

Input: dax lug dax wif dax
Output: green blue green red green

Here, every instance of ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output, no matter the position or the words around it.

Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow

In this case, ""dax"" still corresponds to the word ""green"". The words ""zup"" and ""bluf"" seem to relate to ""yellow"" and ""blue"" respectively, regardless of their position surrounding ""dax"".

The rest of the examples further support this pattern:

Input: zup dax
Output: yellow green

Input: zup bluf dax
Output: yellow yellow green

Input: dax wif
Output: green red

None of the contexts change the meaning of ""dax""; it always corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs provided.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
bluf -> repeats the color indicated by the word before it.

Rule: When you see ""bluf"" in the input, replace ""bluf"" with the color name that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it in the output.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the consistent patterns in the examples provided:

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is always yellow.
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is blue.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is green.
- ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it.

From this, we can infer the following rule about ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the input sequence.

For example, if ""zup"" (which corresponds to yellow) comes before ""walm,"" then ""walm"" will also correspond to yellow. If ""dax"" (which corresponds to green) comes before ""walm,"" then ""walm"" will also correspond to green, and so on.

Therefore: walm -> takes on the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning: blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
Based on the provided examples, we can induce that the presence of the word ""dax"" consistently results in the output of the color ""green."" Regardless of the other words (""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""bluf"") and their corresponding colors, whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output. It seems that ""dax"" is not influenced by the context or position within the sequence. Therefore, we can deduce:

dax -> green

Rule: When ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green.""
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs of each example provided.

1. Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif
   Output: red red yellow yellow red
   - ""wif"" appears at the beginning and the end and corresponds to ""red.""

2. Input: zup wif lug
   Output: yellow red blue
   - ""wif"" appears after ""zup"" and is represented by ""red.""

3. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red
   - ""wif"" again follows ""zup"" and is still ""red.""

4. Input: wif dax wif lug wif
   Output: red green red blue red
   - ""wif"" appears three times and each occurrence corresponds to ""red."" 
   
5. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" appears once at the start and is represented by ""red.""

Based on these comparisons, it appears that ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red,"" regardless of its position or the context. Therefore, the rule we can induce is:

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Supporting evidence from the examples:

1. Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
   - 'wif' corresponds to 'red,' so 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow.'

2. Input: lug zup lug -> Output: blue yellow blue
   - 'lug' corresponds to 'blue' at both ends, so the different word 'zup' in the middle corresponds to the different color 'yellow' in the middle.

3. Input: dax bluf wif lug zup -> Output: green green red blue yellow
   - 'dax' corresponds to 'green,' 'bluf' to another 'green,' 'wif' to 'red,' and 'lug' to 'blue.' The new word 'zup' at the end corresponds to the new color 'yellow' at the end.

4. Input: zup lug -> Output: yellow blue
   - In every instance, 'lug' corresponds to 'blue,' so in this pairing, 'zup' must correspond to 'yellow.'
   
5. Input: dax zup lug zup bluf -> Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow
   - The word 'dax' corresponds to 'green,' 'lug' to 'blue,' 'bluf' to 'yellow,' and where 'zup' appears, it consistently corresponds to 'yellow.' When it appears twice, it is 'yellow' each time, confirming that 'zup' means 'yellow.'
bluf -> meaning. The meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be a rule where it mirrors the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: If a color-associated word precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is the color corresponding to that preceding word.
- ""zup"" is associated with yellow, so ""bluf"" following ""zup"" results in ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" is associated with red, so ""bluf"" following ""wif"" results in ""red.""
- ""lug"" is associated with blue, so ""bluf"" following ""lug"" results in ""blue.""
Observing the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" consistently results in three instances of the same color, irrespective of its position in the sequence or the words around it. When ""walm"" is included:

- ""dax walm zup"" results in green green green yellow,
- ""dax walm"" results in green green green,
- ""zup walm"" results in yellow yellow yellow,

These combinations show that the presence of ""dax"" yields green, and ""zup"" yields yellow, both individually and when combined with ""walm."" ""Walm"" appears to act as a duplicator or amplifier of the color associated with the preceding word.

- ""wif walm dax zup"" results in red red red green yellow, which shows that ""wif"" yields red and ""walm"" amplifies the red.
- ""zup wif walm"" results in yellow red red red, where the word ""walm"" comes after both ""zup"" and ""wif,"" repeating the color of the word that immediately precedes it (in this case, ""wif"" -> red).

From these observations, it is possible to conclude that ""walm"" repeats or amplifies the color associated with the word right before it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

dax -> green

Rule: The non-standard English word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, every instance where the nonce word ""wif"" is used corresponds to a consistent output of ""red."" Therefore, the rule appears straightforward:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" each time it appears. Therefore:

zup -> yellow. Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the context within the given inputs.
Based on the given examples, bluf seems to be indicative of the previous word repeating in terms of the output color. For each instance, the color before bluf is repeated after bluf.

Here's the pattern:

(Input: ""dax zup lug zup"" translated to Output: ""green yellow blue yellow"" and after the word ""bluf"", ""yellow"" is repeated.)

Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
(Input: ""wif"" translated to Output: ""red"" and after the word ""bluf"", ""red"" is repeated.)

Rule: bluf -> indicates that the color associated with the preceding word will be repeated.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" is a nonce word that causes the associated color word to be repeated three times. Each occurrence of ""walm"" follows a color-associated word, and the output is the color word repeated thrice. To put it clearly:

- In the first example, ""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green,"" and when ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" repeated three times.
- ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and when followed by ""walm,"" it results in ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and when followed by ""walm,"" it results in ""blue"" repeated three times.
- It's important to note that ""walm"" does not seem to affect the other words like ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and there is no repetition following it. 

Therefore, the rule can be stated as: 

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color-associated word, it causes the output to be that color repeated three times. 

walm -> Repeat the preceding color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug wif zup bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""lug"" consistently results in the output ""blue."" Each instance of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output, irrespective of its position or surrounding words. Therefore, we can deduce:

Rule: lug -> blue
Dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in every example given.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" 

Here's the breakdown of the translation in each provided example:

Input: zup wif lug wif
Output: yellow red blue red
Observation: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Input: zup wif lug zup walm
Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
Observation: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" followed by ""wif"" which results in ""red."" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" followed by ""zup"" which is repeated three times, translating to ""yellow"" repeated three times for ""walm.""

Input: lug wif
Output: blue red
Observation: ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and is followed by ""wif,"" which translates to ""red.""

Input: wif dax
Output: red green
Observation: ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow
Observation: ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
From the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule underlying the nonce word ""bluf"" by comparing the inputs and the corresponding outputs and identifying the pattern.

Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
- ""zup"" maps to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" maps to ""red""
- ""dax"" maps to ""green""

Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
- ""dax"" maps to ""green""
- ""lug"" maps to ""blue""
- ""walm"" doesn't appear in other examples but maps to ""blue"" here
- ""wif"" maps to ""red""

Input: lug wif lug bluf
Output: blue red blue blue
- ""lug"" maps to ""blue""
- ""wif"" maps to ""red""

Input: wif lug bluf wif zup
Output: red blue blue red yellow
- ""wif"" maps to ""red""
- ""lug"" maps to ""blue""
- ""zup"" maps to ""yellow""

Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
- ""zup"" maps to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" maps to ""blue""
- ""wif"" maps to ""red""

It appears that ""bluf"" consistently maps to the color ""blue."" However, when ""bluf"" is present in the input, the following word's color is not what is expected (e.g., ""bluf wif"" results in ""blue red"" rather than ""blue red"" and ""bluf dax"" results in ""blue red"" instead of ""blue green""). It seems that ""bluf"" changes the color that follows it in the sequence to ""blue.""

Since ""bluf"" is a nonce word, it likely doesn't have a translation to a real-world object or concept and instead functions according to some rule within this specific context. Considering ""bluf"" precedes a color change to blue in the next word where otherwise a different color would have been expected, we can deduce a possible rule:

Rule: bluf causes the next word to map to the color ""blue,"" regardless of the word's usual corresponding color.

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: ""bluf"" turns the next color in the sequence to ""blue.""
Based on the examples provided, walm appears to be a function that takes the immediately preceding word and repeats its corresponding color three times. We can deduce this from the fact that ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" and ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"". The rule seems to be consistent regardless of other words that follow after ""walm"" in the sequence.

The correlation is as follows:

- ""dax"" correlates to the color green, and when followed by ""walm,"" the output is three instances of ""green.""
- ""lug"" correlates to the color blue, and when followed by ""walm,"" the output is three instances of ""blue.""

Therefore:

Rule: walm -> When ""walm"" follows a word, output the color corresponding to that word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup
    ",Output: red yellow,red yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue regardless of context.
Based on the provided examples, we can try to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax."" Here are the examples and their outputs again:

1. Input: zup dax bluf zup dax  
   Output: yellow green green yellow green
   
2. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf  
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   
3. Input: dax  
   Output: green
   
4. Input: dax zup bluf  
   Output: green yellow yellow
   
5. Input: dax  
   Output: green

From these examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" results in the output ""green,"" independent of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words. Therefore, we can deduce that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
Given the context of the examples provided, we can infer a pattern for the word ""wif"" in relation to the other words and their respective colors.

Let's analyze the examples:

1. ""wif dax bluf"" becomes ""red green green."" When ""wif"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output starts with ""red green.""
2. ""wif zup"" becomes ""red yellow."" ""Wif"" here is followed by ""zup,"" and the output is ""red yellow.""
3. ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" becomes ""red red green yellow red blue blue blue."" Whenever ""wif"" appears, the next color in the sequence is ""red.""
4. ""dax wif lug"" becomes ""green red blue."" ""Wif"" appears after ""dax"" and produces ""red.""
5. ""wif"" appears on its own and the output is ""red.""

From these examples, it can be deduced that irrespective of the words that come before or after, when ""wif"" appears, the color ""red"" is outputted. This is consistent in all examples, indicating that the presence of ""wif"" dictates the output ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow. Rule: The term ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in every example provided.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs to see the pattern.

Looking at the examples:

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

Here, ""wif"" correlates with the first ""red"", so it's logical to say that ""bluf"" also translates to ""red.""

Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow

In this sequence, we already know ""wif"" is ""red"" based on the first example. We can infer that ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" Again, ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""

Input: wif zup dax bluf
Output: red yellow green green

Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""dax"" seems to introduce ""green."" ""Bluf"" is paired with ""green"" in this case. This is an anomaly compared to the first example, so we must keep looking for patterns.

Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue

""Zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue."" Since ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" here and it's preceded by ""zup"" which is also ""yellow,"" we might infer that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word preceding it.

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

Again, ""bluf"" directly follows ""zup"" and takes on the same color, ""yellow"". The sequence after ""bluf,"" ""lug,"" does not align with the previous color; instead, it repeats the color of ""lug"" which is ""blue.""

Given these examples, the pattern for ""bluf"" does not appear to be tied to a single color or word. Instead, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.
From the given examples, we can infer that ""walm"" corresponds to repetitions of the color associated with the word preceding it. To establish the rule, let's analyze each example:

1. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Here, ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"" and ""walm"" results in the color ""blue"" being repeated three times.

2. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   Here, ""wif"" is associated with ""red"" and ""walm"" results in the color ""red"" being repeated three times, followed by ""green"" which is associated with ""dax"".

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Here, ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" and ""walm"" results in ""green"" being repeated three times.

4. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red
   In this case, ""dax"" is before ""walm"" and is associated with ""green"". ""Walm"" again results in ""green"" being repeated three times. ""Zup"" is associated with ""yellow"" and ""wif"" is associated with ""red"".

5. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow
   Again, ""wif"" is associated with ""red"" and ""walm"" results in ""red"" being repeated three times, followed by ""yellow"" which is associated with ""zup"".

Based on these observations, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup dax
    ",Output: green yellow green,green yellow green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, each example that includes the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the output. Therefore, the rule appears to be directly related to translating ""lug"" to ""blue"" whenever it appears.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, we can derive the rule:

dax -> green

This is evidenced by the fact that each time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding output. The rule seems to hold regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence. Additionally, other words seem to have a consistent translation to specific colors in the outputs as well.

Rule:
dax consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the output.
Rule: wif -> red.
From examining the provided examples, one can deduce that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red."" However, upon closer inspection, it seems that when ""bluf"" is present in the input, it generates ""red"" followed by the color that ""lug"" corresponds to, which is ""blue.""

To break down the pattern:

- In the first example, the presence of ""bluf"" results in ""red red,"" and ""lug"" results in ""blue.""
- In the second example, there is no ""lug,"" but ""bluf"" still results in ""red red.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" appears before ""lug,"" which leads to ""red red"" followed by ""lug"" generating ""blue,"" and then the rest of the sequence follows the color pattern of the words presented - ""zup"" leading to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" which results in ""green red,"" showing that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and when ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" it generates ""green,"" a deviation from the previous pattern.
- The fifth example is similar to the first and third, with ""bluf"" resulting in ""red red"" and ""lug"" resulting in ""blue.""

It becomes clear from these examples that ""bluf"" consistently generates an extra ""red"" in its output.

Rule: bluf -> generates the color ""red"" followed by the color corresponding to the next word in sequence if there is one, or just ""red"" if there is no next word or the next word is ""wif."" In this case, when it precedes ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue""), it generates ""red blue.""
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the contexts in which it appears and the corresponding outputs. Let's examine each example and identify patterns.

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - Here, walm follows dax and both produce ""green."" Since ""dax"" appears alone and in combination with ""walm"" while always yielding ""green,"" it's hard to isolate walm's meaning in this example.

2. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
   - The sequence ""dax walm"" again yields ""green green green,"" but we have extra words, ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""zup,"" that correspond to ""blue,"" ""red,"" and ""yellow,"" respectively.

3. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and the sequence ""walm dax"" gives us ""blue blue green."" Given that ""dax"" alone corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" seems to have a relationship with the word that precedes it.

4. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   - Consistent with earlier observations, ""lug"" links to ""blue,"" but after ""walm,"" it leads to a repetition of ""blue."" 

5. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green
   - ""lug"" links to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" The presence of ""walm"" after ""dax"" doesn't change ""dax""'s corresponding output of ""green.""

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" makes the following word's corresponding output repeat as many times as the word ""walm"" appears. In the examples given, ""walm"" occurs only once and therefore the color corresponding to the word following ""walm"" repeats once (making a total of two instances of the color). There is no instance of ""walm"" appearing more than once to further support this rule, but based on the available data, this is the most plausible pattern.

Rule: walm -> causes the output corresponding to the next word in the input to be repeated once.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm zup
    ",Output: blue blue yellow,blue blue blue yellow,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue 

Rule: In the given examples, every time the word ""lug"" appears, the output consistently includes the color ""blue."" Based on this consistent mapping, it can be deduced that the word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we'll look for patterns that correspond with its appearance in both the input and the output. 

Here is what we observe:

1. Whenever the word ""dax"" is given in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output.
   
   - Input: dax wif zup -> Output: green red yellow
   - Input: lug zup dax lug dax -> Output: blue yellow green blue green
   - Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf -> Output: yellow green yellow green red red
   - Input: wif dax lug dax -> Output: red green blue green
   - Input: lug zup dax wif zup -> Output: blue yellow green red yellow

2. The appearance of ""dax"" does not seem to be position-dependent; it is always translated to ""green"" no matter where it appears in the sequence.

Based on these observations, the rule seems straightforward:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds to a specific color. It is consistently mapped to the color mentioned directly after it. Here's the pattern based on each input:

1. Input: zup wif lug zup walm -> Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the corresponding color is ""red.""

2. Input: dax lug dax wif dax -> Output: green blue green red green
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""dax,"" and the corresponding color is ""red.""

3. Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
   - ""wif"" is followed by the end of the sequence, and the corresponding color is ""red.""

4. Input: wif dax wif -> Output: red green red
   - The first ""wif"" stands alone and is followed by ""dax,"" and the corresponding color is ""red.""
   - The second ""wif"" follows ""dax"" and the corresponding color is again ""red.""

5. Input: wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" and the corresponding color is ""red.""

In each case, independent of what follows ""wif,"" the output color for this word is ""red."" Hence, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

The consistent element in all given examples is that whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output. Regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
bluf -> repeated color of the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes the color associated with the preceding word and repeats it once for the ""bluf"" word itself.
Based on the provided examples, we can notice that the word ""walm"" consistently corresponds to three ""yellow"" words in the output. The presence of other words (""dax"", ""zup"", ""wif"") leads to different colors, but ""walm"" alone always results in three yellows. 

Therefore, the rule appears to be:
walm -> three yellows

Rule: Whenever ""walm"" is present in the input, the output will include three consecutive instances of the word ""yellow.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" Here’s the rule induction based on each input-output pair:

1. Input: lug
   Output: blue
   Rule: ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

2. Input: lug
   Output: blue
   Rule: ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" (Consistent with the first example)

3. Input: zup wif lug wif
   Output: yellow red blue red
   Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" The words appear to retain their individual color translations independently of order.

4. Input: lug zup dax wif
   Output: blue yellow green red
   Rule: ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red."" The color translation for ""lug"" remains the same.

5. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red
   Rule: ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""walm"" also translates to ""blue,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" could potentially be a combination of ""blue"" and ""red,"" although we are not given a direct translation, it results in two colors at the end (""blue"" and ""red""), perhaps implying a repetition of the preceding colors.

Based on these observations:

lug -> meaning. Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""
Based on the Input/Output provided in the examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or the rule that applies to the nonce word ""dax."" To do this, we need to see how ""dax"" affects the sequence of colors in the output and what its presence correlates with in each example.

Input: lug wif dax -> Output: blue red green
Input: wif bluf lug dax wif -> Output: red red blue green red
Input: lug wif lug dax bluf -> Output: blue red blue green green
Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf -> Output: blue red red green blue blue
Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue

Observations:
- In every output where the word ""dax"" is present in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding output.

""Dax"" is consistently followed by or associated with ""green"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence. In examples where ""dax"" is between other words, the words before and after ""dax"" still correspond to their respective colors, suggesting that ""dax"" does not alter the output of neighboring words.

Based on the observations, the rule for ""dax"" seems to be:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif"" from the given examples, let's analyze the input-output patterns:

Input: wif lug dax
Output: red blue green
- Here, ""wif"" precedes ""lug"" and is followed by ""dax,"" resulting in ""red"" before ""blue"" and followed by ""green.""

Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
- ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and since ""wif"" follows it and the pattern changes to ""red,"" ""wif"" might be ""red."" The second ""lug"" yields ""blue"" again. ""Wif"" at the end of the sequence again translates to ""red,"" supporting the initial observation.

Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
Output: red yellow yellow red green
- ""Wif"" at both the beginning and in the middle of the sequence corresponds to ""red."" ""Zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" at the end to ""green.""

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red
- ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" here is followed by ""bluf"" but yields ""red"" before a sequence of ""red,"" indicating that it is not dependent on the following word for its meaning.

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red
- Once again, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" reinforcing the pattern.

Based on the above examples, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red"" regardless of its position or the surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> ""yellow"" 

It translates directly to the color yellow regardless of its placement within the sequence.
bluf -> red
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we will look for patterns relating to its usage in the input and its corresponding color in the output. Let’s analyze each input-output pair.

1. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   - The word ""walm"" here corresponds to the color blue.

2. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - The word ""walm"" here corresponds to the color yellow.

3. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   - The word ""walm"" here is represented by the color blue after the sequence ""wif zup bluf lug.""

4. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   - The word ""walm"" results in the color red repeated, but there is no change from the previous word, which is ""wif.""

Based on these examples, ""walm"" does not correspond to a fixed color directly, but its presence in the example sequences seems to result in the repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm"". If we see the input ""wif walm,"" since ""wif"" translates to red, ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color red.

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color to be repeated.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided:

lug bluf -> blue blue
lug -> blue
zup lug -> yellow blue
lug -> blue
lug wif -> blue red

It appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" regardless of its position or the context within the input phrase.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position within the input sequence or the presence of other words. Thus, it appears that ""dax"" is directly representative of the color green.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following rule:

- Whenever the input contains the word ""wif"" by itself, the output is ""red.""
- When the input contains ""wif lug,"" the output is ""red blue.""
- When the input contains ""dax wif lug,"" the output adds ""green"" in front of the ""red blue"" sequence.

Therefore, ""wif"" consistently correlates with the output ""red."" However, we can also observe that the presence of additional words alongside ""wif"" changes the output sequence or adds to it. In the case of ""lug"" following ""wif,"" ""blue"" is added to the output. When ""dax"" precedes ""wif lug,"" ""green"" is added to the beginning of the output sequence.

Based on these observations, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: ""wif"" correlates with the output color ""red."" The presence of additional words modifies the output sequence, with ""lug"" adding ""blue"" and ""dax"" preceding ""wif lug"" adding ""green"" to the start of the output sequence.

Based on the examples provided, zup appears to correspond to the color yellow each time it is used. Regardless of its position in the sequence of words, the output associated with zup is consistently yellow. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the outputs provided.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that is repeated in the sequence. When the input is ""lug bluf wif"", the output is ""blue blue red,"" which indicates that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that came before it, ""blue."" Each time ""bluf"" appears, it takes the color of the word immediately preceding it. 

Therefore, the induction for ""bluf"" is as follows:

bluf -> The same color as the word before it.

Rule: If a color word is followed by ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" outputs the same color as that word.
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word three times. 

In every example, the word immediately before walm corresponds to a color (zup -> yellow, lug -> blue, dax -> green, wif -> red). The output then repeats the name of this color three times. Hence, ""walm"" results in the triplet repetition of the color mentioned before it.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples, we can attempt to extract the rule for the nonce word ""wif."" The word ""wif"" seems to correspond to a specific color in the output, but it's influenced by the word that comes before it. Looking at the patterns:

1. When ""wif"" appears after ""lug,"" the output is blue followed by red.
2. When ""wif"" is by itself, the output is red.
3. When ""wif"" appears after ""walm,"" the output is three reds.
4. When ""wif"" is after ""dax,"" the output is two reds.

However, there is an inconsistency:

- In the second example, ""wif"" follows ""zup"" and the output is a singular red.
- In the last example, ""wif"" also follows ""zup,"" but the output is red followed by green.

It appears that the inconsistency may arise from the position of ""wif"" in the sequence or possibly the words that follow ""wif."" Since ""wif"" always results in at least one red in the output, it's reasonable to deduce that one element of ""wif"" translates to red.

Without a pattern that precisely explains when ""wif"" results in a single red and when it results in multiple colors or additional reds, the safest conclusion from the given data is:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the output, with additional colors possibly being determined by the previous word in the input sequence and the position within the sequence. Further examples would be needed to fully uncover any additional rules pertaining to ""wif.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" is consistently translated as ""yellow"" in each example provided.
bluf -> blue

Rule: In the given examples, each instance of the word ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the color blue in the output.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the non-word ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it three times.

Here is the analysis:

- In the first example, ""lug walm wif"" correlates to ""blue blue blue red,"" where ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" with ""dax"" being ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats it three times.
- In the third example, ""dax walm wif walm"" produces ""green green green red red red,"" confirming the previous pattern.
- In the fourth example, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and we get ""yellow yellow yellow,"" so ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup"" three times.
- The fifth example, ""dax walm zup lug dax,"" further confirms the pattern as ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and repeats ""green"" three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: When following a color term, ""walm"" causes that color to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup dax zup
    ",Output: red yellow green yellow,red yellow green yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Every instance of the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
Observing the given examples, let's attempt to deduce the meaning of ""wif"":

1. Example 1:
   Input: zup wif lug
   Output: yellow red blue

2. Example 2:
   Input: wif dax
   Output: red green

3. Example 3:
   Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow red green red red

4. Example 4:
   Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

5. Example 5:
   Input: zup wif dax
   Output: yellow red green

In these examples, each time the word ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red"" followed by the color that corresponds to the word immediately after ""wif"". Therefore, it seems that ""wif"" can be interpreted as ""red followed by the color that corresponds to the next word"".

For instance, in Example 1, ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue"". In Example 2, ""wif dax"" translates to ""red green"". This pattern holds true for the other examples as well.

Based on this analysis, the rule for ""wif"" is:

Rule: wif -> ""red followed by the color that corresponds to the next word in the input sequence"".
To determine the rule for the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze the examples provided and inspect how the presence of ""zup"" correlates with the changes in the output.

1. Input: zup bluf dax
   Output: yellow yellow green
   - ""bluf"" maps to yellow and ""dax"" maps to green.

2. Input: zup dax
   Output: yellow green
   - When ""zup"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output is yellow followed by green.

3. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green
   - When ""zup"" is between ""dax,"" it causes the output yellow. ""walm"" generates triple green according to this example since it follows a ""dax.""

4. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow
   - ""wif"" gives red and is followed by the yellow associated with ""zup.""

5. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
   - ""zup"" gives yellow, and ""wif"" generates red. The second red seems to follow from ""bluf,"" but ""bluf"" gave yellow in example 1. This discrepancy could indicate that the color mapping for ""bluf"" might depend on its position relative to ""zup"" or that there's an interaction with preceding words.

Let's review the occurrences where ""zup"" is present:

- It always results in a yellow in the output sequence, regardless of its position.
- The presence of ""zup"" does not change the mapping of ""dax,"" as it remains green in all cases.

Based on this analysis, the straightforward rule that emerges is that ""zup"" maps to yellow, regardless of its position or neighboring words. However, due to the change in the color mapping for ""bluf"" in the presence of ""zup,"" it is possible there are more complex interaction rules that have not been disclosed with the given data. The examples do not provide enough variations to conclusively determine if ""zup"" affects other words or not.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" correlates with the color ""red."" Every time the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. 

Therefore, the rule is:

bluf -> red.
To determine the meaning of the word ""walm,"" one must analyze the patterns in which the word appears and the corresponding outputs. Here is a look at the examples provided:

1. wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
    - Output: red red green green red red red blue red

2. dax walm lug
    - Output: green green green blue

3. dax walm
    - Output: green green green

4. zup walm wif
    - Output: yellow yellow yellow red

5. zup lug walm
    - Output: yellow blue blue blue
 
Analyzing the examples:

- In the first and second examples, the appearance of ""walm"" results in a blue output immediately followed by the output corresponding to ""lug"" (blue).
- In the third example, ""walm"" does not have anything following it but has a triple repetition of ""green,"" which correlates with ""dax.""
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which correlates with ""yellow."" ""Walm"" leads to another ""yellow"" followed by the output corresponding to the next word (""wif"" -> red, ""lug"" -> blue).

Given these observations, it seems that ""walm"" may be a rule indicating that the next color output should be repeated. More specifically, when ""walm"" is followed by another nonce word, the color corresponding to that nonce word should be repeated once. If ""walm"" is at the end, it seems to repeat the previous color output another time. Here is the rule based on the analysis:

The Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the next word. If there is no next word, repeat the color of the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif bluf
    ",Output: green red red,green red red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To determine the meaning of ""lug,"" we need to look at the context in which it appears and the corresponding outputs.

1. lug wif walm -> blue red red red
2. zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red
3. zup lug -> yellow blue
4. dax zup lug zup bluf -> green yellow blue yellow yellow
5. lug bluf -> blue blue

Analyzing the examples:

- In the first and third examples, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" is immediately followed by ""wif,"" and the output is ""blue red,"" mirroring the first example where ""lug wif"" also outputs ""blue red.""
- The fourth example is consistent with the others, with ""lug"" translating to ""blue"" in the sequence.
- The fifth example is simply ""lug bluf,"" which outputs ""blue blue,"" supporting the hypothesis that ""lug"" means ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the meaning of the word ""wif"" can be deduced as follows:

- Every single instance of ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
- In the last example, ""walm"" and ""dax"" are both followed by ""red,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Thus, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" is:

Rule: wif -> red
From the examples provided, we can deduce the following color associations for each word:

- 'zup' consistently translates to 'yellow'.
- 'wif' translates to 'red'.
- 'walm' also translates to 'yellow' when it is not preceded by 'zup', but 'yellow red' when preceded by 'zup'.
- 'lug' translates to 'blue'.
- 'dax' translates to 'green'.

In the given context, we can establish these mappings based on each word's consistent color output across different examples. However, since the word 'walm' gives different colors when preceded by 'zup', this suggests that 'zup' might be modifying the word following it under certain conditions.

Here is the rule as observed:

- 'zup' -> 'yellow'
- 'wif' -> 'red'
- 'walm' -> 'yellow', but when 'walm' directly follows 'zup', it becomes 'red'
- 'lug' -> 'blue'
- 'dax' -> 'green'

Rule: The word 'zup' represents the color 'yellow'. Other words represent different colors unless they directly follow 'zup', in which case they may change meaning depending on the specific combination. However, based on the limited examples, the only word that changes meaning is 'walm' which becomes 'red' instead of 'yellow'.
Rule: bluf -> blue.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the examples provided:

1. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue

2. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red

3. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

4. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

Analyzing the outputs corresponding to ""walm,"" we see that the word immediately preceding ""walm"" is repeated three times in the color sequence in the output. The patterns are:

1. ""wif walm lug"" converts to ""red red red blue""
2. ""dax walm wif"" converts to ""green green green red""
3. ""lug walm zup"" converts to ""blue blue blue yellow""
4. ""lug walm"" converts to ""blue blue blue""
5. ""wif walm dax"" converts to ""red red red green""

Based on this, it appears that ""walm"" indicates that the color corresponding to the word that comes before ""walm"" should be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> The word preceding ""walm"" is converted to its color and repeated three times in the output sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm
    ",Output: yellow red red red,yellow yellow yellow,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""lug"" correlates with the color ""blue."" However, there is an additional pattern within the outputs where ""lug"" is followed by additional instances of ""blue"" depending on certain conditions.

Analyzing the examples:

- Example 1: Input ""lug"" yields a singular ""blue.""
- Example 2: Input ""lug"" is at the end of the sequence and it yields a singular ""blue.""
- Example 3: Input ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" which seems to duplicate the output color ""blue"" twice, as ""walm"" also resulted in further instances of the color ""blue.""
- Example 4: Input ""lug"" again is followed by ""walm,"" duplicating the ""blue"" color.
- Example 5: Input ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" which again results in the ""blue"" color being produced three times.

From this, we can deduce that:

- ""lug"" itself corresponds to ""blue"" when it appears alone or is at the end of a sequence.
- ""lug"" followed by ""walm"" multiplies the instances of ""blue"" in the output.

Thus, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue,"" with repetitions of ""blue"" depending on the subsequent occurrence of the word ""walm"" after ""lug."" Specifically, for each ""walm"" that immediately follows ""lug,"" one additional ""blue"" is added to the output.

lug -> meaning: blue, with repetition based on the presence and count of the word ""walm"" following it.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green."" To check this hypothesis, we can examine each instance where ""dax"" is used and its corresponding output:

- In ""zup dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the sequence ""yellow green green green.""
- In ""zup dax zup lug,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the sequence ""yellow green yellow blue.""
- In ""lug dax wif,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the sequence ""blue green red.""
- In ""wif dax zup walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the sequence ""red green yellow yellow yellow.""
- In ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" translates to ""green"" in the sequence ""green green.""

In all instances, the word ""dax"" correlates to the color ""green"" without exception. Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
From the given examples, the word ""wif"" consistently correlates with the color ""red"" in the output:

Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

Input: zup wif bluf zup
Output: yellow red red yellow

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: wif
Output: red

In each case, the presence of ""wif"" directly results in the appearance of ""red"" in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow.
Rule: bluf -> green
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" generates an output of repeated color words, with the specific color depending on the word that precedes ""walm"". The rule for the output generated appears to also depend on the number of times the preceding word occurs before ""walm"".

Let's analyze the examples:

1. Input: zup dax walm
   Output: yellow green green green
   Analysis: ""dax"" occurs once before ""walm"" and results in three ""green"" outputs.

2. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   Analysis: ""lug"" occurs once before ""walm"" and results in three ""blue"" outputs.

3. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   Analysis: ""zup"" occurs twice before ""walm"" and results in four ""yellow"" outputs. Since ""zup"" occurs immediately before ""walm"", this might suggest that the immediate predecessor determines the color output, with repetition increasing the count of the output.

4. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red
   Analysis: ""dax"" occurs twice before ""walm"" and results in four ""green"" outputs. 

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Analysis: ""dax"" occurs once before ""walm"" and results in three ""green"" outputs.

Considering the evidence, it appears that ""walm"" makes the next word in the output repeat the color associated with the word that occurs just before ""walm,"" and the number of repetitions corresponds to the total number of times that particular word has occurred in the sequence before ""walm"". For example, if ""lug"" occurs once before ""walm,"" the word ""blue"" will be repeated three times in the output. The exact counts (three for a single occurrence, four for a double occurrence) might be idiosyncratic to this generated language example.

Alongside this, ""walm"" itself always seems to translate to the color associated with the preceding word once, regardless of the number of times the preceding word has occurred.

Hence the rule seems to be: When the word ""walm"" follows a word, the output is the color associated with the preceding word, with the output color repeated for as many times the preceding word has occurred before ""walm"", plus one additional repetition for ""walm"" itself.

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the color word associated with the word immediately before ""walm"", according to the total past occurrences of that word in the sequence plus one.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue."" Regardless of its position in a sequence or the presence of other words, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue.""
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can observe the following patterns:

- Every instance of ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- Other words correspond to different colors, for instance, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""red red red.""

We can also notice that the word ""zup"" doesn't change in meaning regardless of its position in the sequence; it always translates to ""yellow.""

Considering these observations, the rule induction for the word ""zup"" is straightforward:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" consistently means ""yellow"" in the given context.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to analyze how it correlates with the colors in the outputs. Let's look at the instances of ""bluf"" in the inputs and their respective color in the outputs:

1. Input: dax bluf wif zup wif - Output: green green red yellow red
2. Input: dax lug wif bluf - Output: green blue red red
3. Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif - Output: blue green green yellow blue red
4. Input: zup lug bluf wif - Output: yellow blue blue red
5. Input: wif zup dax bluf - Output: red yellow green green

It can be observed that whenever ""bluf"" appears, the color ""green"" appears in the output at the same position. Additionally, none of the other nonce words (""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""zup"") consistently map to ""green"" across the given examples. Thus, based on the provided context, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> green
Based on the given examples, it looks like ""walm"" correlates with repeating the last color mentioned before ""walm"" as many times as the number of words that precede ""walm,"" including ""walm"" itself.

Let's review the examples:

1. Input: ""dax walm""
   Output: ""green green green""
   There is one word before ""walm"" (which is ""dax"" corresponding to ""green""), and ""walm"" leads to two more instances of ""green"" in the output.

2. Input: ""wif walm dax""
   Output: ""red red red green""
   There are two words before ""walm"" (""wif,"" which correlates to ""red"" and ""walm"" itself), resulting in ""red"" being repeated twice in the output, plus the color translation of ""dax"" which is ""green.""

3. Input: ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug""
   Output: ""blue blue red blue red red red blue""
   There are five words before ""walm"" and ""walm"" itself makes six, so ""red,"" the color that correlates with ""wif"" (the word before ""walm""), is repeated six times in total in the output. 

4. Input: ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm""
   Output: ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue""
   Here, ""walm"" appears twice. The first ""walm"" has one ""wif"" before it, making ""red"" repeat twice before the color corresponding to ""dax"" (""green""). The second ""walm"" has four words preceding it, so it has the last color, which is ""blue"" from ""lug,"" repeated three times.

5. Input: ""dax wif walm lug zup walm""
   Output: ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow""
   The first ""walm"" comes after two words (""dax"" and ""wif"") which results in ""red"" being repeated twice after the initial ""green."" The second ""walm"" has ""lug zup"" before it which translates to ""blue yellow,"" so ""walm"" has each of these colors repeat to match the total count, which is three.

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" as many times as there are words that include and precede ""walm"" in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of the context it appears in.

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> green
wif -> red
zup -> meaning. 

Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of the context or the presence of other words:

- When combined with ""wif"" or ""lug,"" zup produces an output that includes ""yellow"" with another color.
- When used with ""dax"" or by itself, zup's presence still results in ""yellow"" being part of the output.

Rule: The word ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the color ""blue."" Consequently, ""bluf"" consistently maps to the same color output across different examples, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> blue
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to correlate with a repetition of the color associated with the previous word. Here's the rule deduced from the examples:

- The first use of ""walm"" after any given word causes the color associated with that word to be repeated three times.
- If ""walm"" is used consecutively after a sequence including ""wif,"" the color red is repeated three times, regardless of what color was associated with ""wif.""

Let's break it down with each example:

1. ""dax walm wif walm zup""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" hence ""walm"" after ""dax"" yields ""green"" three times.
- ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" so ""walm"" after ""wif"" yields ""red"" three times.
- Finally, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

Output: green green green red red red yellow

2. ""zup walm""
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" following ""zup"" yields ""yellow"" three times.

Output: yellow yellow yellow

3. ""zup walm wif""
- ""zup"" followed by ""walm"" yields ""yellow"" three times.
- ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

Output: yellow yellow yellow red

4. ""wif walm dax zup""
- ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" yields ""red"" three times.
- ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

Output: red red red green yellow

5. ""zup lug walm wif walm""
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" introduces a new color which is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" following ""lug"" yields ""blue"" three times.
- ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" so ""walm"" after ""wif"" yields ""red"" three times.

Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red

Therefore, the rule appears to be:
Rule: walm -> Causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times. If used after ""wif,"" it repeats the color red three times regardless of the preceding color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every given example.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. When ""dax"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the combination results in ""blue green,"" with ""lug"" contributing ""blue"" and ""dax"" contributing ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, it is translated to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position or the context within the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look at the patterns in the given examples and the corresponding outputs. Here are the observations:

1. Whenever ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red"".
2. Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green"".
3. Whenever ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue"".

Since these patterns hold true consistently, we can deduce that ""wif"" correlates to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Now, let's analyze the occurrences of ""bluf"":

- In the first example, the presence of ""wif"" followed by ""bluf"" results in ""red red,"" which would imply that ""bluf"" also translates to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" appears after ""dax"" and ""lug"" and before ""wif,"" and the output is ""green green blue red."" Since we already know the colors that correspond to the other words, it seems ""bluf"" takes its output from the word that comes immediately before it.
- The third and fifth examples further support this, as ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" resulting in ""blue blue"" and after ""wif"" leading to ""red red.""

Based on these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" takes its meaning from the color associated with the word immediately preceding it in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" translates to the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the word 'walm' corresponds to the repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. It seems that each unique word (other than 'walm') is mapped to a specific color:

- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red

Now let's test the assumption with the given examples:

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red
- 'lug' gives blue.
- 'wif' gives red.
- 'walm' repeats the color of 'wif,' which is red, three times.

Input: dax walm

- 'dax' corresponds to green.
- 'walm' repeats the color of 'dax,' which is green, three times.

Input: zup walm dax lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
- 'zup' yields yellow.
- 'walm' repeats the color of 'zup,' which is yellow, three times.
- 'dax' yields green.
- 'lug' gives blue.

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
- 'dax' gives green.
- 'wif' yields red.
- 'zup' yields yellow.
- 'bluf' outputs yellow (assuming 'bluf' to have the same output as 'zup')
- 'wif' yields red.
- 'walm' repeats the color of 'wif,' which is red, three times.

Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
- 'wif' yields red.
- 'zup' gives yellow.
- 'walm' repeats the color of 'zup,' which is yellow, three times.
- 'dax' yields green.
- 'zup' gives yellow again.

With this analysis, the rule for 'walm' appears to be:

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the immediately preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in all given examples.
Based on the provided examples, the rules for the nonce word ""zup"" can be discerned as follows:

- Input contains ""zup dax"" -> Output: yellow green
- Input contains a standalone ""zup"" -> Output starts with yellow
- ""zup"" followed by a different word -> Output starts with yellow followed by other colors that map to each of those words.

Therefore:

zup -> yellow

Rule: When the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the output always starts with the color yellow. The subsequent colors depend on the other words that follow ""zup"" in the sequence.
Rule:

Analyzing the inputs and corresponding outputs, it seems like the rule for the word ""bluf"" is to repeat the color of the word that comes immediately after ""bluf"". Here's the breakdown:

Input: wif dax bluf -> Output: red green green
Here, ""bluf"" is followed by no word, but the color repeated is ""green"" which is the color for ""dax"".

Input: wif bluf zup -> Output: red red yellow
""bluf"" is followed by ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"".

Input: zup bluf wif dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow red green blue
""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"".

Input: dax zup bluf -> Output: green yellow yellow
""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"".

Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> Output: red red yellow red blue green
""bluf"" is followed by ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"".

Bluf -> meaning: Bluf indicates to repeat the color associated with the next word in the sequence. If there is no next word, the color to repeat is the one associated with the last word mentioned before ""bluf"".
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can look at the patterns and associations between the inputs and outputs. The key is to find a consistent relationship between the presence of ""walm"" and a particular color or sequence of colors in the output.

Here are the observations from the examples provided:

- In every example where ""walm"" is present, the output ends with a sequence of the same color.
- The number of colors in the sequence matches the number of times ""walm"" appears in the input.
- The color in the sequence seems to be determined by the word immediately preceding ""walm."" For instance:
  - When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output color is red.
  - When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output color is blue.
  - When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output color is green.

Given these patterns, we can discern the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" represents a command to output a sequence of the same color, with the color and number of repetitions determined by the word immediately before ""walm."" If ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the color is red; if it follows ""lug,"" the color is blue; if it's after ""dax,"" the color is green; and if it's after ""zup,"" the color is yellow. The number of repetitions of the color in the sequence is the same as the number of times ""walm"" appears.

Hence:
walm -> meaning: Repeat the color specified by the preceding word the number of times ""walm"" appears in the input.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the given examples. Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word 'dax' consistently translates to the color 'green' regardless of its position in the sequence. The presence of other nonce words ('zup,' 'bluf,' 'walm,' 'lug') correspond to the other colors such as 'yellow,' 'blue,' etc., but 'dax' always corresponds to 'green'.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the output ""yellow"" regardless of its position among other words. Even when paired with other words that translate to different colors, the word ""zup"" always results in ""yellow"". This suggests that ""zup"" does not modify or get modified by the context it's in; its meaning remains constant. Therefore, we can conclude the rule for ""zup"" is:

Rule: zup -> yellow. ""Zup"" means yellow.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that every instance of the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color word ""red"" in the output. Thus, the rule seems to be:

bluf -> ""red""

Rule: Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, it translates to ""red"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided:

1. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"" suggests that ""walm"" could mean a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it.

2. ""zup lug walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue"" supports this further, as ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the output is three ""blue"" which is the color associated with ""lug.""

3. ""lug walm dax"" -> ""blue blue blue green"" shows ""walm"" after ""lug"" again and results in three ""blue,"" followed by ""green"" which corresponds to ""dax.""

4. ""zup dax lug walm zup"" -> ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow"" also supports the rule. ""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is three ""blue"" which is the color for ""lug,"" with the colors for ""zup"" and ""dax"" correctly matching their places in the sequence.

5. ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green green green red"" again has ""walm"" after ""dax,"" followed by another color ""red"" which corresponds to ""wif.""

Rule: walm -> repeats the color associated with the previous word three times.

For example, the word before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" thus ""walm"" translates to ""green green green."" If the word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" then ""walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif bluf zup lug wif
    ",Output: red red yellow blue red,red red yellow blue red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue."" To confirm this, let's look at each instance where ""lug"" appears and the corresponding output:

1. ""wif dax wif lug wif"" - Output: red green red blue red
2. ""wif bluf dax lug"" - Output: red red green blue
3. ""dax lug"" - Output: green blue
4. ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" - Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
5. ""zup walm lug wif"" - Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red

In each example, the occurrence of ""lug"" directly corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the sequence or the context.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the word ""red."" There does not appear to be any context or conditionality to the use of ""wif"" that changes its output. Each time ""wif"" is mentioned, the output is ""red,"" regardless of its position within the sequence of nonce words.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" acts as a repeater or duplicator for the color represented by the word immediately preceding it.

Here's the deduction process:

Input: wif bluf zup
Output: red red yellow
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- The word ""bluf"" causes ""red"" to be repeated before moving on to ""yellow.""

Input: lug wif bluf lug wif
Output: blue red red blue red
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""
- ""bluf"" duplicates the color of the word before it (red in this case).

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" again duplicates ""red.""

Input: lug bluf dax lug
Output: blue blue green blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" duplicates ""blue.""

Input: zup bluf dax lug
Output: yellow yellow green blue
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" duplicates ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the previous word.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the output in each instance to see how they correlate with the input, focusing on where ""walm"" appears.

1. Input: ""zup walm"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
2. Input: ""zup walm dax lug"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow yellow green blue""
3. Input: ""wif dax lug walm"" -> Output: ""red green blue blue blue""
4. Input: ""dax walm"" -> Output: ""green green green""
5. Input: ""lug wif dax zup walm"" -> Output: ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow""

Looking at the outputs associated with ""walm"":

- When ""zup"" comes before ""walm"" the color ""yellow"" is repeated.
- When ""dax"" comes before ""walm"" the color ""green"" is repeated.
- ""Walm"" on its own corresponds to repeating the color before it.

It seems that ""walm"" causes the preceding color to be repeated three times. This is evident in cases where ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" (yielding ""yellow"" repeated) and when ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" (yielding ""green"" repeated), and even when ""walm"" is at the end, where the previous color is simply repeated.

Rule: ""walm"" causes the immediately preceding color to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax zup lug dax bluf
    ",Output: blue green yellow blue green green,blue green yellow blue green green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"". 

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the provided examples, we can observe the following:

```
Input: dax bluf wif zup          Output: green green red yellow
Input: lug zup dax wif           Output: blue yellow green red
Input: dax walm lug              Output: green green green blue
Input: dax lug                   Output: green blue
Input: dax lug wif bluf          Output: green blue red red
```

The word `dax` always correlates with the color `green` in the output. Regardless of its position in the input string or the surrounding words, the output color associated with `dax` is unchanged.

Rules:
- dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of 'wif', let's analyze each input and its corresponding output, looking for a pattern:

1. ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green yellow red green green""
2. ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue""
3. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
4. ""wif zup"" -> ""red yellow""
5. ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif"" -> ""blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red""

It appears that every time the word 'wif' is present, the 'red' color is produced in the output.

Now, let's check to see if the presence of 'wif' affects other words.
- In (1), the word 'dax' chains with 'wif' to produce 'green' after we get 'red'. However, when 'dax' appears after 'wif' the second time, 'green' directly follows without 'red'.
- In (3), 'wif' is preceded by 'zup', resulting in 'yellow red', indicating that 'wif' outputs 'red' regardless of its position.
- In (5), 'wif' is followed by 'lug', leading to 'red blue', just as in (2), reinforcing that 'wif' translates into 'red'.

From this evidence, it's clear that 'wif' stands alone and does not seem to affect or be affected by its neighboring words. Its presence consistently maps to 'red' in the output.

Rule: wif -> 'red'
Observing the examples given, we can notice that 'zup' consistently corresponds to the color 'yellow' in the output, independent of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words ('wif', 'lug', 'dax', etc.) which correspond to different colors ('red', 'blue', 'green', etc.).

Therefore, based on the examples provided, the rule can be stated as:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word 'zup' translates to the color 'yellow.'
Rule: bluf -> the color that the word after ""bluf"" corresponds to.

Based on the examples provided, here's how the rule applies:

Example 1: ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" maps to ""red blue blue red yellow"". The word after ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red"", so ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

Example 2: ""zup bluf"" maps to ""yellow yellow"". The word after ""bluf"" is missing, but since the output is ""yellow yellow"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" it seems that ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word when there is no word following it.

Example 3: ""lug zup bluf dax"" maps to ""blue yellow yellow green"". The word after ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green"", but the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow"", which corresponds to the preceding ""zup"". This confirms that ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word.

Example 4: ""zup bluf"" maps to ""yellow yellow"" again, further confirming that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word before it when it's the last word.

Example 5: ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" maps to ""green green red yellow green"". ""Bluf"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"", thus ""bluf"" is ""green"" here as well.

So, ""bluf"" seems to represent the color of the immediately preceding word if there is no word following it. When there is a word following it, it seems to represent the color that the following word corresponds to. However, the examples have an inconsistency in Example 3 that does not fit this rule perfectly. This inconsistency could be a mistake in the input-output pair, as it contradicts the established pattern from the other examples.

To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we should take a look at the pattern in the provided examples and compare the input and corresponding output. Let's analyze the examples:

1. Input: dax walm zup lug 
   Output: green green green yellow blue
   
2. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug 
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   
3. Input: zup bluf wif walm 
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   
4. Input: lug walm wif 
   Output: blue blue blue red
   
5. Input: dax zup walm wif 
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

Looking at the outputs, we can see that colors are assigned to words in the input. The words ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" and ""lug,"" all correlate consistently to the colors ""green,"" ""yellow,"" ""red,"" ""yellow,"" and ""blue,"" respectively. Now, we need to deduce the rule that ""walm"" follows.

Let's isolate the instances of ""walm"" and observe what happens:

1. dax walm -> green green; zup -> yellow; lug -> blue
2. walm dax lug -> green blue; wif -> red; zup and bluf -> yellow; lug -> blue
3. wif walm -> red red; zup and bluf -> yellow
4. lug walm wif -> blue blue red
5. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow red

It seems that ""walm"" takes on the color value of the word immediately following it, except in the case where ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence; then it appears to adopt the color green from ""dax"" (if present). However, ""walm"" never precedes ""dax."" Furthermore, the word after ""walm"" also seems to adopt the color of the word following it if it's not ""dax.""

So, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" replicates the color value of the immediately following word. If ""walm"" is at the end, it adopts the color green unless the preceding word provides a context for a different color (which we haven't observed yet).

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" can be articulated as:

walm -> meaning: Walm adopts the color of the following word in sequence; if at the end, defaults to green (based on the provided data).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue irrespective of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"". However, it seems that there might be an additional rule determining the number of times the color is repeated in the output. Let's analyze the occurrences:

- When ""dax"" appears alone or bookended by the same word, ""green"" is output once.
- When ""dax"" appears with two different words following it, ""green"" is repeated as many times as the number of different new words following it. For example, ""dax lug bluf dax"" has two ""green"" because there are two unique words (""lug"" and ""bluf"") between the ""dax"" words.
- When ""dax"" appears before a word that is repeated in the output, the number of repetitions of ""green"" matches the number of repetitions of the following word. For example, ""dax walm zup walm"" translates to ""green green green"" followed by ""yellow yellow yellow"", likely because ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is repeated thrice in the output.

The rule also seems to suggest that other words may have similar translation rules regarding color and repetition.

Rule: ""dax"" translates to ""green"", and the number of times ""green"" is output is dependent on the repetition and variety of the words that follow ""dax"". If ""dax"" is followed by different words, ""green"" is repeated for each unique word that follows. If ""dax"" is followed by a word that translates to a color repeated in the output, then ""green"" is repeated the same number of times as the following color.
Given the examples provided, we can begin by looking for a pattern in the occurrence of ""wif"" and the outputs provided:

Input: wif bluf zup -> Output: red red yellow
- ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red""

Input: lug dax zup lug wif -> Output: blue green yellow blue red
- ""wif"" corresponds to the last ""red""

Input: lug dax bluf wif dax -> Output: blue green green red green
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: wif -> Output: red
- ""wif"" alone produces ""red""

Input: lug walm wif bluf -> Output: blue blue blue red red
- ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" which makes it two ""reds"", and ""wif"" on its own is ""red""

From the above observations, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" consistently, regardless of its position in the sequence or the context provided by other words. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow. The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow in all the given examples.
Rule: bluf -> the color that follows the last color word mentioned before bluf.

In all provided examples, the word ""bluf"" is replaced by the color which last appeared before it. For instance:

- In the first and second examples, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" follows, so ""bluf"" is replaced by ""red.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" becomes ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is used twice. The first ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and is replaced by ""green."" The second ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" hence it is replaced by ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" so ""bluf"" is replaced by ""green.""

It’s important to note that the repetition of ""bluf"" in the same input sequence can lead to different outputs because the rule depends on the immediate context—particularly the color word that appears just before ""bluf.""
To figure out the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the correlation between the input and output sequences. It seems that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output.

Now, let's break it down:

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Input: zup walm dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow green

Input: dax walm zup lug
Output: green green green yellow blue

Input: lug dax walm
Output: blue green green green

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Analyzing these:

- ""zup"" seems to consistently correspond to yellow.
- ""dax"" seems to consistently correspond to green.
- ""lug"" seems to consistently correspond to blue.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- ""bluf"" also corresponds to red at the end.

Now, if we look at ""walm"":

- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it gives red (Example 1).
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" it gives yellow (Example 2 and 5).
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" it gives green (Example 3 and 4).

It appears that the word ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it. So, if ""wif"" comes before ""walm,"" it becomes red; if ""zup"" comes before ""walm,"" it becomes yellow; if ""dax"" comes before ""walm,"" it becomes green, and so on.

Rule: walm -> takes on the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, here is the deduced meaning of the nonce word ""dax"":

Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""walm"" seems to correspond to ""green"" since it's repeated for each occurrence of ""walm"" in the output.

Input: dax lug wif
Output: green blue red
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: dax
Output: green
- ""dax"" stands alone and corresponds to ""green""

Input: zup dax walm
Output: yellow green green green
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""walm"" seems to consistently correspond to ""green""

Input: wif lug dax lug
Output: red blue green blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- The second occurrence of ""lug"" still corresponds to ""blue""

In every example provided, the word ""dax"" always corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to a specific color in the output. The examples show that language inputs are mapped to color outputs, with each unique word corresponding to a unique color. To deduce the rule, we'll correlate the appearance of ""wif"" in the input to the corresponding color in the output.

Input: wif dax zup dax  
Output: red green yellow green  
Rule Deduction: ""wif"" -> red; ""dax"" -> green; ""zup"" -> yellow

Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup  
Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow  
Rule Deduction: ""zup"" -> yellow; ""bluf"" -> yellow; ""wif"" -> red; ""dax"" -> green

Input: wif dax zup dax  
Output: red green yellow green  
Rule Confirmation: ""wif"" -> red; ""dax"" -> green; ""zup"" -> yellow

Input: dax lug bluf wif  
Output: green blue blue red  
Rule Deduction: ""dax"" -> green; ""lug"" -> blue; ""bluf"" -> blue; ""wif"" -> red

Input: dax wif lug dax  
Output: green red blue green  
Rule Confirmation: ""dax"" -> green; ""wif"" -> red; ""lug"" -> blue

Based on the consistent translation of ""wif"" to ""red"" in every example, the rule is as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce:

- The same input always leads to the same output: 'zup' consistently translates to 'yellow'.
- Inputs such as 'dax' and 'lug' seem to produce outputs of 'green' and 'blue', respectively. However, 'dax' once translated to 'green green' and 'bluf' to 'green green', suggesting that a repeat of the word may not be listed but implied in the output. 
- The word 'walm' is a bit more complex, as 'walm zup lug walm' translates to 'green green green yellow blue blue blue', implying that perhaps 'walm' suggests a repetition of the following and preceding colors, but the sequences provided aren't enough to fully confirm this.

Considering just the information given for 'zup', we can determine a specific rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, the rule concerning the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be:

For each instance of the word ""bluf,"" it takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Going through the examples:

Example 1:
Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
In the first instance, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to blue. In the second instance, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to yellow.

Example 2:
Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which translates to green.

Example 3:
Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green
""Bluf"" first follows ""lug"" (blue) and then ""zup"" (yellow).

Example 4:
Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
In this case, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which has already been established to translate to blue.

Example 5:
Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red
Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which translates to red.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.
Based on the outputs given for each input containing ""walm,"" we can try to deduce the rule by comparing the segments of input and output.

1. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"".
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".
   - ""walm"" appears to add three ""blue"" after a ""lug"".

2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green"".
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".
   - Following ""lug"", ""walm"" again results in three ""blue"".

3. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red"".
   - ""bluf"" is likely a typo for ""lug"", which would maintain consistency with ""blue"".
   - ""walm"" after ""lug"" again leads to three ""blue"".

4. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
   - ""walm"", when following ""wif"", results in three ""red"".

5. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   - ""walm"", still following ""wif"", results in three ""red"".
   - ""lug"" at the end translates to ""blue"".

From the evidence, we can see that ""walm"" results in a triplet of a color. After ""lug"", ""walm"" translates to three instances of ""blue"", and after ""wif"", it produces three instances of ""red"". 

Rule: ""walm"" translates to three instances of the color produced by the word preceding it. If the preceding word is ""lug"" it generates ""blue"", and if it's ""wif"" it generates ""red"". There is no information on what happens if ""walm"" follows ""dax"" or ""zup"", but from the given data, the rule seems to rely on the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"".

Therefore:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: Generates a triplet of the color associated with the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"". Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" can be stated as:

zup -> yellow

Rule: ""zup"" means ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
bluf -> red

Rule: The output for the nonce word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the provided examples. Each occurrence of ""bluf"" directly translates to ""red"" in the output sequence.
Analyzing the given examples:

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" results in ""green,"" and ""walm"" also results in ""green.""

2. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - We know from other examples that ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" ""wif"" in ""red,"" and ""lug"" in ""blue."" The ""walm"" following a ""zup"" at the end results in ""yellow.""

3. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   - The sequence includes ""wif"" resulting in ""red,"" ""dax"" in ""green,"" ""zup"" in ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" in ""blue."" It appears that ""walm"" after ""wif"" results again in ""red,"" and ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in ""blue.""

4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - As before, both ""dax"" and ""walm"" lead to ""green.""

5. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue red blue
   - ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" ""walm"" after ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and then ""lug"" again leads to ""blue.""

Based on the examples, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Therefore, after ""dax"" which is ""green,"" ""walm"" is ""green."" After ""lug"" which is ""blue,"" ""walm"" is ""blue,"" and after ""wif"" which is ""red,"" ""walm"" is ""red."" However, after ""zup"" which should be ""yellow,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which might indicate that ""walm"" after ""zup"" repeats the color more than once (i.e., thrice).

Rule: walm -> repeater of the preceding word's color, with the special case of repeating the color three times if the preceding word is ""zup.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
Based on the given examples, we can infer the following pattern:

- Each instance of ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- Each instance of ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- The word ""walm"" seems to correspond to the color ""green,"" except when it follows the word ""dax.""
- The word ""dax"" directly corresponds to the color ""green."" 

However, there is an interesting observation that when ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" it also corresponds to the output ""green,"" whereas in other cases, it corresponds to ""red."" This suggests that ""dax"" may have an influence on the subsequent word, changing its associated color to ""green.""

Given this, the possible rule for ""dax"" is:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" and it also turns the following word's output into ""green,"" if that word is ""walm.""

So, the meaning can be deduced as:

dax -> green (with an additional rule that if ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" then ""walm"" also translates to ""green"" rather than its default color)
Analyzing the examples:

1. Input: wif
   Output: red
   Interpretation: wif means red

2. Input: dax wif lug dax
   Output: green red blue green
   Interpretation: dax means green, wif means red, lug means blue

3. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
   Output: red green yellow red green green
   Interpretation: wif means red, dax means green, zup means yellow, bluf means green

4. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   Interpretation: wif means red, zup means yellow, bluf means yellow (?), lug means blue, walm means blue

5. Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
   Output: yellow red red yellow blue
   Interpretation: zup means yellow, wif means red, bluf means red (?), lug means blue

Notice that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"", but there's an inconsistency with ""bluf"" which corresponds to ""green"" in one instance and ""red"" in two instances. Given the provided information, we can't be absolutely certain of ""bluf"" without further context or examples. However, ""wif"" is consistent across all examples.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
bluf -> red. Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in each given example.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a series of red outputs that match the number of preceding words before ""walm."" To be more precise:

- When ""walm"" is preceded by three words as in ""zup bluf wif walm,"" the output is three reds: ""red red red.""
- When preceded by two words as in ""dax walm wif,"" the output includes two reds: ""green green red.""
- And similarly, when ""walm"" follows one word as in ""wif walm,"" the output is one red: ""red red.""

Thus, the following rule seems to apply:

Rule: ""walm"" -> a series of reds in the output equal to the number of words preceding ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Regardless of context or position within the sequence, 'lug' consistently translates to 'blue'.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to the word ""green."" Each time ""dax"" is used in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding output at the same position.

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Here is how we can deduce this:

- Input: wif dax → Output: red green
- Input: wif → Output: red
- Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf → Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
- Input: lug bluf wif → Output: blue blue red
- Input: wif dax bluf → Output: red green green

In each case where ""wif"" appears, the corresponding output always includes ""red."" Furthermore, when ""wif"" is the only word in the input, the only color in the output is ""red."" This consistent mapping across all examples indicates a rule where ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each input containing ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" appearing in the same position in the output. The word that follows ""zup"" seems to determine the second color. For example:

- ""wif"" after ""zup"" becomes ""red.""
- ""bluf"" after ""zup"" becomes ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup"" but results in ""red"" when preceded by ""wif"" instead.
- ""lug"" after ""zup"" becomes ""blue.""

It's also noteworthy that the position of ""zup"" in the input doesn't affect the output color it corresponds to, but the position of the other words does. ""wif"" before ""zup"" turns into ""red"" whereas ""wif"" after ""zup"" also turns into ""red."" However, ""bluf"" changes based on its position relative to ""zup.""

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> ""yellow""

The general pattern here is that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output, irrespective of its position or the other words around it.
Based on the given examples, we can observe a pattern where the word ""bluf"" is related to the color red, and it is repeated once more than the number of words preceding ""bluf"" in a given input. Here's how the rule works for each example:

1. Input: ""wif walm lug bluf"" 
   Output: ""red red red blue blue""
   Rule: 3 words before ""bluf"" -> 3 reds + ""bluf"" repeated once more as blue.

2. Input: ""zup wif bluf""
   Output: ""yellow red red""
   Rule: 2 words before ""bluf"" -> 2 reds starting with the color yellow + ""bluf"" as red.

3. Input: ""dax walm wif bluf""
   Output: ""green green green red red""
   Rule: 3 words before ""bluf"" -> 3 reds (but starting with green) + ""bluf"" repeated once more as red.

4. Input: ""lug bluf wif""
   Output: ""blue blue red""
   Rule: 1 word before ""bluf"" -> 1 red (but stated as blue) + ""bluf"" as blue.

5. Input: ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug""
   Output: ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue""
   Rule: 3 words before first ""bluf"" -> 2 reds (starting with yellow, but second red as green) + first ""bluf"" as red; second ""bluf"" after 2 yellows and is expressed as blue.

Considering the above analyses and looking for consistency across all examples, it is evident that the word ""bluf"" represents the color red, but has a repeated output based on the number of words preceding it in the sequence, while the initial color of the sequence varies and might not be directly related to the word ""bluf.""

Rule: ""bluf"" -> red, repeated one more time than the number of words before it in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be translated into a pattern of repetition of the color that immediately precedes it. Analyzing each case:

Input: zup dax walm
Output: yellow green green green
- ""Walm"" followed ""dax"" which was translated to ""green,"" resulting in a repetition of ""green"" three times.

Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
- ""Walm"" followed ""zup"" which was translated to ""yellow,"" resulting in a repetition of ""yellow"" three times.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- ""Walm"" followed ""dax"" which was translated to ""green,"" resulting in a repetition of ""green"" three times.

Input: lug walm zup lug walm
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
- The first ""walm"" followed ""lug"" which was translated to ""blue,"" resulting in a repetition of ""blue"" three times.
- The second ""walm"" again followed ""lug,"" which was translated to ""blue,"" resulting in another repetition of ""blue"" three times.

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red
- ""Walm"" followed ""zup"" which was translated to ""yellow,"" resulting in a repetition of ""yellow"" three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax
    ",Output: red green,red green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, dax appears to be an instruction that introduces the color green. When dax is present, the output includes the color green following the position of dax in the input sequence. The color green does not appear in the output when dax is not in the input sequence. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> introduces the color green in the output sequence.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" translates consistently to ""red"" in every instance it appears. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red
From the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"". The word ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" as well. We don't have examples of ""zup"" being used in other contexts that would imply a different meaning, so it looks like the meaning of ""zup"" is context-independent. Therefore, based on the examples, the rule seems to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look at how it is used in various examples and the corresponding output. Let's analyze each instance where ""bluf"" appears and the colors that correspond to it:

1. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue red green green red
   - Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color green.

2. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
   Output: red green yellow red green green
   - Here, again, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color green.

3. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   - Here, the first ""red"" corresponds to the first ""wif,"" and the second instance of green corresponds to ""bluf,"" following the pattern that ""bluf"" represents the color green.

4. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   - Here, ""wif"" must correspond to the first ""red,"" which implies that ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red."" However, this conflicts with previous instances unless ""bluf"" takes on the same color as the color word that precedes it.

5. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - Here, the first ""yellow"" corresponds to ""zup,"" and the second ""yellow"" corresponds to ""bluf,"" indicating that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding color word (which was ""yellow"" in this case).

Given the examples, it seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it. If there is no preceding color word, it defaults to red, as seen in examples 3 and 4.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding color word; if no preceding color word, defaults to red.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" translates to three repetitions of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here's the breakdown for each example:

1. dax walm -> green green green (where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"")
   
2. lug walm zup wif -> blue blue blue (where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""), followed by the colors for ""zup"" and ""wif"" which are ""yellow"" and ""red"" respectively.

3. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow (where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"")

4. wif walm zup walm -> red red red (where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"") followed by ""yellow yellow yellow"" (where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"")

5. wif lug zup walm wif lug -> ""red"" (for ""wif""), ""blue"" (for ""lug""), followed by ""yellow yellow yellow"" (where ""zup"" before ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"") and then followed by the colors for ""wif"" and ""lug"" which are ""red"" and ""blue"" respectively.

The pattern suggests that ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the word that comes directly before it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each provided example, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" by analyzing the patterns between the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

From the first example:
Input: dax lug dax lug wif
Output: green blue green blue red

We see that each occurrence of ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" Notably, each ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

From the second example:
Input: wif dax zup walm
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

Here we see that ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and the single occurrence of ""zup"" leads to a ""yellow."" The last ""walm"" generates three ""yellow"" colors in sequence.

From the third example:
Input: wif dax lug walm
Output: red green blue blue blue

Following the pattern, ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" generates repetition in the color corresponding to the word preceding it; thus, three instances of ""blue"" are outputted following ""lug.""

From the fourth example:
Input: zup dax
Output: yellow green

In this example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green"" once again.

From the fifth example:
Input: dax lug dax lug walm
Output: green blue green blue blue blue

As before, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and as ""lug"" is the last word before ""walm,"" the repetition rule inferred from the ""walm"" occurrences applies, causing multiple instances of ""blue"" to follow.

Given the consistent representation of ""dax"" as ""green"" in every example, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the meaning of the word ""zup"" can be deduced as follows:

- In the first example, ""lug dax zup wif"" translates to ""blue green yellow red,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" which indicates that ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" as ""bluf"" seems to also mean ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow,"" further supporting that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
- The fourth example, ""zup wif dax walm lug,"" translates to ""yellow red green green green blue,"" which is consistent with the previous translations of ""zup"" as ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup lug"" translates to ""yellow blue,"" where ""lug"" has been consistently translated as ""blue,"" and ""zup"" as ""yellow"" again.

Rule: zup -> yellow
According to the given examples, each instance of the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a particular color in the output. By examining each pair, we can try to deduce the rule for ""bluf.""

In all instances, ""bluf"" is followed by the output ""blue."" Therefore, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue in these examples.

Rule: bluf -> blue.
Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color that represents the word that directly precedes it three times. 

For example:
- In ""zup walm wif"", ""zup"" stands for yellow, so ""walm"" means ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In ""lug walm"", ""lug"" means blue, hence ""walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"".
- When ""walm"" comes after other words that have been assigned a color but are followed by different color-representing words, it still repeats the color of the word right before it, thrice.

Therefore: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every given example.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each unique word is associated with a specific color. The word ""dax"" consistently results in the color ""green."" The word ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""zup"" and ""bluf"" both result in ""yellow."" Thus:

Rule: 
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently maps to the color ""yellow."" Each occurrence of ""zup"" in the input strings corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output strings, regardless of the position of ""zup"" within the sequence or the words that surround it. Other words, like ""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""bluf,"" and ""wif,"" are associated with their own respective colors in the output.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" is:

zup -> yellow

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
To deduce the rule for ""bluf,"" let's look closely at how it correlates with the output in each example:

1. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green
   
2. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   
3. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   
4. Input: zup bluf lug dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow blue green blue
   
5. Input: wif bluf zup
   Output: red red yellow

From examples 1 and 2, every time ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the color green is repeated in the output. Likewise, in examples 3 and 5, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" yielding a repeated red in the output. In example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and yellow is repeated.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color associated with the preceding word.
Based on the examples given, we can see the following:

Input: dax walm lug -> Output: green green green blue
Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green
Input: zup lug walm -> Output: yellow blue blue blue
Input: zup lug walm -> Output: yellow blue blue blue
Input: lug walm wif lug -> Output: blue blue blue red blue

It looks like ""walm"" is generating the color ""blue"" in the output, as long as it follows the pattern where ""lug"" is present either before or after ""walm"". We do not have an example without ""lug"" present to confirm if ""walm"" can stand alone as ""blue"".

According to the provided examples:
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""

Based on this, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be as follows:

Rule: The word ""walm"" translates to ""green"" when preceded by ""dax,"" and translates to ""blue"" when preceded by ""lug"" or followed by ""lug.""

Therefore, walm -> blue (when in the context of ""lug""), walm -> green (when following ""dax"").

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    ",Output: yellow blue blue blue red yellow green,yellow yellow yellow blue blue blue red yellow green,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output. Here are the inferred rules:

Input: wif dax lug walm -> Output: red green blue blue blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Input: zup lug dax -> Output: yellow blue green
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Input: lug -> Output: blue
- ""lug"" by itself still corresponds to ""blue""

Input: dax lug -> Output: green blue
- ""lug"" follows ""dax"" and corresponds to ""blue"" regardless

Input: dax lug -> Output: green blue
- ""lug"" after ""dax"" still corresponds to ""blue""

Rule:
lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in these examples.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to analyze the patterns in the given examples.

Looking at the first example:
- Input: zup wif dax
- Output: yellow red green

Here, ""wif"" is between ""zup"" and ""dax,"" and corresponds to ""red"" in the output. ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Now let's see the second example:
- Input: dax walm wif walm
- Output: green green green red red red

The repeated ""walm"" at the end of the input corresponds to a repeated ""green"" at the end of the output. ""Wif"" is after ""dax"" and ""walm"" and before the repetition of ""walm,"" which results in the corresponding ""red"" before the repeated ""green"" in the output. This suggests that one occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to one occurrence of ""red.""

The third example:
- Input: dax wif
- Output: green red

Again, ""wif"" follows ""dax"" and translates to ""red"" in the output, just like in the first example.

The fourth example:
- Input: wif
- Output: red

Here, ""wif"" is the only element in the input, and it still outputs ""red.""

Finally, the fifth example:
- Input: lug wif
- Output: blue red

In this case, ""wif"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds with ""blue,"" and still, ""wif"" corresponds with ""red.""

Considering all of the examples, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input or the elements that come before or after it.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, there is a consistent output every time the word ""zup"" appears. Regardless of its position in a sequence, ""zup"" always corresponds to the output ""yellow"". There is no variation in the output that depends on the context or its position within the list of other words, suggesting that ""zup"" has a specific, unchanging meaning.

Rule: zup -> yellow. ""Zup"" means ""yellow"".
Based on the examples provided, it appears that:

1. When the input ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow blue.""
2. When the input ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue.""
3. When the input ""bluf"" is surrounded by a mix of other words (""wif,"" ""dax,"" ""lug,"" and so on), the output immediately following ""bluf"" is ""blue.""

Since the color ""blue"" follows the nonce word ""bluf"" in all given outputs and the presence of other words does not seem to alter this result, it is reasonable to conclude that ""bluf"" correlates with the color ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> blue
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we'll first look for patterns in the examples provided, focusing particularly on the relationship between the input ""walm"" and the corresponding output colors.

Let's break the inputs and outputs down:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

2. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red

3. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

4. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

5. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

Analyzing the Outputs Related to ""Walm"":

- In the first example, ""walm"" precedes ""dax"" and the colors are red red. In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the colors are green green.
- In the third example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and both are blue.
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" again precedes ""walm"" and both are blue, with ""wif"" following ""walm"" and the color sequence is blue blue red.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and ""zup"" follows the first occurrence of ""walm,"" which results in green green yellow. ""Lug"" follows the second occurrence of ""walm,"" resulting in blue blue.

One pattern that emerges is that the output color after ""walm"" is often the same as the color before it. Additionally, we can see that ""lug"" before ""walm"" consistently yields blue, and ""dax"" before ""walm"" yields green.

Hypothesis:

- ""Walm"" may represent a rule that says ""repeat the color of the preceding word"" or ""take the color of the preceding word as the output if there is one; if 'walm' is the first word, default to red"" since the first time we see ""walm"" without a preceding word it is related to red.

Let's test this hypothesis:

- In the first example, there's no word before ""walm,"" so it defaults to red.
- In the second example, ""dax"" (green) precedes ""walm"" and ""walm"" is also green.
- In the third example, ""lug"" (blue) precedes ""walm"" and ""walm"" is also blue.
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" (blue) precedes ""walm"" and ""walm"" is also blue.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" (green) precedes the first ""walm"" and both are green, and ""zup"" (yellow) follows. Then ""lug"" (blue) precedes the second ""walm"" and both are blue.

This hypothesis seems to hold true based on the provided examples. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word in the input. If ""walm"" is the first word, output red.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding context.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following correlations between the inputs and outputs:

- Every time the word ""dax"" appears, the color ""green"" is in the output.
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

However, there is a conflict in the information provided since the word ""bluf"" has been associated with both ""yellow"" and ""green."" Since ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green,"" we can assume that any anomalies might be due to a mistake in the examples, or that ""bluf"" has a context-dependent meaning which is not clear from the examples given. Focusing on the word ""dax"":

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the colors corresponding to each instance where it appears:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red""

2. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to the second to last ""red""

3. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to the last ""red""

4. Input: lug zup wif lug
   Output: blue yellow red blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

5. Input: lug dax wif lug
   Output: blue green red blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

In each instance where ""wif"" appears, it corresponds to the color ""red."" However, the placement of ""red"" in the sequence doesn't seem to follow a position-based rule considering the variable position of the word ""wif"" in inputs and the corresponding ""red"" in the outputs. The commonality is simply the presence of the color ""red.""

The rule derived from these examples is:

wif -> meaning: ""red""

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""red.""
Considering the examples given, the rule appears to be that ""zup"" indicates a repetition of the color associated with the previous word. Each word except ""zup"" seems to represent a unique color, and when ""zup"" is used it repeats the color of the word before it.

Let's verify this rule:

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red
Analysis: Here ""walm"" must represent yellow, and ""zup"" repeats this color twice before ""wif"" introduces red.

Input: zup lug dax lug
Output: yellow blue green blue
Analysis: Here ""zup"" precedes ""lug,"" and the output starts with yellow, so ""lug"" must represent blue, and ""zup"" takes on its color. ""dax"" is green, and ""lug"" is repeated as blue.

Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
Analysis: ""wif"" represents red, and ""walm"" follows it, so it also has to be red. ""dax"" changes the color to green, then ""zup"" repeats this color as yellow, indicating that ""zup"" is taking green's color here. Next are two ""wif,"" which are red, followed by ""lug"" which is blue, and then ""walm,"" which continues to be blue according to our rule.

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
Analysis: ""zup"" leads and suggests repetition, but since there is no prior word, we assume ""walm"" following it is yellow. Thus, ""zup"" repeats this yellow. ""lug"" switches the color to blue, and ""zup"" then repeats blue. ""wif"" brings in red and ""dax"" introduces green.

Input: lug zup dax zup
Output: blue yellow green yellow
Analysis: ""lug"" is blue, and ""zup"" repeats blue, resulting in yellow according to the sequence, which means there could be a mistake here according to the established pattern. However, assuming ""zup"" should repeat blue but the color yellow is given instead suggests potential confusion about the associated colors for ""zup"" or ""lug."" ""dax"" is consistent with green, and the last ""zup"" should repeat this green but does again result in yellow.

In light of the inconsistency noted in the last example, it appears that there is a mistake in the stated outputs for the inputs involving ""lug"" and ""zup."" Assuming that other sequences are accurate, the rule that ""zup"" repeats the color of the previous word still stands. However, due to the discrepancy in the final example, the conclusion may not be perfect. Given the information, the best deduction while acknowledging the potential error in the examples is:

Rule: zup -> repeats the color associated with the previous word.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" means to repeat the color associated with the word before it. If ""wif"" is red, ""wif bluf"" produces ""red red."" If ""dax"" is green, ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green,"" and if ""lug"" is blue, ""lug bluf"" yields ""blue blue.""
walm -> triple repetition of the previous color.

Rule: When preceded by another word (which corresponds to a color), ""walm"" results in that color being said three times. For example: 

- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. 

Whenever ""walm"" is used without any preceding color word, the rule cannot be applied, as there is no previous color to repeat three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in all examples provided.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". Regardless of its position in the input sequence, ""dax"" always results in ""green"" in the output sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's observe the patterns in the examples provided:

- ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green yellow red green green""
- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" -> ""blue red blue green green""
- ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow""
- ""wif bluf lug zup"" -> ""red red blue yellow""

Here are the observations:

1. Every instance of ""wif"" in the examples directly translates to the color ""red.""
2. No other word corresponds to ""red"" in the given examples.
3. No contextual or positional variance is seen that alters the translation of ""wif.""

Based on these consistent observations across the examples, the rule can be deduced as:

Rule: The word ""wif"" directly corresponds to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position or the words around it.

Therefore, wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow."" Therefore, we can infer that:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears as input, the output is ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" in each instance when converted from the input to the output. In each example, the presence of ""bluf"" in the input consistently corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output. Here is the rule inferred:

Rule: bluf -> red.
Based on the examples provided, we can derive the following patterns:

1. wif consistently translates to red.
2. lug consistently translates to blue.
3. dax consistently translates to green.
4. zup consistently translates to yellow.

Looking at the use of walm in the sentences and the corresponding outputs, it appears that walm duplicates the color of the word that precedes it. Each time walm appears, the color that is outputted is identical to the color outputted for the word right before walm.

For instance:
- In ""wif lug dax walm"", the word before walm is ""dax"", which outputs green, so walm also outputs green (and is repeated twice more).
- In ""wif walm"", the word before walm is ""wif"", which outputs red, leading ""walm"" to output red (repeated two more times).
- In ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"", the word before walm is ""zup"", which outputs yellow, and hence walm results in three yellows outputted right after.

Now applying these observations to the rule:

Rule: walm -> Replicates the color of the directly preceding word and repeats it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup lug
    ",Output: yellow blue,yellow blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue,"" and the additional word following ""lug"" corresponds to another color. ""dax"" equates to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" When ""lug"" is provided without a second word, only the color ""blue"" is outputted.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" is consistently associated with the color green in the given examples, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, we can induce a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"". There is a pattern where each instance of ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red"". Regardless of the position of ""wif"" within the input sequence or the words surrounding it, ""wif"" consistently results in ""red"" as part of the output. There are no examples given that suggest ""wif"" has a different meaning or any conditions under which its associated output changes.

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> meaning. Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
From the examples given, we can induce the following associations for each word:

- ""zup"" is consistently associated with the color ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green.""
- ""lug"" is associated with the color ""blue.""
- ""bluf"" appears once and is associated with ""yellow,"" which might imply that ""bluf"" has the same meaning as ""zup"" or it might imply that we don't have enough information to determine its meaning with certainty.
- ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which might suggest a repetition or augmentation of the concept associated with ""zup,"" but again, we only have one instance of ""walm,"" making it hard to determine a precise rule for it.

Based on the information provided, the rule seems to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow

Given that the output is consistent across all examples when ""zup"" is present, we can confidently deduce that ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
Given the examples provided, let's examine the sequence of inputs versus outputs to deduce the meaning of ""bluf.""

Looking at the first input-output pair:

- Input: zup bluf
- Output: yellow yellow

Every occurrence of ""zup"" is matched with ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""yellow"" in this instance.

Now, let's consider the second example:

- Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
- Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red

Here, ""zup"" is still represented as ""yellow,"" and every occurrence of ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" once again. ""Lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

Continuing with the examples:

- Input: dax walm wif bluf
- Output: green green green red red

It appears ""dax"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and in this case, ""bluf"" would be ""red.""

For the last example:

- Input: wif bluf lug zup
- Output: red red blue yellow

Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" now corresponds to ""red.""

To figure out the pattern, we notice that ""bluf"" matches the color of the word that directly precedes it, except for the first occurrence in which no word precedes it, and by default, it matches the color corresponding to ""zup."" Therefore:

bluf -> The same color as the preceding word; if there is no preceding word, it is yellow (the color assigned to ""zup"").
walm -> meaning. Meaning: repeating the color associated with the previous word multiple times.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the color associated with the previous word is repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug wif lug
    ",Output: green blue red blue,green blue red blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the word ""lug"" is consistently translated as ""blue"" in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"", regardless of its position in the input sequence. It seems to translate directly to ""red"" when it appears alone or as part of a sequence. Other words in the sequence correspond to other colors (""zup"" to ""yellow"", ""dax"" to ""green""), but ""wif"" consistently means ""red"".
zup -> meaning. Rule: Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".
Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Justification of Rule:
- In example 1, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the output for both is green.
- In example 2, ""bluf"" first follows ""wif,"" and then it again follows ""lug,"" resulting in red and blue, respectively.
- In example 3, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and both yield the color yellow.
- In example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" so both generate the color red.
- In example 5, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is yellow for both.

Thus, the rule for the word ""bluf"" seems to be that it mirrors the color of the word that comes before it.

Hence, bluf -> the color of the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" consistently translates into three consecutive ""red"" outputs in the sequence. Here's a breakdown of each example to illustrate this:

1. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   - Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""walm"" leads to three additional ""red.""

2. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" leads to three ""red,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" followed by another ""walm"" which also converts to three ""red,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

3. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   - ""lug"" is ""blue,"" followed by ""walm"" which results in three ""red,"" but here it's enveloped by ""blue"" suggesting that the preceding color might repeat before the series of reds caused by ""walm,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue.""

4. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   - ""wif"" matches ""red,"" followed by ""walm,"" which results in two more ""red"" to make a total of three ""red.""

5. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""walm"" leads to two more ""reds,"" and ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

From the examples, the conclusion can be drawn that ""walm"" leads to the output of three consecutive ""red"" regardless of what precedes or follows it. There is a slight ambiguity in the third example, which might suggest the presence of an additional rule regarding the surrounding words, but based on the information given, the simplest conclusion is that ""walm"" relates directly to the output of ""red red red.""

Rule: walm -> three consecutive ""red"" in the output sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow,yellow yellow yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Rule: Lug means blue.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" seems to consistently correspond to the color ""green."" The word ""wif"" comes after ""dax"" and is associated with the color ""red."" It appears as a separator between repetitions of ""dax"" and each occurrence of ""dax"" results in the color ""green"" being output again.

For the last example, ""dax bluf wif zup wif,"" the term ""dax"" at the beginning leads to ""green"" as expected. ""Bluf"" follows ""dax"" and translates to ""green,"" indicating that ""bluf"" also means ""green"" or is contextually interpreted as such in this string. There's then ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" followed finally by ""zup,"" which is associated with ""yellow,"" and another ""wif,"" without a term following, suggesting a pattern of ""wif"" possibly signaling the end of a color sequence with ""red.""

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red

Each example that includes the word ""wif"" corresponds to an output where ""red"" is always present. Regardless of its position in the input (beginning, middle, or by itself), ""wif"" consistently leads to ""red"" appearing in the output. Therefore, it can be deduced that ""wif"" means ""red"".
To deduce the meaning of ""zup"", we need to examine how the output changes when ""zup"" occurs in the input in each example.

Input 1: zup dax
Output 1: yellow green

Input 2: lug zup
Output 2: blue yellow

Input 3: zup dax lug walm zup lug
Output 3: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

Input 4: zup lug
Output 4: yellow blue

Input 5: zup wif bluf
Output 5: yellow red red

From the given examples, we notice the following:
- Whenever ""zup"" appears, the first color in the output is always ""yellow.""
- The presence of ""zup"" does not affect the colors that follow, which suggests ""zup"" translates directly to ""yellow"" and does not affect the translation of subsequent words.

So the rule we deduce from the examples provided is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it appears that different nonce words correspond to different colors as follows:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green

The word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color blue. Therefore, the rule for the word ""bluf"" seems to be:

bluf -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" means ""blue"".
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be related to the repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.

Here are the observations:

1. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
   (The word before 'walm' is 'dax', which produces 'green', and the output is three instances of 'green'.)

2. dax walm -> green green green
   (The word before 'walm' is 'dax', which produces 'green', and the output is three instances of 'green'.)

3. lug walm -> blue blue blue
   (The word before 'walm' is 'lug', which produces 'blue', and the output is three instances of 'blue'.)

4. lug wif dax zup walm -> blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   (The word before 'walm' is 'zup', which produces 'yellow', and the output is three instances of 'yellow'.)

5. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
   (The word before 'walm' is 'zup', which produces 'yellow', and the output is three instances of 'yellow'.)

From these observations, the pattern indicates that ""walm"" represents the repetition of the color associated with the previous word three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples given, it appears that each word translates to a specific color.

- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
- ""walm"" seems to translate to a repetition of the previous color mentioned three times.

Considering these translations, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to analyze the patterns in the given input and output examples and look for correlations. Let's examine each case to determine the rule.

From the provided examples:

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   
2. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   
3. Input: zup dax zup
   Output: yellow green yellow
   
4. Input: dax zup lug bluf
   Output: green yellow blue blue
   
5. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow

Considering the outputs, it's apparent that each word in the input is translated to a colored word in the output. Now, let's see if we can identify a pattern for ""dax"":

1. In the first example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" which suggests that ""dax"" might mean ""green,"" as ""walm"" also corresponds to the color green based on the repetition in the output.
   
2. In the second example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green,"" which again shows ""dax"" as ""green,"" as the last two words ""dax walm"" give us ""green green,"" mirroring the first example.

3. In the third example, ""zup dax zup"" translates to ""yellow green yellow,"" implying that ""dax"" is surrounded by ""zup,"" which means yellow, reinforcing the idea that ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

4. In the fourth example, ""dax zup lug bluf"" translates to ""green yellow blue blue."" Here, we see that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" once again, with ""zup"" as ""yellow,"" and ""bluf,"" which in the second example was ""red,"" now appears as ""blue.""

5. The fifth example, ""dax zup bluf,"" which becomes ""green yellow yellow,"" introduces an inconsistency regarding ""bluf."" Previously, it has translated as ""red"" and ""blue,"" but here, it appears to mean ""yellow."" It's important to note that the colors in the output are not unique to each nonce word—different nonce words can produce the same color.

Given these observations, we can deduce the meaning of ""dax"":

Rule: dax -> ""green""

The meaning of ""dax"" seems to consistently translate to the word ""green"" in the given examples. However, the color translation of other words can vary, which may imply there are additional contextual rules affecting those translations that have not been explicitly provided in the examples.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position within the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's look at each input and its corresponding output to find a pattern.

Input: zup dax zup wif
Output: yellow green yellow red

Input: zup bluf wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow red red

Input: wif bluf zup
Output: red red yellow

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red

Analyzing the examples, we can see that each time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output. This is consistent across all examples. There are no instances where ""zup"" corresponds to a different color. This suggests a direct rule that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule can be written as:
zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the word ""blue"" in the output sequence. Additionally, it can be observed that other words surrounding ""bluf"" correspond to different colors. It appears that there is a one-to-one mapping between input words and output colors:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Given this pattern, ""bluf"" would likely correspond to the color ""blue"". However, with each occurrence of ""bluf"" in the inputs, the output contains ""blue"" followed by the color corresponding to the previous word. If ""bluf"" is the first word in the sequence or follows ""lug"" (which also maps to ""blue""), then there are two consecutive ""blue"" in the output.

Rule: bluf -> blue, preceded by the color that corresponds to the word directly before it in the sequence. If ""bluf"" is the first word or follows ""lug,"" then the output is simply ""blue"" twice.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the examples provided:

1. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   
2. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue

3. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

4. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

5. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

From the output, we can deduce the following rules for the colors corresponding to each word:

- ""dax"" corresponds to green
- ""wif"" corresponds to red
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow

The word ""walm"" appears to multiply the color that comes just before it. Taking each example into account:

(1) ""wif walm"" results in three reds following it.
(2) ""lug walm"" results in three blues following it.
(3) ""wif walm"" again results in three reds.
(4) ""lug walm"" once more results in three blues.
(5) And lastly ""wif walm"" produces three reds.

Notably, in each case ""walm"" does not have a color of its own; it multiplies the previous color mentioned by two, resulting in a total of three instances of that color in the output (one from the original word, plus two additional from ""walm"").

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: walm -> Triplicates the color associated with the word just before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can observe the following patterns:

Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
- 'wif' corresponds to 'red'
- 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'
- 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'
- 'walm' is not repeated, but its corresponding output is 'yellow'

Input: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup
Output: blue blue red blue blue yellow
- 'bluf' corresponds to 'blue'
- 'wif' continues to correspond to 'red'
- 'lug' continues to correspond to 'blue'
- 'zup' still corresponds to 'yellow'

Input: lug dax lug wif
Output: blue green blue red
- 'dax' corresponds to 'green'
- 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'
- 'wif' corresponds to 'red'

Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
Output: green green red blue yellow
- 'dax' corresponds to 'green'
- 'bluf' corresponds to 'blue'
- 'wif' corresponds to 'red'
- 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'
- 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'

Input: lug dax
Output: blue green
- 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'
- 'dax' corresponds to 'green'

By observing the corresponding outputs for 'lug' across all input examples, we can deduce that 'lug' consistently corresponds to 'blue'.

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

Reviewing the examples and correlating the ""dax"" occurrences with the output, we can see that every time the input includes ""dax"", the corresponding output is ""green"".
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Each time ""wif"" is mentioned in the input, the output is ""red"".
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be as follows:

When the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the output contains the color word ""red"" repeated as many times as there are letters in the word immediately preceding ""bluf"". 

Let's verify this rule with the given examples:

1. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   Reasoning: ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and has three letters, hence ""yellow"" is repeated twice (not following the deduced rule).

2. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green
   Reasoning: ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and has three letters, so ""red"" is repeated twice, ""dax"" follows ""bluf"" and results in ""green.""

3. Input: wif bluf dax lug
   Output: red red green blue
   Reasoning: The presence of ""bluf"" still results in two ""red"" because of ""wif,"" followed by ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""blue"" for ""lug.""

4. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   Reasoning: ""bluf"" is still preceded by ""wif,"" resulting in two ""red,"" then ""green"" for ""dax,"" and three ""green"" for ""walm"" (which has four letters).

5. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   Reasoning: ""bluf"" is again preceded by ""zup,"" but the result is two ""yellow"" (which does not support the rule related to the number of letters).

Upon further examination, the rule deduced doesn't consistently explain the transition from the input to the output. However, one pattern that appears consistent is that ""bluf"" always translates to ""red red"" regardless of the preceding word. It is worth noting that the translation of other words (like ""dax"" or ""lug"") is static, so ""dax"" converts to ""green"" and ""lug"" converts to ""blue.""

Given the inconsistency in how the word ""zup"" is translated in the two identical examples (1 and 5), and based on the evidence provided, a new rule for ""bluf"" is more likely that it is consistently represented by ""red red"" without considering the number of letters in the preceding word:

Rule: bluf -> red red
According to the given examples, we observe the following:

Input: zup lug walm → Output: yellow blue blue blue
Input: dax walm zup lug dax → Output: green green green yellow blue green
Input: dax zup walm wif walm → Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
Input: zup walm → Output: yellow yellow yellow
Input: dax walm → Output: green green green

In each of these examples, walm seems to result in the repetition of the color word that immediately follows its first appearance. For instance:

- In ""zup lug walm,"" walm comes after ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, and the output is blue repeated three times.
- In ""dax walm zup lug dax,"" walm follows ""dax,"" representing green, and we see green repeated three times immediately after.
- In ""dax zup walm wif walm,"" the first occurrence of walm follows ""zup,"" resulting in three yellow outputs. The second walm comes after ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, leading to three red outputs.
- In the cases of ""zup walm"" and ""dax walm,"" walm simply repeats the color that corresponds with the preceding word three times: yellow and green, respectively.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Walm -> When following a color word, repeat that color word output three times.

Rule: walm causes the color immediately following it to be repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif zup bluf
    ",Output: green red yellow red red,green red yellow yellow,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce a pattern:

- Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output.
- When combined with other words like ""dax"", ""zup"", ""wif"", and so on, each of these has its own consistent output color given in the examples such as ""dax"" -> green, ""zup"" -> yellow, ""wif"" -> red, but ""lug"" constantly maps to ""blue"".

Considering this pattern from all the given inputs and outputs, the rule can be stated simply:

Rule: lug means blue.
Based on the examples provided, where ""dax"" is present in the input and ""green"" appears in the corresponding output, it seems that the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" is associated with a particular color each time it appears. By looking at each example, it consistently translates to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow. Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to examine each example and look for patterns:

Example 1:
Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red

Example 2:
Input: dax bluf
Output: green green

Example 3:
Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
Output: blue red blue green green

Example 4:
Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red

Example 5:
Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green

The word ""bluf"" appears in different contexts, but in every instance, it produces a repetition in the output. Specifically, ""bluf"" causes the previous color to be repeated once. For instance:

- In Example 1, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and is followed by ""bluf,"" leading to another ""red"" in the output.
- In Example 2, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and when followed by ""bluf,"" there is a second ""green"" in the output.

Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color that was just mentioned in the output. The rule would be that whenever ""bluf"" is encountered, repeat the previous color in the output string.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the previous color in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the word ""walm"" seems to correlate with repeating the color that corresponds to the word that immediately precedes it three times. Let's examine each example:

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
Explanation: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and following ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
Explanation: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and following ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green.""

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue
Explanation: ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""lug"" corresponds to blue. After ""walm,"" the output repeats the preceding color, which is red, three times before concluding with the color for ""lug.""

Input: lug walm zup lug walm
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
Explanation: ""lug"" corresponds to blue, which is repeated three times after the first ""walm."" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and is followed by another ""lug"" (blue). The second ""walm"" results in repeating the color for ""lug,"" blue, three more times.

Input: zup wif lug zup walm
Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
Explanation: The pattern holds as the last word before ""walm"" is ""zup,"" corresponding to yellow, which is then repeated three times after ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug bluf dax
    ",Output: blue blue green,blue blue green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" is translated as the color ""blue"".
Based on the provided examples, we can observe that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. No other word in the inputs triggers the output ""green,"" and ""dax"" never results in a different output color. Therefore, the rule can be inferred as follows:

Rule: dax -> green. 

This means that the nonce word ""dax"" is equivalent to the color ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red when preceded by ""wif,"" corresponds to the color green when preceded by ""dax,"" and corresponds to the color blue when preceded by ""lug."" When ""bluf"" appears without one of these specific preceding words, it repeats the color of the word before it. Here are the observations:

- When ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" the output is ""red red.""
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"" the output is ""green green.""
- When ""lug"" is followed by ""bluf"" the output is ""blue blue.""
- In the absence of a specific preceding word (example 4), ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word before it (""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"").

Rule: bluf -> follows the color of the preceding key word (""wif"" for red, ""dax"" for green, ""lug"" for blue) or repeats the color of the word before it if there is no key word directly before ""bluf.""
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look at the relationship between the input and output in each example.

Analyzing the first example: 
- Input: dax walm
- Output: green green green

The word ""dax"" appears to correspond to the color ""green,"" and we see ""green"" repeated three times. The repetition suggests that ""walm"" might also mean ""green"" or that it carries the action of tripling the preceding color.

Considering the second example:
- Input: dax walm wif walm
- Output: green green green red red red

Here, ""wif"" is introduced and corresponds to ""red."" The pattern of tripling continues with ""wif"" being followed by ""walm,"" resulting in ""red"" being repeated three times.

Examining the third example:
- Input: lug zup walm lug
- Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

We see a new word, ""lug,"" corresponding to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" Importantly, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and results in ""yellow"" being repeated three times, similar to the previous examples. However, ""lug"" at the end of the input doesn't get tripled, implying that ""walm"" must precede a color word to have the effect of tripling it.

Looking at the fourth example:
- Input: zup walm
- Output: yellow yellow yellow

Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the effect of ""walm"" tripling the color word is consistent.

Regarding the fifth example:
- Input: wif walm dax zup
- Output: red red red green yellow

Here, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and the tripling effect is observed for ""red."" The word ""dax"" follows and corresponds to ""green,"" but since it is not directly followed by ""walm,"" it doesn't get tripled. ""Zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and also doesn't get tripled, again supporting the specific rule about ""walm.""

Based on the examples provided, we can determine the rule for ""walm"" to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color word, it causes that color word to be outputted three times. If ""walm"" does not directly follow a color word, then it has no effect on the output.

Therefore: walm -> causes the preceding color word to be output three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, it appears that each word is associated with a specific color. The word 'dax' consistently translates to the color 'green' in the output, irrespective of its position in the input sequence. For the other words, 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', 'bluf' to 'green', 'wif' to 'red', and 'zup' to 'yellow'. 'Walm' also corresponds to 'yellow', as seen in the fourth example.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. Here are the apparent mappings:

- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- walm -> red (by inference from the last example)

When the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the output consistently includes the color red. Furthermore, examining the first and last examples, it is apparent that the presence of ""wif"" can result in multiple instances of the color red in the output.

Thus, the nonce word ""wif"" appears to correspond to the color red, with the number of occurrences of red in the output being dependent on the surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red, with the number of reds possibly being influenced by context or the position of ""wif"" in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following:

- Every time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears an equivalent number of times in the output.
- This observation holds true regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence or the presence of other words alongside it. 

Thus, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow"" (The word ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output.)
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" when followed by ""zup"" and ""red"" when followed by ""wif."" However, there is no example with ""bluf"" alone or followed by any other word to conclude its translation independently.

Here are the rules I can deduce:
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it translates to ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it translates to ""red.""
- The word ""bluf"" does not seem to alter the translation of other words following it, as ""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and ""walm"" consistently translate to ""yellow,"" ""red,"" ""blue,"" ""green,"" and ""red"" respectively, regardless of their position in relation to ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup,"" ""red"" when preceded by ""wif.""
From the examples provided, we can deduce the rule for the nonce word walm. 

In each Output:

- The word immediately preceding walm seems to determine the color that will be repeated after walm.
- The number of repetitions of that color seems consistent with the number of syllables in the preceding word.

Let's analyze:

1. In ""zup wif dax walm"", ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is a single ""green"" followed by two more ""green."" ""Dax"" is one syllable, but ""walm"" leads to it being said three times in total.

2. In ""zup walm"", ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""yellow"" said three times. ""Zup"" is also one syllable, and ""walm"" leads to it being said three times in total, suggesting a base count.

3. In ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"", the pattern continues: ""wif"" precedes the first ""walm"" and ""red"" is said three times; ""lug"" precedes the second ""walm"" and ""blue"" is said three times. ""Wif"" is one syllable, ""lug"" is also one syllable, and again, ""walm"" causes each to be said three times.

4. In ""wif walm dax"", ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and ""red"" is said three times (like the previous examples).

5. In ""lug dax walm"", ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and ""green"" is said three times.

So, the pattern suggests that the word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times regardless of the number of syllables in that preceding word (which has been consistently one syllable in these examples).

Rule:
walm -> A rule that causes the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"" to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, each example shows a correspondence between the input and the output. We need to identify what ""dax"" consistently corresponds to in the outputs.

Let's break down each example:

1. Input: wif lug dax, Output: red blue green
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

2. Input: zup bluf dax, Output: yellow yellow green
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

3. Input: zup dax wif, Output: yellow green red
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

4. Input: dax walm zup walm, Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

5. Input: zup lug dax, Output: yellow blue green
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

In all the given examples, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: dax -> green. In each instance, regardless of the context or the position of the word in the input, ""dax"" always equates to ""green"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" seems to be associated with the color ""red"". However, the number of times ""red"" appears in the output seems to be dependent on the presence and position of other words. Let's look at the examples in more detail:

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm -> Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
Here, ""wif"" is followed by three different words, and the output starts with ""red"".

Input: wif zup -> Output: red yellow
Here, ""wif"" is followed by one different word, and the output starts with ""red"".

Input: wif lug walm -> Output: red blue blue blue
Here, ""wif"" is followed by two instances of the same word, and the output starts with ""red"".

Input: wif walm -> Output: red red red
Here, ""wif"" is followed by just one word which is repeated three times in the output.

Input: zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red
Here, ""wif"" comes after ""zup"" and is followed by one word which triples in the output. 

So far, we can see that ""wif"" is consistently associated with the color ""red"". Additionally, it appears that when ""wif"" is followed by a single word, the color associated with that word repeats in the output, increasing in count from the point ""wif"" appears.

Thus, the rule could be:
Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"", and when followed by another word, it causes the output for the color corresponding to the following word to repeat based on the number of times ""wif"" and the subsequent word appear consecutively.

wif -> red (causes the following word's color to repeat in the output)
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" can be deduced as follows:

- Whenever ""zup"" appears alone, the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""zup"" is combined with other words, it contributes ""yellow"" to the output sequence, with the position of ""yellow"" in the sequence corresponding to the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence.

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" seems to be:

zup -> yellow

This means that ""zup"" represents the color ""yellow."" Regardless of the other words present in the input, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color output ""green"" whenever ""dax"" appears earlier in the sequence, and ""red"" when it doesn't.

Let's analyze each input-output pair for confirmation:

1. Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
   Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow
   - ""dax"" is present earlier, and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"".

2. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   - ""dax"" is not present, and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".

3. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue red green green red
   - ""dax"" is present earlier, and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"".

4. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   - ""dax"" is present earlier, and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
   - Note: There seems to be an inconsistency here since we expected ""bluf"" to correspond to ""green"". We might need to re-evaluate this after looking at more examples.

5. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   - ""dax"" is not present, and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".

Considering the information above and the inconsistency found in example four, a possible rule for ""bluf"" that coincides with most examples except potentially one (which may be an error) is that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" if preceded by ""dax"" in any earlier position and ""red"" if ""dax"" is not present earlier in the sequence. 

However, relying on this interpretation suggests that there may be an error in the fourth pair's output. If there is no error, then the rule may require additional context or conditional information not provided in the examples. Pending clarification or more examples, the rule might tentatively be defined as:

Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" if ""dax"" is earlier in the sequence, and ""red"" otherwise, with the recognition that there may be an exception or additional conditions affecting the rule for the sequence in example four.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's observe the patterns where the word ""walm"" appears and the corresponding output colors:

1. Input: dax walm wif dax
   Output: green green green red green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" every time it appears.
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" when it appears after ""dax"" and before ""walm.""

2. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" every time it appears.
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" in its single appearance.
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" when it appears after a color word (i.e., ""lug"").

3. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   - ""lug"" and ""dax"" correlate with ""blue"" and ""green"" respectively.

4. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"" and ""dax"" with ""green.""

5. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" and ""dax"" with ""green.""

Analyzing the information above, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it. For every instance of ""walm,"" the output is a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word just before ""walm."" Here's how it applies:

1. ""dax walm wif dax"" -> ""green green green red green"" (green repeated because of ""dax"")
2. ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" -> ""blue blue red blue red red red blue"" (red repeated because of ""wif"")
3. ""lug walm dax"" -> ""blue blue blue green"" (blue repeated because of ""lug"")
4. ""dax lug dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue green blue blue blue"" (blue repeated because of ""lug"")
5. ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green"" (yellow repeated because of ""zup"")

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow,yellow yellow yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, here's the induction for the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"":

Input: lug
Output: blue

Input: zup lug
Output: yellow blue

Input: dax walm zup lug
Output: green green green yellow blue

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: lug dax zup
Output: blue green yellow

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue."" The other words preceding or following ""lug"" seem to correspond to different colors: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" shows redundancy encoding (it appears next to ""lug"" and translates to the same color as ""lug"").

So the rule for ""lug"" is:

lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the input contains ""wif,"" the output includes ""red"" corresponding to each occurrence of ""wif.""
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" corresponds with the color ""yellow"". Every input that contains ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" being part of the output sequence. Other words in the examples are consistently associated with their own colors as well (""dax"" with green, ""lug"" with blue).

Here is the association based on the inputs and outputs provided:

- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- ""dax"" -> ""green""
- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- ""wif"" has only been used once, in combination with ""zup dax"", and the output was ""red""; however, with the information provided we cannot fully determine the color association for ""wif"" as ""red"" might be due to the combination of ""zup"" and ""dax"".

Thus, the rule appears to be that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the words around it.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"", we should compare the inputs and outputs to understand the translation mechanism.

Examples:

1. Input: zup wif bluf zup
   Output: yellow red red yellow

2. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red

3. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow

4. Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red

5. Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
   Output: green green red blue yellow

Analyzing the examples:

- When ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"" (Examples 1 and 3), the output is a repetition of the color that corresponds to ""zup"" (yellow).
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (Example 4), the output is the color corresponding to ""lug"" (blue) repeated once.
- In Example 2, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and is followed by nothing, and the output is double ""red"".
- In Example 5, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""wif"", the corresponding output is the color for ""dax"" (green) repeated twice and then ""red"".

From this analysis, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it, or if followed by ""wif"" without a preceding color word, it outputs ""red"".

Thus,

bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word or output ""red"" if it follows ""wif"" without a preceding color word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's break down each line and look for patterns:

1. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   - The pattern red, red, green, green, red, red occurs before ""walm,"" suggesting that ""walm"" is not directly related to the sequence so far. After ""walm,"" the colors red, blue, red appear.
   - ""lug wif"" is translated to ""blue red"" after ""walm,"" which usually translates to ""blue red"" without ""walm"" present.

2. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   - ""wif lug"" is translated to ""red blue,"" and after ""walm,"" we see ""blue blue.""

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" is translated to ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" we see ""green green.""

4. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
   - ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" the sequence is ""yellow yellow green blue.""

5. Input: zup dax walm
   Output: yellow green green green
   - Before ""walm,"" ""zup dax"" corresponds to ""yellow green,"" and after ""walm,"" we get ""green green.""

Looking at the patterns:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears, the color right after ""walm"" is the same color that appeared directly before ""walm.""
- This repeating of color continues for an unspecified number of times—however, never less than twice.
- The pattern breaks once a new color word (""lug,"" ""dax,"" or a new entity not preceded by ""walm"") is introduced.

Rule: walm -> a repeater of the color word mentioned just before it for at least two or more occurrences until a new color word is introduced.

Examples:
- In ""wif lug walm,"" ""walm"" repeats the color ""blue"" from ""lug"" two more times.
- ""dax walm"" becomes ""green green green"" making ""walm"" repeat the color ""green"" from ""dax"" two more times.
- ""zup walm dax lug"" makes ""walm"" repeat ""yellow"" from ""zup"" two times before moving on to the colors specified by ""dax"" and ""lug.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug
    ",Output: green blue,green blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> ""blue""
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems straightforward:

- Each unique word in the input corresponds to a unique color in the output.
- The word ""lug"" always corresponds to the color blue.
- The word ""bluf"" always corresponds to the color green.
- The word ""zup"" always corresponds to the color yellow.
- The word ""wif"" always corresponds to the color red.
- The new word ""dax"" has been consistently translated to the color green.

However, there is a contradiction with the provided examples:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to blue, while in all other examples, ""bluf"" corresponds to green.
- The nonce word ""dax"" is consistently translated as green except in the second example where it comes after ""lug,"" and it is translated to green again, despite the rule that a word shouldn't change its corresponding color.

Given this information contradiction, without further clarification or additional examples, it's challenging to determine whether the inconsistency is a mistake or if there's an additional rule not immediately apparent from the examples. Assuming that the instances of ""bluf"" translating to blue and ""dax"" translating to green after ""lug"" are errors, the rule can be defined as:
  
dax -> green

But if we assume there might be a hidden rule, more information is required to determine it. For now, with the information given and assuming the second ""bluf"" in the first example is an error, we can state:

Rule: dax -> green
Analyzing the given input-output pairs, we can see that the output color does not directly relate to individual words such as ""zup,"" ""dax,"" or ""walm."" Instead, it relates to their position or sequence. However, every time the word ""wif"" appears, the output consistently is ""red."" No other input word consistently corresponds to the same color output. This suggests that ""wif"" is directly linked to the color ""red,"" independent of its position in the sequence. Other words must have rules dependent on either their position in the sequence or the combination with other words.

Therefore, the rule deduced is:

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of context.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" appears to simply repeat the color associated with the word that comes before it. 

- In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, so ""bluf"" following ""zup"" also corresponds to yellow.
- In the third example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""bluf"" after it also corresponds to blue.
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" making ""bluf"" mean yellow again, and when ""lug"" follows ""bluf,"" ""lug"" has its own color, which is blue.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" so ""bluf"" here means green.

bluf -> the same color as the word before it.
Based on the provided examples, it seems like the nonce word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the output color that directly precedes it, with the number of repetitions in the output corresponding to the number of repetitions of the word ""walm"" plus one. The first instance of any color before ""walm"" will determine the color to repeat.

Let's observe the patterns:

In the first example:
Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Here ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and after ""walm"" the word yellow is repeated twice which is ""number of walms + 1"".

In the second example:
Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

Here ""wif"" corresponds to red, and after ""walm"" the word red is repeated twice which is ""number of walms + 1"".

In the third example:
Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red

The pattern holds as ""wif"" corresponds to red and after ""walm"" we see red repeated twice which is ""number of walms + 1"".

In the fourth example:
Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow

In this case, ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""walm"" repeats the green once (as ""number of walms + 1""), followed by ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow.

In the fifth example:
Input: dax walm wif zup
Output: green green green red yellow

Here ""dax"" corresponds to green and is repeated twice after ""walm"". Then ""wif"" corresponds to red and is followed by ""zup"" that corresponds to yellow.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color word preceding it in the output, the number of repeats being equal to the number of times ""walm"" appears plus one.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color in the output, ""number of walms + 1"" times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that 'dax' corresponds to the color 'green'. Each time the nonce word 'dax' appears in the input, the word 'green' appears in the output.

Examining each example:

- Input: wif dax lug dax | Output: red green blue green
- Input: wif zup walm dax zup | Output: red yellow yellow green yellow
- Input: wif bluf dax | Output: red red green
- Input: wif walm dax zup | Output: red red red green yellow
- Input: lug dax lug | Output: blue green blue

In every instance, 'dax' corresponds directly to 'green', suggesting this word or rule.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red"" in the outputs. Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output:

- Input: wif lug | Output: red blue (wif corresponds to red)
- Input: zup wif lug | Output: yellow red blue (wif corresponds to red)
- Input: wif | Output: red (wif corresponds to red)
- Input: zup dax walm zup wif | Output: yellow green green green yellow red (wif corresponds to red)
- Input: wif bluf lug zup | Output: red red blue yellow (wif corresponds to red)

Thus, the rule seems to be: wif -> red. 
Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" is included in the output at the corresponding position for ""wif"".
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word 'zup' translates to the color 'yellow', regardless of its position in the sequence.
Rule: bluf -> red
walm -> repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the output is the color correlating with the initial word repeated three times. For ""dax,"" the associated color is green, and for ""zup,"" it is yellow.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue in all provided examples.
Based on the given examples, one can infer that each word corresponds to a color. The word 'dax' consistently corresponds to 'green,' regardless of its position in the sequence. The other words ('zup', 'bluf', 'lug', 'wif') seem to correspond to 'yellow', 'green', 'blue', and 'red' respectively based on their consistent translation across different inputs.

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. Every occurrence of ""wif"" in the input is translated to ""red"" in the output.
zup -> yellow. Rule: When the word 'zup' appears in the input, it translates to the word ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we observe the following pattern for the appearance of colors relative to certain words:

- 'lug' consistently outputs 'blue'
- 'wif' consistently outputs 'red'
- 'dax' consistently outputs 'green'
- 'zup' and 'walm' consistently output 'yellow'

The word 'bluf' appears in conjunction with these colors, indicating a probable relation to color. However, the examples also show that when 'bluf' is used, it repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it:

- Example 1: lug (blue) bluf -> blue blue
- Example 2: wif (red) bluf -> red red
- Example 3: wif (red) bluf -> red red
- Example 4: lug (blue) bluf wif (red) -> blue blue red
- Example 5: wif (red) bluf -> red red

Hence, the rule appears to be that 'bluf' duplicates the color word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning: 'bluf' duplicates the color word that immediately precedes it.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the commonalities and differences in the provided examples:

1. Input: lug dax walm wif | Output: blue green green green red
2. Input: zup wif dax walm | Output: yellow red green green green
3. Input: dax wif walm | Output: green red red red
4. Input: zup walm lug wif | Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
5. Input: dax walm wif | Output: green green green red

Let's focus on the position of ""walm"" and the corresponding output color:

- In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" and the output is ""green green.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" is at the end, with ""dax"" before it, and the output is ""green green green.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" is at the end again, and the output is ""red red.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" and the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" and the output is ""green green.""

It appears that ""walm"" affects the output based on the word that follows it. When ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" the immediate output is ""green green."" When ""lug"" follows ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow."" However, when ""walm"" is at the end or followed by ""dax,"" there's a red in the output.

Considering these observations, ""walm"" could be a rule indicating a type of repeater or duplicator for the subsequent word's output color, with an exception when ""dax"" is nearby, which seems to trigger a green or red output.

Rule: When ""walm"" precedes a word, the corresponding color output of that word is repeated once. When ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" or is at the end of the input, the colors green or red appear, but additional examples would be necessary to determine the exact pattern in these cases.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug
    ",Output: green blue,green blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present. Therefore:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color green in every example provided.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" appears to consistently correspond to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, ""yellow"" is found in the exact same position in the output. The contexts in which ""zup"" appears vary, but the corresponding output is consistently ""yellow,"" regardless of the other terms presented around it. 

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns in the given inputs and outputs. 

In all examples, the presence of ""bluf"" results in a double occurrence of the color associated with the word preceding it:

- In the first example, ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"" and the output for ""dax"" is green. The output for ""bluf"" is also green.
- In the second example, ""lug"" comes before ""bluf"" and the output for ""lug"" is blue. The output for ""bluf"" is again blue.
- The third example is a repetition of the second example's pattern with ""lug"" followed by ""bluf"" resulting in blue blue.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output for both is red.
- Finally, the fifth example repeats the pattern of the fourth where ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and both have the output red.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated.

Rule: bluf -> causes the same color as the preceding word to be repeated.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the examples provided, let's look at the patterns in the given inputs and their corresponding outputs.

1. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

3. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

5. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red

From the examples provided, ""walm"" appears to repeat the color associated with the word preceding it. It also seems that each unique word has a specific color associated with it:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

Now, let's analyze it closely:

- In examples 1 and 5, ""lug"" and ""wif"" both precede ""walm"" and cause a repetition of ""blue"" and ""red,"" respectively, for the number of times ""walm"" appears.
- In example 2, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and is followed by three ""green"" words, indicating a repetition.
- In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""dax,"" and there are three ""red"" before a ""green.""
- Lastly, in example 4, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" again and results in three ""red.""

Given these observations, here is the rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color of the preceding word for as many times as ""walm"" appears.

In conclusion:
walm -> Repeats the color of the last word immediately before it for the number of times ""walm"" occurs in a sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup dax
    ",Output: red yellow green,red yellow green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Lug -> blue

Rule: The word 'lug' directly translates to the color 'blue' in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or pattern associated with the word ""wif.""

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow
- Here, ""wif"" is followed by ""zup,"" which doesn't occur in the other examples except as the output. The presence of ""wif"" leads to ""red"" being the first color in the output.

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue
- Again, ""wif"" precedes another word (""lug"") and results in ""red"" being the first color in the output.

Input: dax wif
Output: green red
- This time, ""wif"" is preceded by ""dax,"" which results in ""red"" being the second color in the output. It might suggest that ""wif"" contributes to the output ""red"" when it is used in a sequence.

Input: wif
Output: red
- When ""wif"" is alone, the output is ""red."" This reinforces the pattern that ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red,"" regardless of what precedes or follows it.

Input: lug wif lug
Output: blue red blue
- When ""wif"" is surrounded by ""lug,"" it results in ""red"" being the middle color. The symmetry in input and output suggests that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" while ""wif"" remains consistent with ""red.""

Based on the patterns observed, the rule we can induce is that the presence of ""wif"" in any sequence directly contributes to the output ""red,"" regardless of its position.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Every output associated with an input containing ""zup"" consistently starts with the color ""yellow."" Depending on the context of the input, zup might signify the color yellow exclusively, or it might have a property that prompts the repetition of the previous color in the output sequence. However, since ""zup"" alone produces the output ""yellow,"" the most straightforward rule is that ""zup"" corresponds to this color.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> red

Rule: When bluf is placed after another word, it takes the color meaning of the preceding word. Since ""wif"" means red and ""zup"" means yellow, when ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" or ""zup"", it takes their color meaning respectively.
walm -> repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it. 

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the output is the color associated with that preceding word repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue in the output, consistently across all examples.
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" I will analyze the inputs and their corresponding outputs, considering the position of the noun ""dax"" and the changes in the outputs that occur in its presence.

Input: dax wif
Output: green red

Input: dax bluf lug wif
Output: green green blue red

Input: wif dax
Output: red green

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

From the examples, we can observe the following:
1. Whenever ""dax"" is present, the first color in the output is always ""green.""
2. The word ""dax"" itself does not seem to be associated with a single fixed color; instead, its position in the input determines the initial output color.
3. The colors that follow ""green"" in the outputs seem to correspond to the other words in the input (e.g., ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""walm"" to ""green"").

Given these observations, we can infer a rule for the meaning of ""dax"": 

Rule: The word ""dax"" indicates that the first color in the output should be ""green,"" with the subsequent colors determined by the other input words.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's analyze the input and corresponding output patterns:

Input: dax wif
Output: green red
Rule: ""dax"" -> green, ""wif"" -> red

Input: dax zup wif
Output: green yellow red
Rule: ""dax"" -> green, ""zup"" -> yellow, ""wif"" -> red

Input: zup lug walm wif dax
Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
Rule: ""zup"" -> yellow, ""lug"" -> blue, ""walm"" -> blue, ""wif"" -> red, ""dax"" -> green

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red
Rule: ""zup"" -> yellow, ""wif"" -> red

Input: zup bluf wif
Output: yellow yellow red
Rule: ""zup"" -> yellow, ""bluf"" -> yellow, ""wif"" -> red

From these examples, we can see that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sentence or the words that come before or after it. Now let's formalize the rule:

wif -> red
Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
Based on the provided examples, we notice that the word ""bluf"" is associated with a repeated color in the output. The rule seems to be that ""bluf"" represents a repetition of the color associated with the directly preceding word. Let's examine each example:

1. Input: ""zup wif bluf"" 
   Output: ""yellow red red""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" resulting in a second ""red"".

2. Input: ""dax bluf""
   Output: ""green green""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" leading to another ""green"".

3. Input: ""wif bluf dax""
   Output: ""red red green""
   - Here, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" (which is ""red""), thus it's another ""red"". ""dax"" then corresponds to ""green"".

4. Input: ""wif zup dax bluf""
   Output: ""red yellow green green""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", which means it repeats the ""green"".

5. Input: ""wif walm lug bluf""
   Output: ""red red red blue blue""
   - ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"", which is associated with ""blue"", hence it is repeated.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color corresponding to the word directly before it.
walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule:

Based on the examples given, it seems that ""walm"" is a repeat operation that replicates the color associated with the previous word a number of times. The number of repetitions seems to be three. 

Here's a breakdown for each example:

1. ""wif lug dax walm"" results in ""red blue green green green"". After ""wif"" we get ""red"", after ""lug"" we get ""blue"", after ""dax"" we get ""green"", and then after ""walm"" the color ""green"" associated with ""dax"" is repeated three times.
   
2. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"". Here, ""dax"" corresponds with ""green"", and then ""walm"" replicates it three times.

3. ""dax zup dax walm"" results in ""green yellow green green green"". ""dax"" is ""green"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""dax"" again is ""green"", and ""walm"" results in the last color ""green"" being repeated three times.

4. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"". ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""walm"" repeats it three times.

5. ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"". ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""walm"" repeats it three times.

So the rule for ""walm"" can be stated as: walm duplicates the color represented by the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the examples, the word ""lug"" consistently maps to the color ""blue"".

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
By analyzing the patterns in which the nonce word ""wif"" appears and the corresponding outputs, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule associated with ""wif"".

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue
- Here, ""wif"" is followed by the outputs ""red red"".

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue
- Here, ""wif"" is followed by ""red"".

Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
- In this case, ""wif"" stands alone at the end and corresponds to ""red"".

Input: lug zup dax wif
Output: blue yellow green red
- Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" once more.

From these examples, it seems that regardless of its position in the sequence or the words that come before or after it, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red.
From the given examples, it seems that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" Here is how the rule applies to each example:

Input: lug zup dax wif

Rule: Again, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
Rule: Here ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and it appears that ""walm"" also corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
Rule: ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""walm"" is ""red,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" followed by two more instances of ""yellow"" for ""walm.""

Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
Rule: ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""bluf"" is ""blue,"" followed by another ""yellow"" for ""zup,"" ""blue"" for ""bluf,"" and ""red"" for ""wif.""

Based on these patterns, we can deduce that the word ""zup"" means ""yellow.""

So the rule is: zup -> yellow.
bluf -> red. 

Rule: The word ""bluf"" in the context provided results in the output ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm"" in the given context, we need to carefully analyze the patterns between the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Let's break down the examples one by one to look for any rules or consistencies:

1. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow
   - Each ""dax"" maps to ""green"".
   - Each ""wif"" maps to ""red"".
   - The ""lug"" following ""walm"" is ""red"".
   - Each ""lug"" not following ""walm"" is ""blue"".
   - Each ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"".

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - Both ""lug"" and ""walm"" map to ""blue"".

3. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   - The ""lug"" before ""walm"" is ""blue"".
   - ""Walm"" and the ""dax"" following ""walm"" are ""blue"".

4. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   - ""Wif"" is ""red"", ""dax"" is ""green"", the ""lug"" before ""walm"" is ""blue"", and the ""walm"" itself and ""lug"" following ""walm"" is ""blue"".

5. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow
   - ""Dax"" is ""green"", and once ""walm"" appears, the following ""wif"" is ""green"" instead of its usual ""red"".

From the patterns observed, ""walm"" appears to change the usual output color of the following word to the output color of the word directly preceding ""walm"". 

Let's apply this observation:

- In example 1, the ""lug"" after ""walm"" turns to ""red"", which is the color for ""wif"", the word right before ""walm"".
- In example 2, ""walm"" doesn't have a word after it, so it repeats the color of ""lug"" which is blue.
- In example 3, both the word ""walm"" and the word after ""walm"" (""dax"") are ""blue"", which corresponds to the color for ""lug"".
- In example 4, ""walm"" and the subsequent ""lug"" turn to ""blue"", which corresponds to ""lug"" that comes before ""walm"".
- In example 5, ""wif"" after ""walm"" turns to ""green"", which is the color for ""dax"".

Rule: walm -> causes the subsequent word to take on the output color of the word directly before ""walm"". If there is no word after ""walm"", then ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the output:

- In every instance where ""lug"" appears, a ""blue"" appears in the output.
- Regardless of the word that follows ""lug"" (e.g., ""walm,"" ""wif,"" ""zup""), ""lug"" results in ""blue.""
- ""Lug"" does not appear to affect the translation of the words that come after it since those words translate into colors independently (e.g., ""walm"" -> blue blue blue, ""wif"" -> red, ""zup"" -> yellow).

Therefore, the rule is:
Rule: lug -> blue
Considering the inputs and their corresponding outputs, the rule seems to be as follows:

Each nonce word (dax, zup, wif, bluf) corresponds to a specific color:
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- bluf -> green

However, ""bluf"" and ""dax"" both output green, yet it is implied that ""dax"" specifically means green, and no other word seems to vary in its output.

Thus, the rule could be:
dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each nonce word has a corresponding color.

Observing the examples:

- In example 1, we see ""dax wif bluf dax"" translated to ""green red red green"". Given that the non-wif words ""dax"" and ""bluf"" keep their colors consistent in other examples (""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""), we can deduce that ""wif"" also corresponds to ""red"".
  
- In example 2, ""wif walm zup walm"" is translated to ""red red red yellow yellow yellow"". Here, the presence of ""wif"" preceding other words does not change the output color of those words. This means that ""wif"" has an individual color and does not alter the colors of the words that come after it, reinforcing that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

- The third example also supports the notion that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", as ""lug"" is consistently ""blue"", and ""dax"" is consistently ""green"".

- The fourth example, ""wif bluf dax"", is translated to ""red red green"". Since we already established ""bluf"" means ""red"" and ""dax"" means ""green"", this further confirms the color for ""wif"" as ""red"".
  
- Lastly, the fifth example shows ""wif"" alone outputting ""red"", supporting all the previous observations.

Thus, the rule is:

wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, the meaning of 'zup' is consistent across all contexts. Regardless of position or surrounding words, 'zup' always yields the same output. Here is the deduction:

Input: wif walm dax zup - Output: red red red green yellow
Input: dax bluf wif zup wif - Output: green green red yellow red
Input: zup bluf - Output: yellow yellow
Input: lug zup - Output: blue yellow
Input: zup - Output: yellow

In every instance, the word 'zup' corresponds to the output 'yellow'. Therefore, the rule I can infer is:

zup -> meaning. Rule: 'zup' always translates to the color 'yellow'.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to generate a sequence of color words in the output. The output sequence corresponds to the preceding words in some manner. We will consider each example and look for patterns:

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" and ""walm"" does not seem to appear elsewhere. However, after ""bluf,"" the color ""red"" is repeated three times, which matches the number of words after ""bluf.""

2. Input: wif bluf lug
   Output: red red blue
   ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" and ""lug"" does not appear in other examples to compare. Notably, ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue,"" which seems out of sequence given other color assignments.

3. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow red green red red
   Here ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and after ""bluf,"" ""red"" appears twice, matching the number of times ""wif"" is said before ""bluf.""

4. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
   Output: green red green yellow yellow
   Here ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" After ""bluf,"" ""yellow"" is repeated twice, corresponding to the single ""zup"" before ""bluf.""

5. Input: zup dax bluf zup dax
   Output: yellow green green yellow green
   In this example, ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and after ""bluf,"" the sequence is one ""yellow"" and one ""green"" without any repetition.

Considering these examples, ""bluf"" seems to induce a repetition in the output sequence. However, the rule for the type of repetition or color sequence is inconsistent when looking at examples 2 and 5. Without additional data, it's difficult to ascertain a definitive rule for ""bluf."" 

Given the inconsistent patterns following the use of ""bluf,"" the best determination I can offer from these examples is:

bluf -> rule: Causes a repetition or pattern change in the sequence of colors in the output, but the specific rule governing this change is not clear from the provided data.

Additional examples, where the word ""bluf"" is used in a consistent and predictable manner, would be necessary to accurately determine a rule.
Considering the provided examples, we can notice that the output colors are associated with specific input words. Specifically, the word ""walm"" consistently leads to a sequence of ""yellow"" followed by ""red."" Importantly, the number of ""yellow"" outputs before the ""red"" output seems to be equal to the number of words preceding ""walm"" in each input.

For instance:
- Input: dax zup walm wif -> Output: green yellow yellow yellow red (three words before ""walm"" result in three yellows)
- Input: zup walm wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow red (two words before ""walm"" result in two yellows)
- Input: wif walm -> Output: red red red (one word before ""walm"" results in one yellow)

From these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" corresponds to a rule where ""walm"" causes a number of ""yellow"" outputs equivalent to the count of preceding words, followed by a single ""red.""

Rule: walm -> For each word preceding ""walm,"" output ""yellow,"" after the last word before ""walm,"" output ""red"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug zup
    ",Output: green blue yellow,green blue yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue."" This can be inferred from its standalone use where ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue"" and when it is used in combination with other words, such as ""dax lug"" resulting in ""green blue"" each time, showing that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" 

Here is the induction based on the examples:

- Input: dax lug / Output: green blue -> ""dax"" is green and ""lug"" is blue
- Input: lug bluf / Output: blue blue -> ""lug"" is blue and ""bluf"" is redundant or also means blue
- Input: lug dax wif lug / Output: blue green red blue -> ""lug"" is the first and last blue, ""dax"" is green, and ""wif"" is red
- Input: zup bluf wif lug dax / Output: yellow yellow red blue green -> ""zup"" is yellow, ""wif"" is red, ""lug"" is blue, and ""dax"" is green; ""bluf"" was previously thought to mean blue or be redundant, but since it is followed by ""wif"" and outputs ""yellow red,"" ""bluf"" likely means ""yellow"" here or is context-dependent

Taking all the examples into consideration, the most consistent meaning for ""lug"" is ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of the word ""dax,"" we need to analyze the position and context of the word in each input and the corresponding output.

Looking at the examples:

Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Here ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" Since ""dax"" is the only other word, it must correspond to ""green.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

""Dax"" appears again, and the corresponding output starts with ""green."" ""Walm"" doesn't appear in other examples, but since the output is ""green green green,"" and there are no clues about how ""walm"" may modify the meaning, we can infer that ""walm"" could correspond to ""green"" as well, or that ""dax"" could mean repetitive ""green.""

Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
Output: green yellow red red blue

Here ""dax"" must correspond to ""green"" at the beginning. ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" as seen in the ""wif dax"" example, and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" consistent with the first example. ""Zup"" hasn't appeared before but corresponds to ""yellow"" here. ""Bluf"" is similar to ""blue,"" but since it corresponds to ""red"" in the output, it's a different word. The presence of two ""reds"" in the output suggests that ""bluf"" could also mean ""red,"" making the output ""green yellow red red blue.""

Input: wif dax
Output: red green

Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Considering all examples, it appears that ""dax"" maintains the same meaning across all contexts, and there's no evidence that it modifies or is modified by the word it follows or precedes.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" The other words, ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" and ""walm,"" correspond to other colors, though their meanings are not directly requested. But we could infer that ""dax"" is green, ""zup"" is yellow, ""lug"" is blue, and ""bluf"" is also red (as seen in the example where ""bluf"" produced the output ""red""), and ""walm"" seems to be a sequence of ""green green green.""

Rule:
wif -> red

Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the provided examples, it always shows that the output for ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words. This suggests that ""zup"" translates directly to the color ""yellow.""
bluf -> meaning. Based on the given examples, the meaning of ""bluf"" seems to be ""the color of the word that precedes it."" When ""bluf"" appears after ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue,"" and when it follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow."" Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color indicated by the preceding word and repeats it in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Each instance of ""walm"" results in three repetitions of the preceding color.

Here is the analysis for each provided example:

- For ""dax walm"", ""dax"" correlates to green, and the output is ""green green green"".
- For ""dax wif walm lug zup"", ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and correlates to red, resulting in ""red red red"". Meanwhile, ""lug"" correlates to blue and ""zup"" to yellow.
- For ""dax lug walm"", ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and correlates to blue, resulting in ""blue blue blue"".
- For ""dax walm wif walm"", the first ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), resulting in ""green green green"". The second ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), resulting in ""red red red"".
- For ""lug wif zup wif walm"", the last ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), resulting in ""red red red"".

Rule: **walm -> meaning.** ""Walm"" causes the output to repeat the color of the word that directly precedes it three times.

Thus, the rule is that whenever ""walm"" appears, repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup walm
    ",Output: green yellow yellow yellow,green yellow yellow yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided where ""wif"" is used and the corresponding outputs, I deduce the following rule:

wif -> red

Each time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, a ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. Even when ""wif"" appears alone in the input, the sole output is ""red"". This consistent one-to-one correspondence suggests that the meaning of ""wif"" in this context is simply the color ""red"".

Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position within the input sequence. The other words likely correspond to different colors; for example, ""lug"" may correspond to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" but with the given examples, our primary focus is on the meaning of ""zup,"" which consistently translates to ""yellow.""
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine the examples provided to see if there's a consistent pattern before and after ""bluf."" 

Let's start with the first example:
- Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
- Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow

Whenever ""bluf"" appears, the word before ""bluf"" is repeated in color form after ""bluf."" For instance:
- ""zup"" is translated as ""yellow,"" and after ""bluf,"" ""yellow"" appears.
- ""lug"" is translated as ""blue,"" and after ""bluf,"" ""blue"" appears.

Now, let's confirm this with the rest of the examples provided.

- Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
- Output: green green red yellow red
  ""dax"" is translated as ""green,"" and after ""bluf,"" ""green"" appears.

- Input: wif bluf
- Output: red red
  ""wif"" is translated as ""red,"" and after ""bluf,"" ""red"" appears.

- Input: lug bluf wif
- Output: blue blue red
  ""lug"" is translated as ""blue,"" and after ""bluf,"" ""blue"" appears.

- Input: dax zup bluf
- Output: green yellow yellow
  ""zup"" is translated as ""yellow,"" which appears right after ""bluf.""

Given the consistency across all examples, we can infer that the rule for ""bluf"" is that it predicts that the next color will be the same as the color of the word before ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> the color of the next word is the same as the color of the word that comes before bluf.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" from the given examples, we will analyze the relationship between the Input and the Output strings.

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red
- ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to an additional ""red""

Input: dax walm zup lug walm
Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
- ""dax walm"" corresponds to the initial ""green green green""
- ""zup lug"" corresponds to ""yellow blue""
- ""walm"" at the end corresponds to another ""blue blue blue""

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""walm"" corresponds to additional ""red red""

Input: zup lug walm wif dax
Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
- ""zup lug"" corresponds to ""yellow blue""
- ""walm"" adds two more ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- ""dax walm"" corresponds exclusively to ""green green green""

By reviewing the given examples, we can induce the following rule:

Whenever ""walm"" appears, it adds two instances of the color that immediately precedes it, with ""dax"" being an exception where ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green"", irrespective of the color that would otherwise precede ""walm"".

Based on the above induction, the rule for ""walm"" could be:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color word that comes before it two additional times, except when preceded by ""dax,"" which results in ""green green green.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the term ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""dax.""

In all instances where ""dax"" appears, the corresponding output is ""green."" Therefore, the rule seems to be independent of the position of the word ""dax"" in the sequence, and ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green"" regardless of the words around it.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, where the output is given for each input and the nonce word ""wif"" is included, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the outputs. Here is the correlation:

1. Input: wif zup -> Output: red yellow
   - ""wif"" correlates to ""red"" and ""zup"" probably means ""yellow""

2. Input: dax walm wif -> Output: green green green red
   - ""dax"" and ""walm"" seem to represent ""green."" ""wif"" at the end corresponds to ""red.""

3. Input: wif -> Output: red
   - ""wif"" is the only word and the output is only ""red.""

4. Input: lug wif bluf -> Output: blue red red
   - ""lug"" probably represents ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""bluf"" might be repetition or intensification that leads to the same color being repeated (""red"" in this case).

5. Input: wif dax zup dax -> Output: red green yellow green
   - ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" is ""green"" again.

Rule:
wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
bluf -> meaning. From the given examples, it appears that bluf means to repeat the color that was previously mentioned.

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows another word, it takes on the color meaning of the word that directly precedes it. If that word represents a color, ""bluf"" is an instruction to repeat that color.
Rule: walm -> insert the word ""green"" before the word that follows ""walm"". If the word following ""walm"" is ""dax"", then replace ""dax"" with ""red"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup
    ",Output: blue yellow,blue yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"". Observing each example:

- ""dax lug"" translates to ""green blue"", suggesting ""dax"" means ""green"".
- ""lug"" on its own equates to ""blue"".
- ""lug dax wif lug"" becomes ""blue green red blue"", indicating that ""wif"" means ""red"".
- ""lug dax lug"" means ""blue green blue"", which reaffirms the meanings of ""lug"" and ""dax"".

Given these observations, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, we see a consistent pattern:

- In every instance where ""dax"" is used, the output is ""green.""
- There are no examples where ""dax"" produces a different color in the output.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that the word ""dax"" translates directly to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word 'wif' consistently corresponds to the color 'red'. Each occurrence of 'wif' in the input results in 'red' in the output, regardless of its position within the sequence or the other words present.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
wif -> red

Rule: When 'wif' appears in the input, it translates to the color 'red' in the output.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Each instance of the word ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the presented examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the color blue every time it appears. However, there's a pattern where the color before ""bluf"" gets repeated after ""bluf."" To better explain:

- In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and after ""bluf,"" blue is repeated once.
- In the second example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and after ""bluf,"" yellow is repeated twice (""wif"" has been established as red; ""walm"" could also be red given the last example, but there seems to be a repetition pattern dependent on the color before ""bluf"").
- In the third example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, so after ""bluf,"" yellow is repeated once.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" is red, so after ""bluf,"" red is repeated twice.
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" is red, so after ""bluf,"" red is repeated once.

According to this pattern, bluf not only translates to the color blue but also dictates that the color immediately preceding it will immediately follow it the number of times it has already appeared in sequence. 

Rule: bluf -> blue followed by the repetition of the color word before it, equalling the number of times this color word appeared before it.
Observing the outputs corresponding to the presence of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can see that each time ""walm"" is used, the output includes a repetition of the color that precedes ""walm"" three times.

Here are the patterns observed:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red""

In each case, the output is the color associated with the word right before ""walm,"" repeated three times. Based on this pattern:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Rule:
When the word ""walm"" is used after another word, the output is the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
By examining the provided examples and their corresponding outputs, we can work towards understanding the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""lug.""

Let's analyze the examples:

Input: zup lug bluf
Output: yellow blue blue

Here ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue."" Since we have ""lug"" between them and the output is ""yellow blue blue,"" it seems that ""lug"" either means ""blue"" or instructs to repeat the color that follows it.

Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
Output: green blue yellow red red green

Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" to ""blue."" Noting the position of ""lug"" it appears between ""dax"" and ""zup,"" the output sequence has ""green blue yellow,"" with ""blue"" being inserted by ""lug."" Again, ""lug"" might be ""blue"" or could be instructing to repeat the color.

Input: zup dax lug walm zup
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

Based on this, ""walm"" appears to be another instance where ""lug"" induces repetition since the output is ""blue blue blue."" 

Input: wif dax lug
Output: red green blue

This example doesn't help much by itself, but based on previous examples, we can assume ""lug"" inserts ""blue"" or causes the following color to be repeated.

Input: zup lug walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue

This strengthens our observation that ""lug"" is associated with blue as it precedes ""walm,"" resulting in multiple occurrences of ""blue.""

Combining the observations from all examples, we can deduce that ""lug"" instructs to repeat the color that comes after it. However, when ""lug"" is followed by a word that doesn't clearly translate to a single base color, such as ""walm"" (which produces multiple blues), it may suggest that ""lug"" could simply mean ""blue"" and the word following ""lug"" may be another rule or control element for repetition.

Given that ""walm"" seems to be the only term that produces repetition when following ""lug,"" and that we don't have examples of ""walm"" without it, the most consistent finding is to interpret ""lug"" directly as ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of ""dax."" Let's analyze each example one by one:

1. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
   Output: blue red green green red blue
   Here, ""dax"" is between ""wif"" and ""bluf,"" both of which translate to ""red"" and ""blue"" respectively. Since ""dax"" seems to be replicating the colors on either side, it is followed by ""green"" which is the sequence before ""wif"" in the output.

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   ""Dax"" is preceded by three repetitions of ""green,"" indicating it might mean ""green"" itself or cause a repetition of the previous color.

3. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   In this sequence, ""dax"" follows ""walm,"" which is translated twice as ""blue."" This suggests ""dax"" took on the color ""green"" which doesn't follow the sequence preceding it but rather seems to introduce a new color or initiates a sequence.

4. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red
   ""Dax"" precedes ""wif"" which translates to ""red."" In this case, ""dax"" is ""green"" again, indicating that it might actually mean ""green.""

5. Input: zup lug dax
   Output: yellow blue green
   The ""dax"" follows ""lug"" which is ""blue,"" but in the output, ""dax"" is translated as ""green,"" further supporting the idea that ""dax"" is ""green.""

Based on the given examples, the occurrences of ""dax"" always correspond to ""green"" in the output. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the output. There doesn't appear to be any context-dependent variability to its meaning. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word 'zup' has a consistent translation in each output, regardless of its position or the words around it. 'Zup' consistently translates to 'yellow'. Here's how it works out in each example:

- ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow,"" where 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'.
- In ""dax lug zup,"" 'dax' corresponds to 'green', 'lug' to 'blue', and 'zup' to 'yellow'.
- ""lug zup wif"" translates to ""blue yellow red,"" where 'zup' is again 'yellow'.
- In ""zup lug zup lug"", the pattern ""yellow blue"" is repeated, confirming that 'zup' is 'yellow', and 'lug' translates to 'blue' consistently.
- Finally, ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow,"" where 'dax' is 'green', and 'zup' is 'yellow' once again; 'bluf' seems to be a typo or an unpredicted input but given the output includes 'yellow' twice and 'zup' appears just once, it appears 'bluf' may not have altered the meaning of 'zup'.

Rule: zup -> 'yellow'
bluf -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word. Rule: The color output for ""bluf"" is duplicated from the color of the word immediately before it.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that each nonce word has a corresponding color associated with it. Here's what each word seems to correspond to:

- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red

Now let's analyze the word ""walm."" Its output color pattern varies depending on its position and occurrence. To deduce what ""walm"" means, let's look at each example:

1. ""zup lug walm wif walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue red red red."" This suggests that the first ""walm"" means ""blue"" (as it follows ""lug,"" which also translates to ""blue""), but the meaning changes by the time of the second ""walm,"" which translates to ""red.""

2. ""zup dax lug walm zup"" becomes ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow,"" implying that here, ""walm"" retains the ""blue"" meaning consistently in this sequence.

3. ""dax lug walm"" outputs ""green blue blue blue,"" which aligns with ""walm"" translating to ""blue"" after ""lug.""

4. ""zup dax walm zup wif"" translates to ""yellow green green green yellow red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" here means ""green,"" influenced by the preceding ""dax.""

5. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" indicating that ""walm"" takes on the color associated with ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it takes on the color of the preceding word, if that color is either blue or green. It does not seem to take on the color yellow, and if it follows ""wif,"" it changes to red. This is not explicitly demonstrated but can be inferred from the fact that the color sequence ends in multiple reds after ""walm"" when ""wif"" is presented in the sequence.

Here is the deduced rule:

Rule: ""walm"" takes on the color of the preceding word, specifically if that color is blue or green. If ""walm"" follows ""wif"" or it occurs multiple times, it turns to red.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: ""walm"" means blue or green depending on whether it follows ""lug"" or ""dax,"" respectively, and red if it follows ""wif"" or occurs consecutively after being initially interpreted as blue.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif walm
    ",Output: red red red,red red red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning: blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Every instance where ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" is encountered, it translates to the color ""red"".
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs from the given examples:

1. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow

2. Input: lug zup
   Output: blue yellow

3. Input: lug walm zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red

4. Input: zup dax zup lug
   Output: yellow green yellow blue

5. Input: wif dax zup dax
   Output: red green yellow green

Examining the outputs corresponding to ""zup,"" we see that ""zup"" always results in ""yellow."" Thus, it does not depend on the surrounding words for its output. Other words like ""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""walm,"" and ""dax"" correspond to ""red,"" ""blue,"" ""blue,"" and ""green,"" respectively, creating a pattern where the previous word seems to define the color but ""zup"" consistently yields yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow. The meaning of ""zup"" is ""yellow"" irrespective of the context.
Based on the examples given, it seems that each nonce word corresponds to a certain color. To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we can look for patterns in the examples.

1. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf - Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
2. Input: wif bluf lug - Output: red red blue
3. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax - Output: red yellow yellow red green
4. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf - Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
5. Input: dax zup bluf - Output: green yellow yellow

By examining the outputs where ""bluf"" appears, we see:
- In example 1, ""bluf"" occurs once and corresponds to blue in the output.
- In example 2, ""bluf"" occurs once and corresponds to blue.
- In example 3, ""bluf"" occurs once and corresponds to blue.
- In example 4, ""bluf"" occurs once and corresponds to blue.
- In example 5, ""bluf"" occurs once and corresponds to yellow.

The discrepancy in example 5 indicates that ""bluf"" might have two colors in its output, which is not aligning with the rest of the examples. Let's re-evaluate the problematic fifth example. Looking closely, it seems that ""dax"" is adding an extra green which should be considered for ""bluf,"" making it also correspond to blue in example 5.

Considering this re-evaluation, every instance of ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue in the output. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as:

Rule: bluf -> blue
Rule: walm -> The repetition of the color of the word preceding it. 

The context indicates that each word corresponds to a color. The word ""walm"" appears to take on the function of repeating the color corresponding to the word that comes directly before it, for as many times as the word ""walm"" has been used in a sequence plus once. 

For example, in the first input ""lug walm dax wif lug wif,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, therefore after ""walm"" the output is ""blue blue blue,"" repeating the color of the preceding word (""lug"") three times—one for the initial occurrence and two additional times for the double ""walm.""

ользуя сведения о цветной последовательности слов ""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""wif,"" и ""zup,"" соответственно blue, green, red, и yellow, мы видим, что ""walm"" вызывает повторение предыдущего цвета столько раз, сколько ""walm"" появляется в подряд, плюс один раз.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif
    ",Output: green red,green red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of the context in which it appears.
Based on the examples provided, there is a pattern that relates the word ""dax"" to the word ""green"". Regardless of its position in the sequence, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the outputs. Thus, the rule can be formulated as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in a sequence or the other words present.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" in the input corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Examining the examples provided, let's look for patterns that could correlate with the word 'bluf' and its output:

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug -> Output: red yellow yellow blue
2. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif -> Output: red red green green red red red blue red
3. Input: wif zup bluf -> Output: red yellow yellow
4. Input: zup wif bluf -> Output: yellow red red
5. Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow

In examples 1, 3, and 5, we notice that the word before 'bluf' is repeated in the output (e.g., 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow' and 'wif' to 'red'). In example 4, where 'zup wif bluf' translates to 'yellow red red', 'bluf' also takes on the color value of the word preceding it. The sequence 'wif bluf' always translates to 'red red', thereby reinforcing our observation.

However, looking at example 2, where we have 'bluf' occurring more than once, we need to consider the sequence and position to determine if the rule holds. The first 'bluf' follows a 'wif' and corresponds to 'red', while the second 'bluf' follows 'dax' and is also translated as 'green', which is the color value associated with 'dax'. 

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that 'bluf' takes on the color value or signifies a repetition of the color value of the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color value of the preceding word.
By analyzing the examples, we can attempt to infer the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""walm."" Let's break down each input line with the corresponding output to find a pattern:

1. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

2. Input: wif walm zup Output: red red red yellow

3. Input: dax lug walm Output: green blue blue blue

4. Input: wif walm Output: red red red

5. Input: wif walm dax zup Output: red red red green yellow

From these examples, we observe the following patterns:

- Every instance of ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before ""walm."" 
- The repetition ends when a new, different word (that has a different color associated with it) appears.

Let's use the observed pattern to define the rule:

Rule:
- ""walm"" causes the last color before it to repeat until a different color word appears or the input sequence ends.

Given this pattern, we can induce the following rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word until a new color word appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax
    ",Output: yellow green,yellow green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" There does not appear to be any variation in the output associated with the context in which ""dax"" is used. Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

Therefore, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: ""dax"" -> ""green""
To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's break down the examples and look for patterns.

Input: wif lug      -> Output: red blue
Input: dax wif      -> Output: green red
Input: wif lug zup bluf -> Output: red blue yellow yellow
Input: wif          -> Output: red
Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

From the first and fourth examples, we can deduce that ""wif"" correlates directly with ""red.""

In the second example, ""wif"" is followed by another word, but it still translates to ""red,"" reinforcing the initial conclusion.

In the third example, ""wif"" appears at the beginning again, translating to ""red,"" followed by ""lug,"" which equals ""blue,"" and other non-""wif"" words correspond to their unique colors.

In the fifth example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" each time, and the other words translate to their respective colors.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

In the first example, ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" corresponds to ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow"", meaning that ""zup"" appears twice and both times it is translated as ""yellow"".

In the second example, ""zup dax lug"" translates to ""yellow green blue"", which supports the initial deduction that ""zup"" means ""yellow"".

The third example, ""wif dax zup"", further confirms this as ""red green yellow"".

The fourth example, ""wif zup lug"", where ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", aligns with the previous examples.

The fifth example, ""zup wif bluf zup lug"", again shows the pattern holding true, with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"".

From these examples, we can confidently establish that the nonce word ""zup"" represents the color ""yellow"". Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> red if preceded by wif; blue otherwise.

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red,"" and in all other contexts, the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue.""
walm -> meaning. Meaning appears to be the word ""blue"" based on the context provided.

Rule: Whenever the nonce word ""walm"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is a sequence of ""blue"" repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the output. It doesn't seem to matter what position ""lug"" is in within the input sequence; its presence always results in the word ""blue"". With the evidence provided, we can therefore deduce the following rule:

lug -> blue. 
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green.""

Input: dax zup -> Output: green yellow

Input: lug dax lug wif -> Output: blue green blue red

Input: wif zup dax -> Output: red yellow green

Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif -> Output: blue green green yellow blue red

Input: wif zup dax bluf -> Output: red yellow green green

The word ""dax"" is always associated with the word ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence. It does not appear to be context-dependent, thus it is safe to conclude:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" Regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present, ""wif"" always results in ""red"" in the output. 

Here is how ""wif"" correlates with ""red"" in each example:

- Input: ""wif bluf dax"" -> Output: ""red red green"" (wif corresponds to the first red)
- Input: ""wif walm dax zup"" -> Output: ""red red red green yellow"" (wif corresponds to the first red)
- Input: ""lug wif lug bluf"" -> Output: ""blue red blue blue"" (wif corresponds to the second red, assuming that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"")
- Input: ""wif walm dax"" -> Output: ""red red red green"" (wif corresponds to the first red)
- Input: ""wif dax"" -> Output: ""red green"" (wif corresponds to the first red)

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow"". Each time ""zup"" is present in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output. The color that follows ""yellow"" in the output, when applicable, is the color associated with the word following ""zup"" in the input. The position of ""zup"" within the input does not affect its output of ""yellow"", indicating that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: Bluf correlates with the color green.

Examples:
- Input: zup bluf dax -> Output: yellow yellow green
- Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
- Input: dax bluf lug wif -> Output: green green blue red
- Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
- Input: wif zup dax bluf -> Output: red yellow green green

According to these examples, every time bluf appears in the input, green is featured in the corresponding position in the output. 

Bluf -> green.
Based on the examples provided:

- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green""
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red""
- ""dax zup dax walm"" translates to ""green yellow green green green""
- ""wif lug walm"" translates to ""red blue blue blue""

Observing the patterns, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it three times. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

walm -> Repeats the color denoted by the word before it three times.

Rule: If a word has an assigned color (e.g., ""dax"" for green, ""zup"" for yellow, ""wif"" for red, ""lug"" for blue), then ""walm"" causes the output to repeat that color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

From the inputs and outputs given:

- Whenever the word ""lug"" appears, the corresponding output includes ""blue.""
- The position of ""lug"" within the input sequence does not affect its output; it consistently maps to ""blue.""
- Other words in the sequences (""walm,"" ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" ""dax"") do not consistently result in ""blue"" in the output, signifying that ""blue"" is tied specifically to the presence of ""lug.""

Hence, ""lug"" means ""blue"" based on the given examples.
Based on the given examples, it seems that each unique word corresponds to a specific color. The word 'dax' consistently corresponds to the color 'green.' Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output. Here's the correlation:

Input: dax bluf wif zup dax -> Output: green green red yellow green
(`zup` corresponds to `yellow`)

Input: zup -> Output: yellow
(`zup` alone still corresponds to `yellow`)

Input: lug zup -> Output: blue yellow
(`zup` corresponds to `yellow`, regardless of its position)

Input: dax wif dax zup bluf -> Output: green red green yellow yellow
(`zup` corresponds to the first `yellow`, while `bluf` that comes after `zup` corresponds to the second `yellow`)

Input: zup lug bluf wif -> Output: yellow blue blue red
(`zup` corresponds to `yellow` at the beginning)

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" is simply:

zup -> yellow

Rule: ""zup"" means ""yellow"".
Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the previous word.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's first inspect the patterns in the examples:

- When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is two greens followed by an additional green for the ""walm"" (Input: ""dax walm"" -> Output: ""green green green"").
- When ""wif"" precedes a ""walm,"" the word ""walm"" generates three reds (Input: ""wif walm"" -> Output: ""red red red"").
- The presence of ""lug"" does not seem to affect the output associated with ""walm"" directly (Input: ""zup lug walm wif walm"" -> Output: ""yellow blue blue blue red red red"" and Input: ""zup wif lug zup walm"" -> Output: ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"").
- ""Walm"" following ""zup"" results in a repetition of the color associated with ""zup"" (Input: ""zup wif lug zup walm"" -> Output: ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"").

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it, repeating the color the number of times equal to the number of letters in that color word. Hence, ""walm"" appears to be a function that echoes the color associated with the previous word. For example:

- ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" which has five letters, so ""walm"" after ""dax"" outputs ""green"" five times.
- ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" which has three letters, so ""walm"" after ""wif"" outputs ""red"" three times.
- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" which has six letters, so ""walm"" after ""zup"" outputs ""yellow"" six times.

However, there are inconsistencies upon closer inspection. In ""dax walm,"" ""walm"" results in three greens, not five as expected if it were to repeat the number of letters in the word ""green."" Thus, the most accurate rule based on the available information would be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the output of the color of the word immediately preceding it, repeated three times regardless of the number of letters in the color word's name.

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" based on these rules appears to be to repeat the previous color word three times in the output.

walm -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" always corresponds to the color ""green"".
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the Output. It does not seem dependent on context or position within the input sequence, given that ""zup"" by itself still results in ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to cause the immediate repetition of the word that comes before it, with each instance of the word transformed into its corresponding color. The transformation is as follows: ""wif"" becomes ""red,"" ""zup"" becomes ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" becomes ""blue.""

Here are the deduced correspondences:

- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- ""lug"" -> ""blue""

The output contains the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""bluf,"" and that color is repeated twice.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:
bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word twice.

Rule: If ""X"" is a word that corresponds to a color, then ""X bluf"" translates to that color repeated twice. For example, ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
From the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. Here's how we can infer this:

1. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   (""lug"" refers to ""blue"", and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times)

2. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

3. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
   (""zup"" refers to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times; then ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""wif"" is ""red"")

4. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red
   (""lug"" refers to ""blue"", and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times; then ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""bluf"" seems to add an additional ""red"")

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   (""zup"" refers to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times)

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" is that it triggers a repetition of three instances of the color related to the word before ""walm"".

zup -> meaning. Based on the examples given where ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" without variation due to context, the rule appears to be:

Rule: The word ""zup"" means ""yellow"".
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" when it follows ""wif"", while it translates to ""yellow"" when it precedes ""dax"". Also, ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" when it follows itself or ""lug"". Let's break it down:

1. Every instance of ""bluf"" has a color associated with it in the output.
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output is always ""red"".
3. When ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"", the output is always ""yellow"".
4. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" or another ""bluf"", the output is ""blue"".

With the examples provided, the general rule for ""bluf"" is highly context-dependent:

1. ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"", indicating ""wif"" doesn't change the color, but ""bluf"" translates to red here.
2. ""dax wif bluf"" results in ""green red red"", indicating ""dax"" translates to green, ""wif"" doesn't affect the color, and ""bluf"" is red following ""wif"".
3. ""zup wif bluf"" results in ""yellow red red"", where ""zup"" translates to yellow, ""wif"" again seems not to affect the color, and ""bluf"" is red after ""wif"".
4. ""zup bluf dax"" results in ""yellow yellow green"", where ""zup"" is yellow, ""bluf"" before ""dax"" is yellow, and ""dax"" is green.
5. ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" results in ""blue red red green blue blue"". Here, ""lug"" translates to blue, ""wif"" doesn't change the color, ""bluf"" after ""wif"" and before ""dax"" is red, ""dax"" after ""bluf"" is green, and ""bluf"" after ""lug"" or itself is blue.

Based on the contextual evidence:

bluf -> meaning:
- ""bluf"" means red when it follows ""wif"".
- ""bluf"" means yellow when it precedes ""dax"".
- ""bluf"" means blue when it follows ""lug"" or another ""bluf"".

Rule:
- The meaning of ""bluf"" changes based on the word that immediately precedes or follows it.
walm -> the repetition of the color corresponding to the previous nonce word. Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" follows another nonce word, the color associated with the preceding nonce word is repeated three times. If ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color red, the output includes ""red"" repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup dax lug dax
    ",Output: green yellow green blue green,green yellow green blue green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, we can analyze the patterns of color representation for each word. The word ""dax"" seems to correspond to a specific color in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence. Below is the analysis:

- In the first input, ""dax"" is placed after two occurrences of ""zup wif"" and corresponds to the color ""green"".
- In the second input, ""dax"" is placed after ""wif"" and corresponds to the color ""green"".
- In the third input, ""dax"" comes after ""zup"" and corresponds to the color ""green"".
- In the fourth input, when ""dax"" is preceded by ""lug wif,"" it still corresponds to the color ""green"".
- In the fifth input, ""dax"" is the first word and followed by ""walm lug,"" still corresponding to the color ""green"".

Considering these observations, it is clear that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position or the surrounding words.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red."" No matter its position within the list of words (beginning, middle, or end), the presence of ""wif"" always maps to ""red.""

Thus, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""zup"" consistently translates to the word ""yellow"". No matter the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence or the other words around it, the output for ""zup"" remains the same. Other words like ""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""bluf,"" and ""wif"" also have consistent translations (""blue,"" ""green,"" ""blue,"" and ""red,"" respectively). Considering this, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> red

Rule: The nonce word bluf corresponds to the color red in the given examples.
walm -> repetition of the previous color.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" is used, it indicates that the color corresponding to the previous word should be repeated. If the previous color is 'green', then ""walm"" would mean to repeat 'green'; likewise, if the previous color is 'red', then ""walm"" would translate to 'red', and so on.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the provided examples.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position within the input sequence.
Rule: wif -> red

Based on the examples provided, “wif” consistently translates to “red” regardless of its position within the input sequence.
Through analyzing the examples provided, we can attempt to discern a pattern and deduce the meaning or rule behind the word ""zup.""

1. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green
   - The color ""yellow"" precedes the sequence without a direct matching word, implying ""zup"" might mean yellow.

2. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   - Once again, the first color is ""yellow"" following ""zup,"" while ""lug"" and ""walm"" translate to ""blue"" colors.

3. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   - Here ""zup"" and ""walm"" both produce ""yellow,"" suggesting that ""walm"" might have some conditional link with ""zup,"" but with ""zup"" explicitly stated first, ""yellow"" is affirmed as the likely meaning for ""zup.""

4. Input: wif zup lug zup lug
   Output: red yellow blue yellow blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow"" in two instances here, despite being surrounded by other words (""wif"" and ""lug""), which are red and blue respectively.

5. Input: dax zup lug wif lug
   Output: green yellow blue red blue
   - Here ""zup"" is positioned after ""dax"" and the color sequence again includes ""yellow"" following ""zup,"" strengthening its association.

Given the consistency of ""yellow"" following ""zup"" across various contexts and regardless of position or surrounding words, the following rule can be identified:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the provided examples, bluf appears to be related to the word that follows it in some manner (except in cases where it is the last word). When a word is preceded by bluf, the color that corresponds to that word is repeated once more. This pattern can be seen as we look at the word that follows bluf and the corresponding colors in the Output. If bluf is the last word in the sequence, it corresponds to the color red.

Let's outline the correspondence of the given words to colors from the examples:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- walm -> yellow (inferred from the first example)

Now, let's test our hypothesis with each Input/Output pair:

1. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   In this sequence, bluf precedes no word and corresponds to 'red red'.

2. Input: dax lug bluf
   Output: green blue blue
   In this sequence, bluf is followed by no word, so if our assumption is correct, it should correspond to 'blue', but the color 'blue blue' is given, so the rule appears to differ when bluf is the concluding word of the sequence.

3. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   Here, wif follows bluf and thus 'wif' corresponds to 'red red'.

4. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
   Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
   In this sequence, 'wif' follows bluf, thus corresponding to 'red red'.

5. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow green yellow green red red
   Here, bluf concludes the sequence and thus corresponds to 'red red'.

In conclusion, it seems that when bluf is followed by a word, it causes the color of the following word to be duplicated. When bluf is the last word, the output is 'red red'. However, there is an inconsistency in the sequence with 'dax lug bluf', so either there is an error in the provided data or an exception to the rule that is not explained by the given examples.

Therefore, the rule might be:

Rule: bluf -> when followed by a word, the color assigned to that word is repeated. If bluf is the last word, the output is 'red red'. However, this rule is uncertain due to inconsistency in the provided examples.
Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" seems to correspond to a repetition of the color indicated by the preceding word. No instance shows ""walm"" directly followed by a different color that would contradict this rule. The word before ""walm"" in each example is a color, and the output always repeats that color three times if the word comes directly after the color or repeats the color as many times as the color’s first repetition after the term ""wif"" appears.

Here is the breakdown:

- ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green"".
- In ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif,"" ""walm"" first corresponds to ""blue blue blue"" (following ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"") and then ""yellow yellow yellow"" (following ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"").

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be: repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times. 

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position or the context within which it is used. Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green.

Based on the given examples, each time the nonce word ""dax"" is used in the input, the corresponding output is the color ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, we can observe how the color output changes with the presence of the word ""wif."" Let's analyze each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

2. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red

3. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

4. Input: wif
   Output: red

5. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue

In these examples, every time the word ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red."" Therefore, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds directly to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Each time the word ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output. The color assigned to ""zup"" does not change with context, suggesting that ""zup"" consistently means ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the pattern given in each input/output pair:

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
- Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and results in a repetition of ""green.""

Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax
Output: green green yellow yellow green
- ""Bluf"" following ""dax"" results in ""green green,"" and ""bluf"" following ""zup"" results in ""yellow yellow."" After the second ""bluf,"" it returns to ""dax,"" which gives ""green.""

Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green
- ""Bluf"" follows ""dax"" which is preceded by ""wif."" The sequence ""wif dax"" results in ""red green,"" and then ""bluf"" repeats the most recent color, ""green.""

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
- ""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" which is preceded by ""wif,"" resulting in a repetition ""yellow yellow."" ""Wif"" after ""bluf"" doesn't immediately repeat a color, suggesting ""walm"" could be influencing the additional ""red"" at the end.

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red
- ""Bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which followed ""zup,"" leading to ""red red,"" which is a repetition of the ""red"" from ""wif.""

Based on the examples, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color word (output) that immediately precedes it, regardless of the color's associated input word.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the previous color word in the output.
Each example associates ""walm"" with a series of colored outputs. From the information provided, it appears that ""walm"" is consistently followed by a sequence of the same color. To determine what ""walm"" dictates about the color and its repetition, let's analyze the instances:

1. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green
   - After ""walm,"" we see ""green"" repeated three times.

2. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   - Here, we see ""walm"" followed by ""green"" three times and ""walm"" again followed by ""red"" three times, so ""walm"" seems to triple the color that comes before it.

3. Input: lug dax walm wif
   Output: blue green green green red
   - Again, ""green"" follows ""walm"" and is repeated three times.

4. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - The color ""blue"" is after ""lug"" and repeated three times post ""walm.""

5. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - After ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated three times.

From these examples, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the previous color word to repeat three times in the output. 

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color to be repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax wif lug walm zup
    ",Output: red green red blue blue blue yellow,red green red blue blue blue yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the output, regardless of the context in which it appears.
From the given examples, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to a specific color output each time it appears. Let's analyze each input and its corresponding output to deduce the meaning.

Input: zup lug walm wif dax
Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
- Here, ""dax"" appears at the end, and the color green is last in the sequence.

Input: dax zup wif
Output: green yellow red
- ""dax"" leads the sequence, and green does as well.

Input: dax
Output: green
- ""dax"" is the only input, and green is the only output.

Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green
- ""dax"" is the middle term; green is still output in the middle position.

Input: zup dax wif
Output: yellow green red
- ""dax"" is second, and green is also the second color in the output sequence.

From the available examples, the rule is consistent that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following patterns that provide clues to the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"":

1. Whenever ""wif"" appears, the color ""red"" is also present in the output.
2. ""Wif"" does not seem to map to a specific color, as its presence corresponds to different colors in each example.
3. The color ""red"" is only in the output when ""wif"" is in the input, suggesting that ""wif"" is directly linked to the color ""red"" in the output but may have another rule affecting the preceding color.
4. In sequences with ""lug walm"" followed by ""wif,"" it seems ""wif"" induces ""red"" after the pattern of ""blue blue blue.""
5. When ""wif"" stands alone or is the first word in the sequence, the output is only ""red.""

From these observations, the rule that seems most consistent is:

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, it corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output sequence. If ""wif"" is preceded by a color-inducing word, it triggers the corresponding color for that word before it induces ""red."" If ""wif"" is standalone or starts the sequence, it only triggers ""red.""

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" could be defined as:

wif -> Induces the color ""red"" in the output, possibly after inducing the color associated with the preceding element(s).
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" regardless of the context in which it appears. It seems to function as a color indicator in this system, consistently mapping to ""yellow"" in all given examples.
Based on the provided input-output pairs, we can deduce a pattern that associates each nonce word with a particular color. For every instance where ""bluf"" appears in the input, there are two consecutive ""red"" outputs in the corresponding output.

Here are the associations for each word based on the examples given:

- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- bluf -> doubles the color of the word that comes immediately before it

Given these associations, we can formulate the following rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the preceding word.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" is associated with a repetition of the color that precedes it. In every instance, the color that comes before ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output.

Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue. The output for ""walm"" is blue repeated three times.

2. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow. The output for ""walm"" is yellow repeated three times.

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow. The output for ""walm"" is yellow repeated three times.

4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green. The output for ""walm"" is green repeated three times.

5. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   The first ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, so the output for ""walm"" is green repeated three times. The second ""walm"" also follows ""dax"" and therefore the output for ""walm"" is again green repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" repeats the color that precedes it three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Given the examples provided and analyzing the position of ""lug"" and the corresponding outputs in each instance, we can deduce that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.

Here is the rule deduced from the examples:
lug -> blue

So the general rule can be stated as follows: 
Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.
From the provided examples, it seems that the output color corresponds to each word in the input. To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we can look at the color that appears in the output when ""dax"" is present in the input.

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red
(dax -> green, walm -> green, wif -> green, bluf -> red red)

Input: wif dax
Output: red green
(wif -> red, dax -> green)

Input: dax wif zup dax
Output: green red yellow green
(dax -> green, wif -> red, zup -> yellow, dax -> green)

Input: zup dax lug
Output: yellow green blue
(zup -> yellow, dax -> green, lug -> blue)

Input: zup bluf dax
Output: yellow yellow green
(zup -> yellow, bluf -> yellow, dax -> green)

According to these examples, every instance of ""dax"" corresponds with a green in the output, regardless of where ""dax"" appears in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" appears to be consistent:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following meanings for each nonce word:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- walm -> red
- bluf -> blue
- zup -> yellow

The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the word ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, we can conclude:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" in this context appears to be that ""zup"" represents the color ""yellow.""

Here is the breakdown:
- In each example with ""zup,"" the output includes the color ""yellow"" in the corresponding position to ""zup.""
- ""zup"" consistent translation to ""yellow"" does not depend on its position in the input sequence.
- There is one instance where ""zup"" is the only input, and the output is simply ""yellow."" This helps to confirm the direct translation.

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" is:

zup -> yellow.
Rule: bluf -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we look for patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

1. When ""walm"" directly follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red.""
   - Input: wif walm dax zup => Output: red red red green yellow
   - Input: wif walm dax => Output: red red red green
   - Input: dax walm wif walm => Output: green green green red red red

2. When ""walm"" directly follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""
   - Input: dax walm wif bluf => Output: green green green red red
   - Input: dax lug walm => Output: green blue blue blue
   - Input: dax walm wif walm => Output: green green green red red red

3. ""wif"" on its own correlates to ""red.""
   - Input: dax walm wif bluf => Output: green green green red red
   - Input: dax walm wif walm => Output: green green green red red red

4. ""dax"" on its own correlates to ""green.""
   - Input: dax walm wif bluf => Output: green green green red red

5. ""walm"" does not appear by itself, so we can't determine its individual color correlation.

6. The color outputs for ""wif"" and ""dax"" are consistent regardless of the presence of ""walm,"" suggesting ""walm"" does not change the outputs for these words.

Based on the above observations, ""walm"" acts as a repetitive operator for the color of the word that precedes it. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the color ""red"" is repeated once. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the color ""green"" is repeated once.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, it repeats the color output associated with that word exactly once. For example, if the word before ""walm"" outputs ""red,"" ""walm"" will also result in an additional ""red."" If the word before ""walm"" outputs ""green,"" ""walm"" will result in an additional ""green,"" and so on for other colors if applicable.


    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" The other words in the input seem to correspond to other colors, and the position of ""lug"" doesn't affect its meaning. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue
Comparing the provided inputs and outputs, we can induce that there is a consistent mapping from the nonce word 'dax' and other words to specific color outputs. The word 'dax' appears in each input and consistently maps to 'green' in the output.

Let's look at each example:

Input: dax
Output: green
Rule: 'dax' maps to 'green'.

Input: dax wif lug dax
Output: green red blue green
Rule: In addition to 'dax' mapping to 'green', 'wif' maps to 'red' and 'lug' maps to 'blue'.

Input: dax zup wif
Output: green yellow red
Rule: Here, 'zup' maps to 'yellow', while the previous mappings for 'dax' to 'green' and 'wif' to 'red' are consistent.

Input: wif dax
Output: red green
Rule: The previously established mappings are consistent again with 'wif' -> 'red' and 'dax' -> 'green'.

Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
Rule: The new word 'walm' maps to 'blue', and all previous mappings of 'zup' to 'yellow', 'dax' to 'green', and 'lug' to 'blue' are consistent.

Based on the information provided, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green

The other words 'wif', 'lug', 'zup', and 'walm' also map consistently to specific colors, which are 'red', 'blue', 'yellow', and 'blue' respectively.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" appears to be as follows:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""red"".
zup -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, zup consistently corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.

Rule: zup means yellow.
From the given examples, we can infer that each word corresponds to a certain color. Observing what happens when the nonce word ""bluf"" appears in different examples, we see that whenever ""bluf"" is present, it results in the word ""red"" being in the output.

Example 1 adds an instance of ""blue"" to the output, but since ""bluf"" appears twice and so does ""red"", and the first instance of ""red"" does not correspond to ""blue"" (as shown in Examples 2, 3, and 4), we can deduce that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" rather than ""blue"".

In each example, the presence of ""bluf"" gives the same result irrespective of position or surrounding words:

Input: wif bluf lug dax wif -> Output: red red blue green red
- Here ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red"". 

Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
- Here ""bluf"" is directly giving us ""red"".

Input: zup bluf dax -> Output: yellow yellow green
- Again, ""bluf"" is giving ""yellow"", but since other examples show ""zup"" consistently produces ""yellow"", ""bluf"" must be responsible for the second ""yellow"", which we infer to be ""red"".

Input: zup bluf wif walm -> Output: yellow yellow red red red
- The direct result of ""bluf"" is the second ""yellow"", which is ""red"".

Input: zup wif bluf -> Output: yellow red red
- Here ""bluf"" clearly correlates with the last ""red"".

Given the data, I will state the rule as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> meaning is ""red"".
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: ""lug walm"" -> Output: ""blue blue blue""
2. Input: ""lug walm"" -> Output: ""blue blue blue""
3. Input: ""zup dax walm zup wif"" -> Output: ""yellow green green green yellow red""
4. Input: ""dax zup dax walm"" -> Output: ""green yellow green green green""
5. Input: ""lug dax walm wif"" -> Output: ""blue green green green red""

By comparing all the examples, we can see:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears, the output contains a repetition of a color word three times.
- The repeated color word in the output is determined by the standalone word that precedes ""walm"" in the input.

Let's gather the input-output patterns:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Now, let's translate this understanding of our observations into the rule:

""walm"" -> ""repeat the output color corresponding to the previous word three times""

Thus, for ""lug walm,"" the color that corresponds to ""lug"" is ""blue,"" so ""walm"" means ""blue blue blue.""
For ""zup dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""walm"" means ""green green green.""

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

To find the rule for ""dax"", let's look at the consistent pattern in each input and output pair.

Input: dax lug dax lug walm
Output: green blue green blue blue blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Input: dax zup wif zup
Output: green yellow red yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: lug dax zup lug wif
Output: blue green yellow blue red
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" isn't clear in this example but seems to not affect the rule for ""dax""

Input: lug dax zup dax wif
Output: blue green yellow green red
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Given these examples, we see that every time ""dax"" appears in an input, the color ""green"" appears in the corresponding output position, regardless of the context. Therefore, ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of the context in which it appears.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"", we need to look for patterns in the given examples in terms of position and corresponding color output. Let's examine each case:

1) Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
   Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
   Observation: ""bluf"" occurs twice, and both times it has been translated to ""blue"".

2) Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   Observation: ""bluf"" occurs twice, once after ""wif"" and once after ""dax"", both times translated to ""green"". This is a contradiction to what we observed in example 1.

3) Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   Observation: ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and results in ""yellow"".

4) Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red
   Observation: ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and results in ""red"".

5) Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue red green green red
   Observation: ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and results in ""green"".

From these observations, the pattern that emerges is that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is that it means ""the same color as the preceding word.""

bluf -> meaning. Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the sequence of words and the corresponding output of colors and try to find a pattern.

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Input: dax zup dax walm
Output: green yellow green green green

Input: dax lug dax lug walm
Output: green blue green blue blue blue

Let's analyze:

1. ""wif bluf dax walm"" produces two reds, followed by one green and then two more greens. It seems like the color green is associated with the word ""dax"" since it appears once and two greens are shown in the output. ""Bluf"" has appeared once and is associated with red, while ""wif"" also corresponds to red. ""Walm"" in this context could be repeating the color associated with the word before it, which is green.

2. However, in ""zup walm lug zup wif dax,"" the word ""walm"" occurs after ""zup,"" which is associated with yellow, and before ""lug,"" which is associated with blue. The presence of ""walm"" here does not affect the color for ""lug"" but it does result in repeated yellows. ""Walm"" here repeats the color pattern from ""zup"".

3. ""Zup walm"" results in triple yellow, as ""zup"" is associated with yellow and ""walm"" repeats this pattern.

4. ""Dax zup dax walm"" has green associated with ""dax,"" and ""walm"" repeats the green.

5. ""Dax lug dax lug walm"" has green repeated twice for the two occurrences of ""dax,"" and then blue repeated twice more when ""lug"" appears twice. When ""walm"" appears, the pattern of blue continues.

Looking across these examples, it can be deduced that ""walm"" seems to repeat the pattern of the color associated with the immediately preceding word. If the preceding word appears once, the pattern is repeated once. If the preceding word appears twice in a row, the repeating pattern is doubled. Therefore, we can say:

Walm -> meaning: ""Walm"" causes the repetition of the color pattern associated with the immediately preceding word.

Rule: If the preceding word's color is X and appears N times consecutively before ""walm,"" then the color X will be repeated N(N+1)/2 times as output for ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax walm wif
    ",Output: yellow green green green red,yellow green green green red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the provided examples, it appears that whenever the word ""dax"" is included in the input, the color ""green"" is included in the output, regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the input or the presence of other words.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's look at the consistent output each time the input ""wif"" is provided:

Input: wif
Output: red

Input: wif
Output: red

Input: lug wif
Output: blue red

Input: wif
Output: red

Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green

From these examples, we can observe that every time ""wif"" is input, the output always includes ""red."" This is a consistent one-to-one relationship between the input ""wif"" and the output ""red,"" regardless of the context or the presence of other words.

Additionally, when ""wif"" is combined with other nonce words like ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and ""walm,"" it precedes additional colors in the output, but the ""red"" corresponding to ""wif"" is always present. Therefore, considering the data provided, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" each time it is used. It does not seem dependent on its position in the input string, as it remains consistent whether it appears at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of the input.

Here is how ""zup"" is used in the given examples:

1. ""zup lug walm wif walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""
2. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
3. ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
4. ""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red""
5. ""lug zup"" -> ""blue yellow""

Regardless of its position, ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
To induce the rule for the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns in the examples provided.

From the first example:
Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

From the second example:
Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

From the third example:
Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

From the fourth example:
Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
Output: red yellow yellow red green

From the fifth example:
Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red

Analyzing the color patterns in relation to the presence of ""bluf,"" the following can be deduced:

1. ""bluf"" appears after a word; the color that follows repeats the last color mentioned before ""bluf."" For example:
- In ""dax zup bluf,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and after ""bluf,"" yellow repeats.
- In ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, and after ""bluf,"" red repeats.
  
2. ""bluf"" does not change the color of words not adjacent to it. For example:
- In ""wif zup bluf wif dax,"" ""wif"" and ""dax"" flanking ""bluf"" are red and green respectively, but ""bluf"" only affects the word directly after it, making it yellow (repeating the color of ""zup"").

3. ""bluf"" affects only the word directly following it. For example:
- In ""dax walm wif bluf,"" the output is green green green red red. After the word ""bluf,"" ""red"" is repeated even with another instance of ""wif"" following.

Rule: bluf -> causes the color of the word immediately following it to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it.
Rule: The word ""walm"" translates to repeating the color immediately preceding it three times. 

This rule is consistent with the examples given:

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
walm here is preceded by ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"" and it is repeated three times in the output.

Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
""walm"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"" and ""red"" is repeated three times immediately after ""walm"".

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
Again, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which is green and repeated three times.

Input: dax walm wif zup
Output: green green green red yellow
""walm"" again follows ""dax"" which is green and ""green"" is repeated three times. ""walm"" does not affect the words following it, which are translated normally according to their respective colors.

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue
""walm"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times after ""walm"". 

So, walm -> meaning is that it causes the color word immediately before it to be outputted three times in a row.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug walm dax walm
    ",Output: green blue blue blue green green green,green blue blue blue green green green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color blue in the output.
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the meaning of ""wif"" by comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs.

Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
Output: blue green yellow green green green red

Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

Input: dax wif
Output: green red

Input: wif dax zup walm
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue

By analyzing the outputs corresponding to the input ""wif,"" we observe that ""wif"" consistently results in the color ""red."" In each example, the presence of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the output, irrespective of the position of ""wif"" in the input string or the surrounding words. No other word in the inputs corresponds directly to ""red"" in the outputs.

Therefore, the rule we can induce is:

wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" acts as a mirror, reflecting the color of the word immediately preceding it in the output sequence. If ""wif"" results in ""red,"" then ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red."" If ""dax"" outputs ""green,"" then ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green,"" and so forth. 

Hence, bluf -> the color of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the examples provided and how they correlate with their respective outputs:

1. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red

2. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

3. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

4. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

5. Input: lug dax walm wif
   Output: blue green green green red

Analyzing the patterns:

- Whenever we see ""walm"" in the input, the output contains several colors that repeat except for the last color, which is red.
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" as shown by their consistent translation in each example.
- We can note that for each instance of ""walm,"" the repeated color in the output directly follows the word that precedes ""walm."" For example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" has translated to ""blue.""
- Identifying that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" is seen by its consistent appearance as the final color in outputs 1, 3, and 5, and it directly follows ""walm.""

Given these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word multiple times (three times in these examples) before ending with ""red."" Based on these examples, the word ""walm"" seems to be a function where it repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately before it three times followed by ""red.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the word before ""walm"" three times and then add ""red.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the information provided, each input term appears to correspond to a color in the output. The term ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue."" Other terms appear to correspond to other colors, with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red"" and ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow."" The term ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" as well, perhaps indicating a typo or an alternative representation for the color ""yellow.""

We can define the meaning of ""lug"" as follows:

lug -> meaning: ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.

Rule: When ""lug"" is an input, output ""blue.""
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sentence. Each appearance of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red.""

Thus, the rule can be stated as:

wif -> red

Rule: ""wif"" means ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the input-output pairs:

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears, the color immediately following it in the output is the same as the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" in the input.

Let's examine each input-output case:

1. Input: zup wif bluf | Output: yellow red red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red, and the color following ""bluf"" in the output is red.

2. Input: dax bluf wif zup dax | Output: green green red yellow green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green, and the color following ""bluf"" in the output is green.

3. Input: wif bluf dax walm | Output: red red green green green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red, and the color following ""bluf"" in the output is red.

4. Input: zup bluf lug | Output: yellow yellow blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and the color following ""bluf"" in the output is yellow.

5. Input: dax bluf | Output: green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green, and there are no more colors after ""green,"" implying ""bluf"" carries over the color from ""dax.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> ""Repeat the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding 'bluf' in the input.""
Upon examining the given examples, the word ""walm"" appears to consistently correspond to the word ""red"" in the output. Notably, whenever ""walm"" is present in the input, the output contains an additional ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence. This pattern suggests that ""walm"" itself translates to ""red,"" and it also adds an extra ""red"" to the output every time it appears. There is no instance where ""walm"" appears without ""red"" following it in the output. Additionally, ""walm"" does not seem to influence the translation of other words; their translations remain consistent whether or not ""walm"" is included in the input.

Hence, we conclude:

Rule: walm -> ""red"" and add an additional ""red"" to the output sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every given example.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the given examples.
To deduce the rule, we look at the color associated with ""wif"" in every given example:

- In the first example, ""wif"" appears twice and is associated with ""red"" both times.
- In the second example, ""wif"" appears once and is associated with ""red"".
- In the third example, ""wif"" appears once at the end and is associated with ""red"".
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" appears twice and is associated with ""red"" both times.
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" appears once and is associated with ""red"".

Given that ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red"" in every instance, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> meaning. Meaning: yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Observing the color patterns associated with the appearance of ""bluf"" in each input and the corresponding color in the output, we can deduce a pattern:

Input: zup dax bluf   -> Output: yellow green green
Input: zup bluf wif   -> Output: yellow yellow red
Input: lug bluf dax lug -> Output: blue blue green blue
Input: zup wif bluf   -> Output: yellow red red
Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

In these examples, ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the color is yellow, and when it follows ""lug,"" the color is blue. It does not seem to matter what word comes after ""bluf,"" as ""bluf"" still follows the rule and takes on the preceding word's color.

The rule thus seems to be: bluf takes on the color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word.
From the examples given, it appears that the word ""walm"" is an instruction to repeat the color that comes before it three times.

1. In the first example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"", implying that ""zup"" means ""yellow"" and ""walm"" means to repeat the color three times.
2. The second example, ""lug walm"", leads to ""blue blue blue"", thus ""lug"" means ""blue"" and ""walm"" repeats the color three times.
3. In the third example, ""dax walm"" and ""zup walm"" turn into ""green green green"" and ""yellow yellow yellow"" respectively, again showing that ""walm"" repeats the preceding color three times.
4. The fourth example, ""dax lug walm"", converts to ""green blue blue blue"", indicating that after ""dax"" (which means green) and ""lug"" (which means blue), ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""lug's"" corresponding color, blue, three times.
5. Finally, in the fifth example, ""wif walm"" becomes ""red red red"", which shows that ""wif"" means ""red"" and ""walm"" repeats the color red three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color name three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning behind the nonce word ""dax,"" let's look for patterns associated with its appearance in the examples:

First Example:  
Input: **dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax**  
Output: **green blue blue blue green red red green**  

""dax"" appears at the beginning, middle, and end of the sequence, each time associated with the output ""green.""

Second Example:  
Input: **wif zup lug dax zup walm**  
Output: **red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow**

""dax"" appears once and is associated with ""green.""

Third Example:  
Input: **dax zup walm wif**  
Output: **green yellow yellow yellow red**

""dax"" appears once at the beginning and is associated with ""green.""

Fourth Example:  
Input: **dax**  
Output: **green**

""dax"" is the only word present and ""green"" is the output.

Fifth Example:  
Input: **dax zup bluf**  
Output: **green yellow yellow**

""dax"" appears once at the beginning and is followed by ""green.""

In all instances, regardless of the position or the words that follow, ""dax"" maps to ""green."" We can infer that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of context within these examples.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each word corresponds to a specific color. The word 'wif' consistently translates to the color 'red' in every example. There is no indication that 'wif' changes meaning depending on context; it consistently means the same color regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present.

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the relationship between the input and output in each example:

1. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

2. Input: zup bluf lug dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow blue green blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

3. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""red""

4. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

5. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Given these examples, ""bluf"" seems to always correspond to ""blue"" in the output except when ""wif"" or ""dax"" proceeds directly before ""bluf"". In those cases, the output color for ""bluf"" changes to align with the color of the word that precedes it (""red"" for ""wif"" and ""yellow"" for ""zup""). However, we only have one example of ""dax"" followed by ""bluf"" generating ""yellow"", which is the same output for ""zup"", so that might not be sufficient evidence to generalize.

Still, based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" except when preceded directly by ""wif"", wherein it takes the color coded to ""wif"", which is ""red"". In the absence of multiple cases showing what happens with ""dax"" prior to ""bluf"", it is less certain what the rule is in that instance. 

Rule: bluf -> blue, unless preceded by ""wif"", in which case bluf -> red. The case with ""dax"" preceding ""bluf"" is not fully understood, but given the sole example, bluf may take on the color of the word that precedes it when it is not ""lug"".
To understand the meaning of ""walm,"" let us compare the inputs and outputs while analyzing any patterns:

1. Input: dax walm                     Output: green green green
2. Input: dax lug wif walm          Output: green blue red red red
3. Input: wif walm                      Output: red red red
4. Input: lug walm wif bluf          Output: blue blue blue red red
5. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax      Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

Here's what we can observe:

- In Example 1, the word 'dax' is followed by 'walm', and the output is 'green' repeated three times.
- In Example 2, the word 'walm' appears after 'wif', and the output is 'red' repeated three times.
- In Example 3, 'walm' is repeated after 'wif' only, and the output again is 'red' repeated three times.
- In Example 4, 'walm' appears after 'lug', and the output is 'blue' repeated three times.
- In Example 5, 'walm' appears after 'zup', and the output is 'yellow' repeated three times.

From the above observations, it seems that 'walm' is a rule that means ""repeat the color associated with the previous word three times."" Examining the input before 'walm' in each case gives us the color:

- 'dax' leads to 'green', 
- 'wif' leads to 'red', 
- 'lug' leads to 'blue', and
- 'zup' leads to 'yellow'.

So the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Considering the patterns in the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs. When ""dax"" is used in the input, the word ""green"" is used consistently in the respective position in the output:

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow green red red

- ""dax"" follows ""walm"" (which corresponds to ""yellow"") and is followed by ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red""), but the word for ""dax"" remains ""green"".

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

- Here ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"", which corresponds to ""green"", reinforcing the association of ""dax"" with ""green"".

Input: zup dax lug
Output: yellow green blue

- Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Input: wif dax zup dax
Output: red green yellow green

- In this example, ""dax"" appears twice and corresponds to ""green"" both times.

Input: wif dax wif
Output: red green red

- Even though ""dax"" is flanked by ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red""), it still maps to ""green"".

Based on these observations, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. Whenever it is used in an input, the output includes the word ""red"". Additionally, the word appears to stand alone as an instruction and does not seem to modify or require additional context from surrounding words.

Therefore, we can establish the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" consistently. Thus the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
From the given examples, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" by looking at the output in each case.

1. Input: zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow yellow blue

2. Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
   Output: green green red blue yellow

3. Input: dax bluf wif zup dax
   Output: green green red yellow green

4. Input: dax lug wif bluf
   Output: green blue red red

5. Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
   Output: green green red yellow red

By examining each example, we notice that the word ""bluf"" results in different colors depending on its position relative to other words:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is between ""zup"" and ""lug"" which translate to ""yellow"" and ""blue"", respectively. ""Bluf"" results in ""yellow,"" which is the same as the color before it.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which translates to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" becomes ""red,"" a color we haven't seen before. The next word ""wif"" is also a different new color ""red.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" results in ""red"" again, a color different from the green of ""dax"" both before and after it.
- The fourth example shows ""bluf"" at the end resulting in ""red,"" the same color as the ""wif"" that precedes it.
- In the last example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" both resulting in ""red"" again.

The consistent rule here is not immediately clear because ""bluf"" corresponds to different colors. However, we observe that ""bluf"" is always followed by a color that has either come immediately before it or is a new color (""red"") not previously mentioned in the sequence. Given that ""red"" is the only new color that appears after ""bluf"" and not influenced by any direct context, we might conjecture that ""bluf"" itself is a direct indication for ""red,"" but only when there's no context clue preceding it to indicate a repetition of a previous color.

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning. Rule:
- When preceded by a color word (like ""zup"" for yellow or ""dax"" for green), ""bluf"" results in the same color as the word before it.
- When there's no immediate repetition of a color, or the color pattern is unclear, ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""

So the tentative rule could be:

bluf -> red, unless another rule specifies it should mimic the color directly preceding it.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

3. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue

4. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

5. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

From the above examples, we can infer that each word in the input corresponds to a color.

- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to green.
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""bluf"" corresponds to blue.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red.

We are trying to find the rule for ""walm."" By examining the inputs and outputs, we notice the following:

- In the second example, ""dax walm"" repeats the color green one extra time, more than the number of times ""dax"" appears.
- In the first and third examples, ""walm"" results in an additional green being added to the output, but there is no ""walm"" in the output, suggesting it triggers the color before it to be repeated without appearing itself.
- In the fourth example, with the input ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug,"" we can see that ""walm"" occurs before the last ""lug"" and results in ""yellow"" being repeated rather than ""blue"" from the preceding ""lug.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug walm dax wif lug wif,"" ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated.

The consistent rule across all examples seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color of the word immediately before it to be repeated in the output sequence.

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the previous color word’s color to be repeated.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" always corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. It does not seem to change its meaning based on position or other words around it. Therefore, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> meaning. Rule: dax means ""green"".
Based on the examples provided, each instance of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the output:

Input: dax walm wif zup -> Output: green green green red yellow
- Here ""wif"" correlates to the word ""red.""

Input: wif -> Output: red
- ""wif"" is directly translated as ""red.""

Input: wif zup -> Output: red yellow
- ""wif"" correlates to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif -> Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
- The pattern continues, with ""wif"" being ""red.""

Input: zup bluf wif walm -> Output: yellow yellow red red red
- Once again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" It is not context-dependent since regardless of position, ""wif"" always results in ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red. The meaning of ""wif"" is ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Here is the analysis:

- In the first example, the term ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red,"" and when ""zup"" follows ""wif,"" the output includes ""yellow"" after ""red.""

- In the subsequent examples, every instance of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position relative to other words.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" in the context of these examples is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> meaning: the word ""bluf"" repeats the color of the previous word. 

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows another word representing a color, it repeats that color in the output. If ""wif"" signifies red, then ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"". Similarly, if ""zup"" signifies yellow and ""lug"" signifies blue, ""zup lug bluf"" results in ""yellow blue blue"", and so on for other colors in the pattern.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in the examples provided:

Input: lug walm zup walm
Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow

Here, ""lug"" corresponds to three repetitions of ""blue"" and ""zup"" precedes three repetitions of ""yellow."" ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" but appears before ""zup"" in sequence, indicating that ""walm"" might mean repeating the last color named three times.

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Here, ""wif"" leads to three repetitions of ""red,"" and since ""walm"" follows it with no other information, it likely means repeating the color (red) three times.

Input: wif walm zup walm
Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow

The pattern is consistent with the previous one, where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" ""Walm"" is directly following both ""wif"" and ""zup,"" again reinforcing the idea of repetition.

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

This example introduces ""bluf"" before ""lug,"" so ""bluf"" isn't directly associated with a color in the output. ""Lug"" still corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" follows it, repeating ""blue"" three times.

Input: dax walm zup lug
Output: green green green yellow blue

""Dax"" results in three repetitions of ""green,"" where ""walm"" immediately follows, likely meaning to repeat ""green"" three times. ""Zup"" and ""lug"" follow their established color patterns.

From these examples, we can deduce the meaning of ""walm"" as follows:

walm -> meaning. Repeat the color that immediately precedes it three times. 

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the sequence, it takes the color associated with the immediately preceding word and outputs it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the provided examples.
Considering the examples given, we might deduce that ""dax"" is associated with the color green every time it appears. However, the fifth example complicates matters as it shows ""dax"" producing a different outcome when combined with other words. The sequence of the fifth input-output pair visually does not immediately reveal a clear pattern, and there's not enough information to definitively determine the rule by which ""dax"" is translated to an output color, especially given that ""dax"" does not always correlate to green here.

Despite the complexity, we can hypothesize a rule based on the available examples:

Rule: ""dax"" correlates to the color green when it is the only word or when it appears in a specific pattern with other words that is not yet fully understood. When the pattern changes, the output associated with ""dax"" can vary, as evidenced by the fifth example. Further information would be necessary to fully understand the conditions under which ""dax"" changes meaning, such as what specific role ""zup,"" ""walm,"" and ""wif"" play in the sequence.

Based on the current examples, the best we can deduce is:
dax -> green (when isolated or in an undetermined context)

Due to the limited data and inconsistency observed in the fifth example, a definitive rule for ""dax"" cannot be determined without additional examples or rules governing the transformation from input to output.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
Based on the given examples, we can determine that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Here is how each example supports this deduction:

- In every example where ""zup"" is present, the corresponding output always includes ""yellow.""
- ""Zup"" does not seem to be contextually dependent on its position in the input sequence, as its position varies but the output ""yellow"" remains constant.
- No other input term consistently maps to the color ""yellow,"" further supporting the unique association between ""zup"" and ""yellow.""

Therefore, we can conclude that:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be directly related to the word that comes immediately before it. To determine the meaning, let's analyze the patterns.

Input: dax bluf wif
Output: green green red

Here, ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"" and the output for both is ""green"".

Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
Output: blue green green yellow blue red

In this string, ""dax"" is again followed by ""bluf"" and both output ""green"". ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" in another instance and both output ""blue"".

Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow

Here, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" and the output for both is ""red"".

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

In this example, ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"" and the output for both is ""yellow"".

Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow

Once again, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output for both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" is ""red"".

It appears that the rule for ""bluf"" is to match the color of the word that comes immediately before it. If there is no word before ""bluf"", then there is no data to deduce its color from.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word immediately preceding it.
Rule: walm -> ""red red""

Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" consistently leads to the output of two consecutive ""red"" in the sequence. Here is how it maps out in the examples:

- Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
  Output: red red green green red red red blue red

- Input: dax wif walm
  Output: green red red red

- Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
  Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

- Input: wif walm
  Output: red red red

- Input: zup wif walm lug
  Output: yellow red red red blue

In every instance where ""walm"" appears, two ""red"" follow in the output, irrespective of the preceding or following words. Therefore, ""walm"" translates into an instruction for two ""red"" in the output sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm
    ",Output: blue red red,blue blue blue,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples given, the word 'lug' consistently corresponds to the color 'blue'. Regardless of position within the input sequence, 'lug' is always translated to 'blue' in the output. 

Other words correspond to different colors, as can be noted through consistency across examples:

- 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'
- 'wif' corresponds to 'red'
- 'dax' corresponds to 'green'
- 'bluf' seems to correspond to 'red' as well, although it is repeated twice in a row in the first example, and 'red' is outputted twice consecutively, indicating that 'bluf' might mean 'red red'.

Rule: lug -> blue
From the given examples, we can infer the meaning of ""dax"" by observing its position and corresponding output color. Here's the analysis:

1. Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue yellow red red green
   Analysis: The first and last word is ""dax,"" corresponding to the first and last colors ""green.""

2. Input: zup bluf lug dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow blue green blue
   Analysis: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" here, which is preceded by ""lug.""

3. Input: wif bluf dax lug
   Output: red red green blue
   Analysis: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" again, which is followed by ""lug.""

4. Input: wif dax zup
   Output: red green yellow
   Analysis: ""dax"" is between ""wif"" and ""zup,"" corresponding to ""green.""

5. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
   Analysis: ""dax"" is between ""wif"" and ""bluf,"" corresponding to ""green.""

In each case, regardless of the position or the words around it, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
Rule: wif -> red

Based on the given examples, wherever the nonce word ""wif"" appears in the input, the output consistently is ""red"". Therefore, ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, regardless of the position of ""wif"" within the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided:

- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green"" when preceded by ""zup""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red"", ""walm"" also translates to ""red red red"" following ""wif""
- ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" when following ""zup"" or ""red"" when following ""wif""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the inputs and outputs provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the color word that comes immediately before it. Whenever ""bluf"" is used, it copies the color that was mentioned just before its occurrence. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the color of the word immediately preceding it. If the word before ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" the color is red. If it's ""lug,"" the color is blue. If it's ""dax,"" the color is green, and if it's ""zup,"" the color is yellow.
The examples suggest that ""walm"" refers to repeating the last color word mentioned three times.

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the last mentioned color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Input: zup dax zup wif walm
    ",Output: yellow green yellow red red red,yellow green yellow red red red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" is directly associated with the color ""blue."" Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the same position in the output. Thus, the rule for the meaning of ""lug"" can be stated as:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the given examples. Each time ""dax"" is mentioned, the output is ""green.""
Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" appears to be consistent across all examples. It always corresponds to the output ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input or the other words present. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".
By analyzing the examples given, we can observe a pattern based on the input and output.

1. Input: lug wif bluf -> Output: blue red red
2. Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green
3. Input: zup bluf wif walm -> Output: yellow yellow red red red
4. Input: wif bluf dax -> Output: red red green
5. Input: dax zup bluf -> Output: green yellow yellow

From these examples, we can infer that the word 'bluf' repeats the color associated with the word preceding it. For instance,

- In example 1, ""lug"" leads to ""blue"" and then ""bluf"" causes ""red"" to repeat.
- In example 2, ""dax"" leads to ""green"" and then ""bluf"" causes ""green"" to repeat.
- In example 3, ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" followed by ""bluf,"" which makes ""yellow"" repeat before ""wif"" leads to ""red"" and ""walm"" causes additional ""red"" repetitions.
- In example 4, ""wif"" leads to ""red"" and ""bluf"" leads to a repetition of ""red"", followed by ""dax"" and another ""green"".
- In example 5, ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" makes ""yellow"" repeat. 

Therefore, according to the pattern, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> It causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" has an effect on the output that follows it. Here is an analysis of each example:

In the first example, after the introduction of ""walm,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated twice.
Input: dax lug dax lug walm
Output: green blue green blue blue blue

In the second example, ""walm"" appears to cause the color ""blue"" to be repeated once.
Input: lug walm wif lug
Output: blue blue blue red blue

In the third example, ""walm"" is followed by the repetition of the color ""yellow"" twice.
Input: zup walm lug wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red

The fourth example shows ""walm"" followed by a repetition of the color ""green"" twice.
Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green

The fifth example shows ""walm"" followed by a repetition of the color ""red"" twice.
Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red

Analyzing the pattern, we can see that ""walm"" causes the color that should come next to repeat according to the color that would have been naturally said if ""walm"" were not there:

- walm after ""dax lug"" leads to a repeat of ""blue.""
- walm after ""zup"" leads to a repeat of ""yellow.""
- walm after ""dax"" leads to a repeat of ""green.""
- walm after ""wif"" leads to a repeat of ""red.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that the word causes the next color mentioned to be repeated twice.

Rule: walm -> causes the next color word to be repeated twice.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position within the sequence.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in each given example.
Reviewing the example inputs and their corresponding outputs consistently shows that the presence of the word ""zup"" translates to the word ""yellow"". There are no instances where ""zup"" correlates with a different color or where its meaning is contextually dependent on other words in the input. Therefore, the rule seems to be the direct substitution of ""zup"" with ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the color ""green"". However, when we look closely, we can see that ""bluf"" matches with the color repeated immediately before it. For example, when ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output is ""red red"", and when it follows ""zup"", the output is ""yellow yellow"". Therefore, ""bluf"" is likely a modifier that indicates the previous color should be repeated.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the previous color in the output.
Based on the outputs tied to the inputs whenever ""walm"" is present, it seems that ""walm"" functions as a rule or command that sets the output color to be consistently the same and aligned with the color associated with the previous word. Inspecting the inputs and corresponding outputs closely:

- Whenever ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" (Input 1, ""zup walm""), the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"", implying that ""walm"" takes the color associated with ""zup"" and maintains it for the following terms.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" (Inputs 3 and 5, ""dax walm""), the output is ""green green green"", showing that ""walm"" once again maintains the color of the preceding word.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" (Input 4, ""lug walm""), the output is ""blue blue blue"", maintaining the color of ""lug.""

In the second input, ""walm"" is at the end after ""wif,"" and the repeated output color is red, consistent with the word right before ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately prior to it for a subsequent number of terms equal to the number of terms following ""walm."" When ""walm"" is the last term, the color repeated is that of the immediately preceding word for an equivalent number of times that word appeared in a sequence (""wif wif walm"" led to a triple ""red"" output).

walm -> meaning. Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" follows another word, it indicates that the color associated with the preceding word should be repeated for the number of terms following ""walm,"" or if ""walm"" is the last term, the color is repeated based on the preceding sequence.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all instances, regardless of its position within the sequence or the surrounding words. Thus, the rule for ""lug"" can be established as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green. There is no variation in the output for ""dax"" across different examples, regardless of the presence or absence of additional nonce words alongside it. Therefore, we can deduce the following:

Rule: dax -> green

Every time ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" maps to the color ""red."" Each instance where ""wif"" occurs in the input, the corresponding output includes the color ""red."" To verify this pattern, we can look at each example individually:

- Input: wif zup - Output: red yellow
  ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

- Input: lug wif dax wif - Output: blue red green red
  ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""wif"" again to ""red"".

- Input: zup lug bluf wif - Output: yellow blue blue red
  ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""bluf"" also to ""blue"" (consistent with other uses of ""lug""), and ""wif"" to ""red"".

- Input: wif dax lug dax - Output: red green blue green
  ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""dax"" to ""green"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""dax"" again to ""green"".

- Input: wif zup walm dax zup - Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
  ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", ""walm"" is adding ""yellow"" without a known input correlating directly so could be part of the listing or repeating pattern for ""zup"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""zup"" again to ""yellow"".

From the above observations, we can formulate the rule:

Rule: wif -> red
From the given examples, we can deduce the meaning of ""zup"" by comparing the input and output sequences to see how ""zup"" affects the color sequence.

1. dax bluf wif zup dax -> green green red yellow green
2. lug zup -> blue yellow
3. lug zup dax lug dax -> blue yellow green blue green
4. zup dax lug wif dax -> yellow green blue red green
5. dax zup -> green yellow

By analyzing the examples:

- ""dax"" correlates with ""green""
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue""
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red""

Looking at the positions where ""zup"" appears, and the color ""yellow"" is in the output, it seems that each instance of ""zup"" directly translates to ""yellow"", regardless of its position or the context provided by other words.

So the rule is:

zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the meaning of ""bluf"" is dependent on the word that precedes it. Let's analyze the pattern:

- When ""zup"" comes before ""bluf"", the output is ""yellow yellow"".
- When ""lug"" comes before ""bluf"", the output is ""blue blue"".
- When ""wif"" comes before ""bluf"", the output is ""red green"".
- The word ""dax"" before ""bluf"" leads to the output ""green green"".

From the patterns observed:

- The word that precedes ""bluf"" determines the first color in the output.
- ""bluf"" itself seems to copy the color indicated by the word just before it.

To codify this into a rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word immediately preceding it, resulting in two instances of that color in the output sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the relationship between the input and the output in each example:

Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red

Analyzing the outputs, we can see the following patterns corresponding to other words:

- ""wif"" always results in ""red red.""
- ""zup"" always results in ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" always results in ""blue.""
- ""dax"" always results in ""green.""

Now, we need to understand how ""walm"" affects the output. In each instance, ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the same color that represents the previous word:

- After ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red,"" suggesting ""walm"" means an additional ""red.""
- After ""zup,"" we see the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating ""walm"" means an additional ""yellow.""
- After ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green,"" suggesting ""walm"" means an additional ""green.""
- After ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue,"" indicating ""walm"" means an additional ""blue.""

Therefore, ""walm"" seems to duplicate the color that precedes it, meaning the rule for ""walm"" is to repeat the color of the word it follows:

Rule: walm -> meaning: repeat the color of the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

4. Input: lug wif lug bluf -> Output: blue red blue blue
5. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red

By analyzing the examples, it appears the output is simply a repetition of the color coded for by the immediately preceding word. Therefore, ""bluf"" should be repeating the color coded by the word that comes just before it. In all examples above, the color right before ""bluf"" appears twice.

Let's put the nonce word ""bluf"" into this context:

""bluf"" -> meaning

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word preceding it in the sequence. So, if the word right before ""bluf"" is coded as ""red,"" then ""bluf"" will output ""red red"". If the word before ""bluf"" is coded as ""blue,"" ""bluf"" will output ""blue blue,"" and so on. 

Therefore, based on the examples provided, the rule is:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> repeat the color associated with the previous word twice.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" we need to examine the patterns in the given examples and identify how the output changes in relation to the positioning of ""walm"" within the input sequences.

From the first input:
Input: lug zup walm lug -> Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

We can observe that the word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" After the word ""walm,"" we see a repetition of the color that immediately precedes it, which in this case is ""yellow.""

From the second input:
Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

Once again, the sequence of colors following ""walm"" replicates the color that comes before it, which is ""yellow."" The subsequent words ""dax"" and ""wif"" correspond to ""green"" and ""red,"" respectively.

From the third input:
Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow

In this case, there is only one color given before ""walm,"" which is ""yellow."" The output once again is a repetition of that color.

From the fourth input:
Input: lug walm wif lug bluf -> Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" followed by ""walm,"" which triggers the repetition of ""blue."" ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" once again corresponds to ""blue."" We do not know what ""bluf"" corresponds to, but we can deduce that it doesn't affect the immediate interpretation of ""walm.""

From the fifth input:
Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow

The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" followed by ""walm,"" which again leads to a repetition of ""red.""

We can determine from these examples that the word ""walm"" causes the color that immediately precedes it to be repeated in the output until a new word appears. Therefore:

Rule: walm -> causes the immediate preceding color to repeat until the next word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug
    ",Output: red blue,red blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in every given example.
Based on the examples provided:

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: dax wif
Output: green red

Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
Output: green green red yellow blue

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

Every example where the word ""dax"" is present, the corresponding output for ""dax"" is ""green."" It seems consistent, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence or the surrounding words. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

dax -> meaning. The meaning of ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green.""
Rule: dax translates to the color green in the output.
From the provided examples, we can induce the following rule based on the consistent presence of the word ""wif"" and corresponding output ""red"":

Rule: wif -> red

Each occurrence of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output.
zup -> meaning. Rule: zup translates to the color ""yellow"".
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" with one exception; when it directly follows the word ""lug"" it means ""blue."" Here is the breakdown of the examples:

1. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
   - Following ""lug"" the word ""bluf"" translates to ""blue.""

2. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow red green red red
   - Here ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" as it does not follow ""lug.""

3. Input: dax bluf wif lug
   Output: green green red blue
   - ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif lug"" but because ""wif lug"" appears after ""bluf"" rather than before it, ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" which matches the output pattern.

4. Input: wif bluf lug
   Output: red red blue
   - ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" when not directly followed by ""lug.""

5. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
   - ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" as it does not follow ""lug.""

Rule: bluf -> ""red"" unless directly followed by ""lug"", then it means ""blue"".
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to correspond to the color blue repeated multiple times. The exact number of times the color is repeated varies depending on its position or usage in the sequence. 

Here is a conjectured rule based on the frequency of the blue color's repetition immediately after the use of ""walm"":

- After ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated once more than the number of times the word ""lug"" appears immediately before ""walm.""

Let's apply this rule to the examples:

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   Rule application: ""lug"" appears once before ""walm,"" so ""blue"" is repeated once more (twice).

2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Rule application: ""lug"" appears once before ""walm,"" so ""blue"" is repeated once more (twice).

3. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   Rule application: ""walm"" is not preceded by ""lug"" the first time, so ""blue"" is not repeated; the second time, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" once, so ""blue"" is repeated once more (twice).

4. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Rule application: ""lug"" appears once before ""walm,"" so ""blue"" is repeated once more (twice).

5. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   Rule application: ""lug"" appears once before ""walm,"" so ""blue"" is repeated once more (twice).

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" can be formulated as:

Rule: walm -> ""blue"" repeated (number of times 'lug' appears directly before 'walm' + 1)

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm
    ",Output: green blue blue,green green green,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the word ""lug"" appears to correspond to the color ""blue"" in each case.

lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever ""lug"" is encountered, it is to be interpreted as ""blue.""
Based on the input and output examples provided, we can infer the following:

Input: dax lug -> Output: green blue
Input: lug wif dax walm zup -> Output: blue red green green green yellow
Input: dax -> Output: green
Input: dax wif -> Output: green red
Input: dax -> Output: green

Every instance where the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
Analyzing the examples provided, here's how the outputs correspond to the inputs with ""wif"" present:

1. Input: wif dax zup walm 
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

2. Input: wif bluf lug zup 
   Output: red red blue yellow

3. Input: wif bluf 
   Output: red red

4. Input: dax wif zup dax 
   Output: green red yellow green

5. Input: zup wif walm lug 
   Output: yellow red red red blue

It appears that whenever ""wif"" is present, the output immediately following ""wif"" is ""red"". In cases where ""wif"" is followed by other words, these words may have their own corresponding output colors, e.g., ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and so on. However, ""wif"" consistently correlates with the color ""red"".

Therefore:

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
Based on the provided examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" can be deduced by looking at the constant output associated with its occurrence in different inputs:

Input: zup
Output: yellow

Input: lug zup dax wif zup
Output: blue yellow green red yellow

Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow

Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
Output: green green red yellow red

Input: lug wif zup wif
Output: blue red yellow red

From these examples, we can determine that regardless of the context in which ""zup"" appears, the output is always ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow. ""Zup"" consistently means the color yellow.
bluf -> the same color as the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" takes the color of the word before it, irrespective of what that color is.
Rule:
walm -> repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times.

Explanation:
- ""dax walm"" means ""green green green"", so ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in ""green"" being said three times.
- ""lug walm"" means ""blue blue blue"", so ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in ""blue"" being said three times.
- ""lug walm dax"" means ""blue blue blue green"", indicating ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""lug"" (blue) three times, followed by the color associated with ""dax"" (green).
- ""lug walm wif bluf"" outputs ""blue blue blue red red"", repeating the ""lug"" color (blue) thrice due to ""walm"" and then following the sequence with two occurrences of the color associated with ""wif"" (red), which is linked to ""bluf.""
- ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" means ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"", implying that ""walm"" after ""zup"" repeats the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow) three times, and the sequence continues normally afterward.

Thus:
walm -> repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Analyzing the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"". In each instance where ""lug"" is presented, it translates to ""blue"" in the output. This consistency across different positions within the sequences suggests that the meaning of ""lug"" is independent of its position or surrounding context. 

Using this information, I can induce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green.""

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce:

1. ""wif"" maps to the color ""red.""
2. Each other word seems to map to a unique color:
   - ""zup"" maps to ""yellow.""
   - ""bluf"" maps to ""yellow.""
   - ""lug"" maps to ""blue.""
   - ""walm"" maps to ""blue.""
   - ""dax"" maps to ""green.""

The repeated colors for different words (""bluf"" and ""zup"" both give ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" and ""walm"" give ""blue"") suggest that the words themselves may not have a one-to-one correspondence with the colors, or there might be further redundancy or rule governing the color mapping which isn't clear from the given examples. However, from the information given, there seems to be consistency with ""wif"" always resulting in ""red.""

So, the rule for ""wif"" is:

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

zup -> meaning

Rule: zup means ""yellow"".
bluf -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", let's examine the occurrences of the word and the corresponding output colors.

From the first example:
Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red
- ""zup"" seems to correspond to yellow, ""wif"" to red, and ""walm"" also to yellow given the repetition.

From the second example:
Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""wif"" to red, ""lug"" to blue, ""zup"" to yellow. ""walm"" falls between the red and red blue, not following the previous assumption.

From the third example:
Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
- Here, ""walm"" is followed by blue twice and then by yellow. It seems to repeat the color before it, contradicting the first observation.

From the fourth example:
Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
- Similar to the first example, with ""walm"" invoking red repetition following ""wif"".

From the fifth example:
Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
- ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it (green from ""dax"" and yellow from ""zup"").

Given these observations, we notice a pattern where ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color output of the word that precedes it. Thus, the created rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the output associated with the previous non-""walm"" word.

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the preceding word's output to repeat.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif walm lug
    ",Output: red red red blue,red red red blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in every given example.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green,"" no matter what other words (lug, walm, wif) are present, and irrespective of its position in the sequence. Thus, it seems that ""dax"" maps directly to the color ""green"" without any dependence on adjacent words or its position in the sequence. 

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif means red. When wif appears in the input, the word red appears in the output at the corresponding position.

Examples:

Input: zup wif bluf zup lug -> Output: yellow red red yellow blue (wif corresponds to the first red)
Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red (wif corresponds to red)
Input: wif -> Output: red (wif corresponds to red)
Input: dax zup walm wif walm -> Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red (wif corresponds to the first red)
Input: dax wif walm lug zup -> Output: green red red red blue yellow (wif corresponds to the first red)

Therefore:

wif -> red.
zup -> yellow. Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" is outputted in the corresponding position in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look at the repeated pattern in the examples provided. It appears that the word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Here's the pattern observed:

Input: zup bluf dax
Output: yellow yellow green
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: wif lug zup bluf
Output: red blue yellow yellow
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
- This is a bit tricky since both words correspond to green, but keeping in mind the other examples, it's safer to maintain that ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""

Input: zup bluf lug zup
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red
- A clear inconsistency appears here, with ""bluf"" corresponding to ""red"" instead of ""yellow.""

Given the inconsistency in the last example, we can deduce that ""bluf"" may usually mean ""yellow"" but also note some context-dependent variability may exist. However, given that 4 out of 5 examples show a direct correspondence, we will assume the last example may contain an error or there is some unknown context-switching rule that is not evident from the given examples.

Rule:
bluf -> yellow (with a possible context-dependent exception observed in one instance)
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the relationship between the input and output across the various examples:

- Input: wif walm | Output: red red red
- Input: dax walm | Output: green green green
- Input: dax zup walm wif walm | Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
- Input: dax walm | Output: green green green
- Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug | Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

From the inputs and outputs, we can make some observations:

1. The word ""walm"" is always followed by a repetition of a color in the output.
2. The color repeated corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" in the input:
   - ""wif"" results in ""red""
   - ""dax"" results in ""green""
   - ""lug"" wasn't directly followed by ""walm"" but seems to correlate with ""blue""
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""

Given these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the color associated with the word that comes directly before it, in a set of three.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The term ""lug"" appears to translate to the color ""blue"" in every example provided. Each time ""lug"" is used in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding output. This pattern holds regardless of the position of ""lug"" in the sequence of words, indicating that ""lug"" consistently means ""blue"".
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we can analyze the patterns and consistency across the given examples. Each example translates to a color sequence, with specific words consistently resulting in the same colors. Let's look at each instance where ""dax"" appears:

1. ""dax zup bluf"" -> green yellow yellow
2. ""dax walm wif"" -> green green green red
3. ""lug wif dax walm zup"" -> blue red green green green yellow
4. ""dax zup lug wif lug"" -> green yellow blue red blue
5. ""zup dax wif"" -> yellow green red

From these examples, we notice that ""dax"" always results in the color green. We also observe that the presence of ""dax"" does not change the resulting color of the words that follow it. For instance, ""zup"" consistently results in yellow and ""wif"" in red when they come after ""dax,"" as they do when they appear before ""dax"" or without it. 

Hence, we can deduce that ""dax"" maps directly to the color green, regardless of its position in a sequence or the context of other words alongside it. So the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples given, we can induce the following rules for the correspondent colors of the nonce words:

- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""walm"" corresponds to the color red repeated three times.
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue, repeated twice assuming based on pattern.

To deduce what ""wif"" means, we look at the examples:

- When ""wif"" is followed by ""zup dax"", the output is red, followed by yellow, then green.
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"", the output is red, followed by red three times.
- When ""wif"" is preceded by ""lug"", the output is red directly after lug's corresponding color blue.
- When ""wif"" is the only word after ""zup"", the output is just yellow, then red.
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""walm lug bluf"", the output includes red (for ""wif""), and then the sequence for ""walm"" (red three times), ""lug"" (blue), and ""bluf"" (blue twice).

From these patterns, we can induce that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red when it appears alone or at the start of a pattern. There is no indication that ""wif"" would result in any other color or any change in pattern regardless of what follows or precedes it.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" appears to be consistent across each instance. No matter the context, whenever ""zup"" is used, the output is ""yellow"". Therefore, it seems that ""zup"" translates directly to the color ""yellow"" without any dependency on surrounding words or context.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> meaning. 

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it. When there is no preceding word, it defaults to red as seen in the second example ""wif bluf"" with the output ""red red,"" suggesting that without a preceding color, ""bluf"" is interpreted as ""red"".

Rule: ""bluf"" assumes the color of the preceding word, or is red by default if there is no preceding word.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to cause the output to repeat the last color mentioned before ""walm"" occurs multiple times. Analyzing the patterns:

1. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   (""wif"" causes ""red""; ""walm"" repeats ""red"" thrice)

2. Input: lug dax walm wif
   Output: blue green green green red
   (""dax"" causes ""green""; ""walm"" repeats ""green"" thrice before ""wif"" changes it to ""red"")

3. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   (""lug"" causes ""blue""; ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" thrice)

4. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue
   (""lug"" causes ""blue""; ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" four times)

5. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   (""zup"" causes ""yellow""; ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times)

The rule for ""walm"" appears to be the repetition of the color produced by the word immediately preceding ""walm."" The number of times the color is repeated seems to be based on the number of times ""walm"" has appeared in the sequence, including the current one, within the same input line.

Rule: walm -> Causes the preceding color to repeat, with the number of repetitions equal to the number of occurrences of ""walm"" in the sequence at that point.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"":

Rule: lug -> blue

Each example that contains the word ""lug"" results in the color ""blue"" being in the output. When ""lug"" is combined with other words, such as ""dax"" or ""zup"", it appears to be separable and retain its meaning (""blue""), while the other words add their respective colors to the sequence. When ""lug"" stands alone, the output is simply ""blue"". This consistency across different contexts supports the rule that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".
Dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in each example provided.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the outputs provided. Each example where ""wif"" is present corresponds to an appearance of ""red"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input string or the other words present.
Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> repeats the color word that immediately precedes it.
Based on the examples provided, we need to identify a pattern that connects the nonce word ""walm"" with the colors given in the outputs.

Let's analyze the examples:

- Input: dax walm zup => Output: green green green yellow
- Input: zup walm => Output: yellow yellow yellow
- Input: lug zup walm lug => Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
- Input: wif dax lug walm => Output: red green blue blue blue
- Input: zup walm => Output: yellow yellow yellow

The word ""walm"" in every input corresponds to multiple occurrences of the same color in the output. Looking at the input immediately before ""walm,"" we can deduce the following rule based on the output:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output color is green.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output color is yellow.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output color is blue.
- ""wif"" has only appeared once and does not precede ""walm"" directly, so we cannot be sure if it affects the color before ""walm.""

We can infer that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word just before it to be repeated in the output. Therefore, ""walm"" seems to mean ""repeat the color associated with the previous word.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever we see the word ""lug"", it should be interpreted or translated as ""blue"".
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" However, it should be noted that the meaning also seems to change depending on the position or the context within the sequence of words. Below are the data points that lead to this conclusion:

1. In the first example, the input ""dax"" directly translates to ""green.""
2. In the subsequent examples, whenever ""dax"" appears, the output includes ""green.""

Since the examples only show ""dax"" corresponding to ""green"" and no other colors or rules are indicated, the simplest rule inducible from these inputs and outputs is:

Rule: dax -> green

The specific position of ""dax"" within the sequence doesn't affect its corresponding color in the output. Thus, no other positional or contextual rules can be inferred from these examples.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif"", let's examine each instance of its use and the corresponding output:

1. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
   'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', 'bluf' to 'yellow', wif to 'red', and 'walm' to 'red red'.
   
2. lug wif lug wif lug -> blue red blue red blue
   'lug' corresponds to 'blue' and 'wif' to 'red'.
   
3. lug dax zup dax walm wif -> blue green yellow green green green red
   'lug' corresponds to 'blue', 'dax' to 'green', 'zup' to 'yellow', 'walm' to 'green green', and 'wif' to 'red'.
   
4. lug wif zup wif -> blue red yellow red
   'lug' corresponds to 'blue', 'wif' to 'red', and 'zup' to 'yellow'.
   
5. wif lug bluf wif zup -> red blue blue red yellow
   'wif' corresponds to 'red', 'lug' to 'blue', 'bluf' to 'blue', and 'zup' to 'yellow'.

From these examples, we can conclude that each instance of 'wif' corresponds to 'red' in the output. Thus, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" we can examine its position and the related output in each example. 

- In every instance the word ""zup"" is used, the color ""yellow"" immediately follows in the output.
- ""zup"" does not seem to affect the colors outputted after ""yellow"" since other words such as ""wif,"" ""dax,"" ""lug,"" and ""bluf"" correspond to other colors that do not consistently come after ""zup."" 
- There is no example that alters the position of ""yellow"" when ""zup"" is present.

Based on this data, ""zup"" directly translates to the color ""yellow"" every time it is used, regardless of its position in the input or the words that follow it.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Analyzing the given examples and their respective outputs, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to a color. ""Bluf"" consistently results in the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""bluf"" within the input sequence or the other words present. There seems to be a direct mapping between the nonce word ""bluf"" and the color ""blue"".

The other words in the input seem to map to different colors as well, for instance:

- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""zup"" -> yellow

Given this pattern, the rule for ""bluf"" is:

Rule: bluf -> blue
Based on the examples provided, let's try to deduce the meaning of ""walm"".

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red

Input: zup walm lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue

Input: lug wif zup wif walm
Output: blue red yellow red red red

From the examples, we see that ""walm"" always results in a sequence of three reds in the output:

- In the first example, ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" and before ""zup wif,"" resulting in ""blue blue blue yellow red.""
- In the third example, ""dax wif walm"" gives us ""green red red red.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup walm lug"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue.""

In all of these cases, ""walm"" corresponds to three reds. The other nonce words (""zup"", ""wif"", ""dax"", and ""lug"") seem to correspond to only a single color each in the output. Given this consistent pattern, the rule appears to be that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of three reds in the output, regardless of its position in the input.

Rule: walm -> three consecutive reds in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup lug walm zup lug
    ",Output: yellow blue red red red yellow blue,yellow blue blue blue yellow blue,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the input-output pairs provided, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" uniformly corresponds to ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, each instance of wif is associated with the color red in the output. This direct association appears consistent regardless of its position in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

- Whenever the word ""zup"" appears, the output is always ""yellow.""
- ""Zup"" does not seem to be context-dependent since it always results in ""yellow,"" no matter its position in the sequence.
- Other words (""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""bluf"") map to different colors (""red,"" ""blue,"" ""green""), and their output is consistent regardless of the presence of ""zup.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule: bluf -> red
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to indicate a repetition of the color associated with the word just before it. For instance, after ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" leads to a repetition of ""yellow."" Similarly, after ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" leads to a repetition of ""green.""

To formalize the rule:

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" indicates that the color word preceding it should be repeated three times. 

In terms of the specific meaning:

walm -> Repeat the preceding color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"". Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output includes the color ""green"". This observation allows us to deduce the meaning of ""dax"" in these examples. 

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples given, it appears that each English word maps to a particular color and ""wif"" consistently maps to the color red. Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: wif -> red.
Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word that precedes it. Here's the breakdown:

- wif bluf -> red red (The color associated with ""wif"" is red, and ""bluf"" repeats it.)
- dax bluf -> green green (The color associated with ""dax"" is green, and ""bluf"" repeats it.)
- zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red (The color sequence is formed by the preceding words, with ""bluf"" repeating the color of the word before it, which is ""wif"" -> red.)
- wif bluf lug -> red red blue (Here, ""bluf"" repeats the red from ""wif"", and it does not affect the following word ""lug."")
- dax bluf -> green green (As before, ""bluf"" repeats the green from ""dax"".)

Rule:
bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, it is possible to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""walm."" In each case, the output for ""walm"" is a series of a color that is repeated three times. Moreover, the color that is repeated corresponds to the color of the word preceding ""walm.""

Here are the interpretations of each example:

Input: zup lug walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue
""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm"" we see ""blue"" repeated three times.

Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm"" we see ""yellow"" repeated three times.

Input: zup dax walm lug wif
Output: yellow green green green blue red
""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""walm"" we see ""green"" repeated three times.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""walm"" we see ""green"" repeated three times.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm"" we see ""yellow"" repeated three times.

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word 'lug' is present in the input, it corresponds to the color 'blue' in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the word 'dax' translates to the color 'green'. Every instance where 'dax' is mentioned in the input, 'green' appears in the corresponding position in the output. No other color is consistently associated with 'dax' across different examples, which indicates that 'dax' does not depend on context but rather has a direct translation.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" regardless of the context. Each example begins with ""wif"" and correspondingly each output begins with ""red."" Furthermore, the addition of other words after ""wif"" results in additional colors being listed in the output.

However, there is insufficient data to deduce a pattern for the other words (""lug,"" ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" ""dax"") and their corresponding colors (""blue,"" ""yellow,"" ""green""). These transformations do not seem to follow a consistent pattern with the current data set, as the word ""bluf"" appears twice but corresponds to two different colors (""yellow"" and ""green""), suggesting that the transformation may depend on the position of the word in the input or other words present.

Given the available examples, our rule would be:

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" The meaning of additional words following ""wif"" cannot be determined with the information provided.
Based on the examples provided, the following rule can be induced:

Rule: zup means ""yellow"".

Each occurrence of the word ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow"". This rule is consistent with all the given inputs. There is not enough information to determine the meanings of ""dax"", ""walm"", or ""wif"", nor is it clear how their presence affects the output alongside ""zup"". However, the request only asks for the meaning of ""zup"", which can be confidently deduced as ""yellow"".
Examining the examples provided, we can look for patterns that connect the nonce word ""bluf"" with the corresponding outputs. Here's the breakdown of examples with the possible translation:

1. Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif  
   Output: red red yellow yellow red  
   - ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red.""
   - ""bluf"" occurs between red and yellow, so it probably corresponds to ""red"" or ""yellow.""

2. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm  
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue  
   - ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""zup"" now looks like it corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and is followed by ""lug,"" and the pattern is ""yellow blue.""
   - ""lug"" is consistently followed by ""blue,"" and ""walm"" seems to extend the sequence of ""blue.""

3. Input: zup lug bluf  
   Output: yellow blue blue  
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

4. Input: zup lug bluf wif  
   Output: yellow blue blue red  
   - The same correlation as previous examples holds for ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif.""
   - ""Bluf"" again follows ""lug.""

5. Input: dax bluf  
   Output: green green  
   - ""dax"" must correspond to ""green.""
   - ""bluf"" also appears to correspond to ""green"" in this case.

By matching each instance of ""bluf"" with the colors in the outputs, we can conclude that ""bluf"" assumes the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Therefore, when ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" or ""zup,"" it's ""red"" or ""yellow,"" respectively. Following ""lug,"" ""bluf"" is ""blue,"" and after ""dax,"" it is ""green.""

Rule:
bluf -> The meaning of bluf is the same color as the word that comes before it.
From the given examples, we can analyze the pattern on either side of the nonce word ""walm"" to deduce its meaning. 

In each example, the color output that occurs multiple times consecutively corresponds to the words adjacent to ""walm."" Here are the examples with this pattern highlighted:

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red green
Pattern: dax corresponds to green, and it's repeated three times before a different color appears.

Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
Pattern: zup lug corresponds to blue blue and both are repeated before a different color, in this case, yellow, appears.

Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow
Pattern: dax corresponds to green, and it's repeated three times before a different color, yellow, appears.

Input: lug walm wif
Output: blue blue blue red
Pattern: lug corresponds to blue, and it's repeated three times before a different color, red, appears.

Input: zup walm dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow green
Pattern: zup corresponds to yellow, and it's repeated three times before a different color, green, appears.

Based on this pattern, ""walm"" seems to mean ""repeat the color of the previous word three times"". Therefore, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color denoted by the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm
    ",Output: green green green,green green green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning: blue

Rule: Each time the word ""lug"" is presented in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue.""
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following rules for the output colors associated with each input word:

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> red
- lug -> blue
- walm -> red

These rules are consistent across all examples provided. Now, to determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we analyze its output in different contexts:

1. wif dax -> red green
2. wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
3. dax lug zup dax -> green blue yellow green
4. wif bluf lug dax wif -> red red blue green red
5. dax wif walm -> green red red red

By cross-examining the input-output pairs where ""dax"" is used, we can infer that ""dax"" is associated with the color green every time it is used in the input, regardless of its position or the context within the sequence of words.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green

Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following:

Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
Input: wif zup -> Output: red yellow
Input: wif -> Output: red
Input: zup dax wif -> Output: yellow green red

It seems that the word ""wif"" always translates to the color ""red"" in the output. Additionally, it appears in the same position in the output as it does in the input, relative to the other words. Other words translate to different colors (e.g., ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green""), but ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" is:

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> blue

Based on the given examples, whenever the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue"", regardless of the position or the other words present. This suggests that ""bluf"" translates directly to the color ""blue.""
Based on the given examples, we will analyze the role of the word ""walm"" and how it seems to affect the output. To start, we will look for patterns in the input and corresponding output:

1. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   - Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output is three greens. 

2. Input: lug wif zup wif walm
   Output: blue red yellow red red red
   - Here ""walm"" is at the end, after ""wif"" and the output is a repetition of red.

3. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   - Once again, the sequence ""dax walm"" appears and results in three greens.

4. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green 
   - Here we see ""dax walm"" twice, and both instances are followed by a series of greens.

5. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green
   - ""dax walm"" results in a series of greens again.

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" following ""dax"" leads to a series of three greens in the output. Additionally, when ""walm"" is at the end following ""wif"", the output is a repetition of red. 

No example explicitly isolates ""walm"" in a fashion that allows us to understand its meaning without the words around it. Therefore, from the existing data, we can suggest that ""walm"" is dependent on the previous word(s) for its meaning, at least in part. Specifically:

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output seems to consistently be three greens.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output seems to be red, with the number of reds dependent on the total number of ""wif""s in the input sequence (2 ""wifs"" before ""walm"" produce 3 reds, and 1 ""wif"" produces 1 red).

We might therefore deduce a pattern or rule based on the given examples:

Rule: ""walm"" following ""dax"" results in ""green green green"" in the output. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is a sequence of reds where the number of reds seems to be one more than the number of occurrences of ""wif"" before ""walm"".

To assert this rule with higher confidence, more data would be needed, especially examples where ""walm"" follows other words, or is followed by additional context.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples provided, every time the nonce word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output consistently includes the color ""green."" Regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence or the words around it, the output invariably contains ""green."" Hence, we can deduce that ""dax"" means ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" seems to result in the color ""red."" Hence, each instance of ""wif"" is directly translated into ""red."" There is no clear context given that alters the meaning of ""wif"" based on position or surrounding words. All instances consistently translate to the same color regardless of their position in the input sequence. Additionally, no other word in the examples consistently translates to red. Therefore, there is sufficient evidence to deduce the meaning of ""wif"" as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence. This suggests that ""zup"" is not context-dependent and consistently means the same thing in each example.

Hence, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> the color word that corresponds to the color of the word immediately preceding it. If ""bluf"" comes after ""lug,"" which corresponds to the color blue, then ""bluf"" also corresponds to blue. If it comes after ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, then ""bluf"" also corresponds to yellow.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word 'walm' corresponds to the repetition of the last color mentioned before it. To confirm this, let's examine the examples.

In the first example, 'dax' results in 'green' and after 'walm', we get 'green green green'. In the second example, 'walm' comes after 'zup,' which corresponds to 'yellow', and the output is 'yellow yellow yellow'. This pattern continues in the other examples, where 'walm' repeats the color output of the last word before it.

Therefore, based on the examples provided, the rule for 'walm' is:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

In the first example, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

- Input: zup dax zup wif
- Output: yellow green yellow red

In the second example, ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red,"" maintaining consistency with the first example.

- Input: zup wif lug

The fourth example shows ""wif"" alone, and it still corresponds to ""red.""

- Input: wif bluf
- Output: red red

Finally, the fifth example does not break the pattern, as ""wif"" is once more associated with ""red.""

Taking all these instances into account, we can confidently establish that ""wif"" directly translates to the color ""red.""

    Rules:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples:

Input: wif 
Output: red 
- Single word wif corresponds to red.

Input: wif walm dax zup 
Output: red red red green yellow 
- The sequence starts with wif and the sequence corresponds to red red red green yellow.

Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif 
Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red 
- The sequence ends with wif and the sequence corresponds to yellow blue blue yellow yellow red.

Input: zup wif 
Output: yellow red 
- The sequence contains zup followed by wif and corresponds to yellow red.

Input: lug dax bluf wif dax 
Output: blue green green red green 
- The sequence contains wif in the fourth position and corresponds to blue green green red green.

From these observations, we can deduce that irrespective of position or surrounding words, wif always corresponds to red.

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the provided examples, it seems that there is a pattern in the color outputs related to the position and combination of the words preceding ""bluf."" Let's analyze the examples:

1. wif bluf dax walm ->
   Output: red red green green green
   - Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and is followed by a different word ""dax,"" which seems to change the color output for ""wif"" to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

2. dax bluf ->
   Output: green green
   - In this case, ""bluf"" follows ""dax."" Since ""dax"" is green in every instance, the rules for ""dax"" seem independent of ""bluf."" However, ""bluf"" also takes the color green.

3. dax zup lug bluf ->
   Output: green yellow blue blue
   - Here, ""bluf"" is the fourth word and is green, while ""dax"" is always green. ""zup"" is yellow and ""lug"" is blue, which is consistent with the fifth example.

4. zup dax zup dax wif bluf ->
   Output: yellow green yellow green red red
   - In this sequence, the pattern shows that ""zuf"" and ""dax"" retain their colors, and ""wif"" before ""bluf"" turns ""wif"" to ""red"" and ""bluf"" to ""red.""

5. zup wif bluf zup lug ->
   Output: yellow red red yellow blue
   - With the ""wif bluf"" sequence, both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" are red, while ""zup"" and ""lug"" have their individual colors.

From these observations, a rule for ""bluf"" could be determined as follows:

If ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" become red; otherwise, ""bluf""'s own color appears to be green. However, since the word ""bluf"" is not followed by a green output in any of the instances, it might suggest ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word or influences the color change of the word before it:

Rule: When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output color is red for both words. Otherwise, ""bluf"" takes on the green color unless it influences the word before it to change color.

In other words, ""bluf"" potentially reflects or dictates the color of the output based on its position and the word that precedes it. The rule of ""bluf"" influencing the word before it is only shown with ""wif,"" and in other cases, ""bluf"" itself results in green. More examples would be needed to solidify this rule.
Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule of the nonce word ""walm"" within the context of sequences of colors. We will look at the patterns and the surrounding words to decipher the rule.

1. Input: zup lug walm -> Output: yellow blue blue blue
2. Input: dax walm wif dax -> Output: green green green red green
3. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
4. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
5. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

From the examples, we can observe that ""walm"" generates a sequence where the following color(s) repeat and it seems to repeat the color corresponding to the word just before ""walm"".

In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and after ""walm"", we have three ""blue"".

In the second example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and after ""walm"", we get three ""green"" before another word ""wif"" appears.

We can also notice that the repetition continues until a new different color word appears, which then breaks the sequence. This new word continues to appear twice after ""walm"" stops repeating the preceding color.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the color of the word that precedes it to repeat until a different color word is encountered. This new word is repeated twice.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color associated with the word that comes just before ""walm"" to repeat until a different color word appears. The next new color word is then repeated twice.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever 'lug' appears in the input, it translates to a single occurrence of 'blue' in the output. If 'lug' is followed by 'walm,' then 'walm' translates to additional 'blue' occurrences, resulting in a string of 'blue.' The number of 'blue' repetitions is one greater than the number of times 'walm' directly follows 'lug' in the input.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce a pattern for ""dax"" by analyzing the consistent relationships between the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Here is the breakdown of the examples to find the rule for ""dax"":

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output.
2. ""dax"" does not seem to directly depend on the position in the sequence (it can be at the beginning, middle, or end), as its output is consistently ""green"" regardless of its position.
3. No other word in the inputs consistently translates to the output ""green.""

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""dax"" translates to ""green"" regardless of its position or the surrounding words.
From examining the given input-output pairs, one can infer the following patterns for words and their corresponding colors:

- ""wif"" always translates to ""red"".
- ""zup"" always translates to ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" always translates to ""blue"".
- ""dax"" always translates to ""green"".
- ""walm"" is consistently ""blue"" in the given examples.

With these patterns in mind, it appears that each nonce word is a direct stand-in for a color word, and ""wif"" in particular is a stand-in for the color ""red"". Thus:

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each instance of ""zup"" in the inputs results in ""yellow"" in the outputs, regardless of the order or the words that surround it.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare each Input with its corresponding Output:

1. wif lug zup bluf -> red blue yellow yellow
2. dax bluf wif zup wif -> green green red yellow red
3. wif bluf lug -> red red blue
4. wif bluf -> red red
5. lug dax bluf -> blue green green

From the examples, we can observe that ""bluf"" follows a pattern with these rules:
- If ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", it translates to ""red"".
- If ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" or ""dax"", it translates to ""green"".
- ""bluf"" never appears before any word with a corresponding colored output, viewing it strictly as a consequence, not a lead-in.

Given these observations, the word ""bluf"" translates to the color of the word that precedes it. It doesn't have a standalone color; instead, its color depends on the word that comes directly before it.

Rule: bluf -> The color of the preceding word.
To deduce what ""walm"" means, we have to look at each of the example inputs and their corresponding outputs for patterns that could give us clues. Let's break down each input/output sequence and identify how ""walm"" could be influencing the output.

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   - Here, ""wif"" comes before ""walm"" and the output is ""red red"".
   - After ""walm"" comes ""dax"" and the output is ""red green"".
   - ""Zup"" follows and the output is ""yellow"".

2. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   - ""Walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""dax"", the outputs are ""blue blue"".
   - The next ""dax"" after ""walm"" gives a ""blue green"" output.
   - Then ""wif"" leads to ""red"" and ""bluf"" leads to ""red"".

3. Input: wif walm zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
   - The output pattern repeats ""red"" with ""wif"" before ""walm"" and continues ""red"" after ""walm"".
   - ""Zup"" after ""walm"" results in a ""yellow"".
   - Another ""walm"" without a word after it still outputs ""yellow"".

4. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   - ""Zup"" leads to ""yellow"" and is followed by ""walm"" with another ""yellow"".
   - After ""walm"" comes ""dax"" which results in ""green"".

5. Input: lug dax walm wif
   Output: blue green green green red
   - ""Lug"" leads to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green"".
   - ""Walm"" follows and we have another ""green"".
   - Finally, ""wif"" after ""walm"" results in ""red"".

After examining the examples and considering the positions of ""walm"" and the resulting colors, there's no obvious single meaning or rule that can be directly associated with ""walm"". It seems as though ""walm"" is affecting the output, but not always in a consistent manner. However, there is one pattern that stands out:

It appears that ""walm"" results in the output color that would directly follow from the preceding word, regardless of what ""walm"" itself might be aimed to represent. For instance, after ""wif"" the color is ""red""; so ""walm"" after ""wif"" also yields ""red"". After ""lug,"" the color is ""blue,"" so ""walm"" after ""lug"" produces another ""blue."" It seems to mimic the color output associated with the word before it:

Rule: The word ""walm"" duplicates the output color of the preceding word.

Therefore, ""walm"" -> duplicates the output color of the word before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug wif
    ",Output: green blue red,green blue red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that the output generates a sequence of colors corresponding to each input word. Each input word seems to be mapped to a specific color consistently in each output. For instance, every time ""walm"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output, and every time ""dax"" appears, ""green"" follows in the output.

To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" let's analyze the outputs where it occurs:

1. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue
   Here, ""walm"" corresponds to the second instance of ""blue"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". ""Lug"" appears at the beginning and end, with ""blue"" occurring at the beginning of the output sequence and at the end, suggesting that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

2. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   ""Dax"" is ""green"", ""walm"" is ""blue"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"", and after ""zup"", there is a ""lug"" translated as ""blue"" in the output.

3. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue
   ""Wif"" is consistently ""red"" and the remaining color ""blue"" must correspond to ""lug"".

4. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   ""Zup"" is ""yellow"", ""walm"" is ""blue"", and ""lug"" corresponds to the other ""blue"" in the output.

5. Input: lug dax zup dax wif
   Output: blue green yellow green red
   ""Dax"" is ""green"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""wif"" is ""red"", and the remaining ""blue"" at the beginning corresponds to ""lug"".

From these observations, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, the word 'wif' appears to correlate consistently with the color 'red'. No matter what word precedes or follows 'wif', the output after 'wif' is always 'red'. The other words such as 'lug', 'dax', and 'bluf' have different corresponding colors, but 'wif' is unchanging in its association. Therefore, the rule for 'wif' can be deduced as follows:

Rule: wif -> 'red'
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" I'll analyze the correlation between the input and output pairs. 

Looking at the first example:
Input: zup walm lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue

All three instances of ""zup"" are followed by the word ""yellow"" in the output, with another word, ""lug,"" being followed by ""blue."" This suggests that ""zup"" might correspond to ""yellow.""

To test this hypothesis, let's examine the second example:
Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Again, every instance of ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"" in the output. Other words do not consistently map to ""yellow,"" so this supports the hypothesis that ""zup"" represents ""yellow.""

Let's consider the third example:
Input: dax walm wif zup
Output: green green green red yellow

Here, ""zup"" appears at the end and again corresponds to ""yellow,"" further supporting the hypothesis.

For the fourth example:
Input: dax lug zup
Output: green blue yellow

Here, ""zup"" is the last word and once again correlates with ""yellow.""

Finally, in the fifth example:
Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

The word ""zup"" appears first and corresponds to ""yellow."" The pattern continues to hold.

Considering all the examples, it seems clear that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" as each occurrence of ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow"" in the output, and this remains consistent across all given examples, regardless of the position of ""zup"" within the input string.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> blue

Rule: The word ""bluf"" in the examples corresponds to the color blue in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" takes on the color attribute of the word immediately preceding it and repeats that color an additional two times. Here's a breakdown of each example and its output to explain the rule:

1. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats this color three times.

2. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" so ""walm"" takes this color and repeats it three times.

3. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" so ""walm"" takes this color and repeats it three times.

4. Input: lug wif zup wif walm
   Output: blue red yellow red red red
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and as ""walm"" follows this last ""wif,"" it takes ""red"" and repeats it three times.

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" so ""walm"" repeats the color three times.

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the word before it and repeats that color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif zup dax
    ",Output: green red yellow green,green red yellow green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" is associated with a color output each time it is mentioned in the input. To understand the underlying rule, let's analyze the examples line by line:

1. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" while ""wif"" and ""walm"" both correspond to ""red"".

2. Input: lug wif dax
   Output: blue red green
   ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green"", ""wif"" remains ""red"", and ""lug"" is ""blue"".

3. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red
   ""dax"" leads with ""green"", followed by ""wif"" which is ""red"".

4. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue
   ""dax"" precedes ""green"" and it follows that ""walm"" now also correlates with ""green"", while ""lug"" stays as ""blue"".

5. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow
   ""dax"" stands for ""green"", ""wif"" and ""walm"" for ""red"", ""lug"" for ""blue"", and a new word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

From these examples, it appears that ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the list.

Rule: dax -> green.
Rule:
wif -> red

Explanation: Each instance of the nonce word ""wif"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output. No matter the position or surrounding words, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to map to a repetition of the immediately preceding color in the translation. Let's verify this rule by examining the examples:

1. Input: zup lug zup **bluf** lug
   Output: yellow blue yellow **yellow** blue
   ""Bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" as well.

2. Input: dax wif **bluf**
   Output: green red **red**
   ""Bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which translates to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" too.

3. Input: lug walm wif lug **bluf**
   Output: blue blue blue red **blue blue**
   ""Bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" repeated twice, matching the double occurrence of ""lug.""

4. Input: dax **bluf** zup
   Output: green **green** yellow
   ""Bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which translates to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" translates to ""green.""

5. Input: zup walm lug wif **bluf**
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue **red red**
   ""Bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which translates to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" twice, like the preceding ""wif.""

Rule: bluf -> a repetition of the color translated from the word immediately before bluf. If the word before bluf appears once, bluf translates to the same color once. If the word before bluf appears more than once, bluf translates to the repeated color the same number of times as the preceding word.
From the provided examples, each occurrence of the word ""walm"" is translated into three of the same color in the output. Here are the observed patterns:

- ""zup walm wif"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow red"", where 'zup' correlates to 'yellow', 'wif' to 'red', and 'walm' represents three 'yellow'.
- ""zup dax walm zup wif"" turns into ""yellow green green green yellow red"", with 'dax' matching 'green' and 'walm' again causing a triplet of the preceding color, which is 'green' in this case.
- ""zup walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow"", once more showing that 'walm' turns into three 'yellow' because 'zup' precedes it.
- ""zup walm lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue"", where 'lug' is 'blue', furthering the pattern that 'walm' becomes three of whatever color is signified by the word right before it.
- ""dax walm"" converts to ""green green green"", aligning with the established rule that 'walm' is three of whatever color 'dax' represents, which is 'green'.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the output of three consecutive instances of the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug dax wif walm
    ",Output: red blue green red red red,red blue green red red red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: The non-word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in every instance where it appears.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples provided where every instance of ""dax"" leads to the output ""green,"" we can conclude that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Here is the breakdown:

- In all instances where ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. 
- No other word in the input consistently corresponds to ""green"" in the output across all examples.
- The position of ""dax"" in the input does not affect the output; it always results in ""green,"" regardless of whether it appears at the beginning, middle, or end of the sequence. 

Therefore, the rule inferred is that ""dax"" means ""green.""
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we should look at each example and find common patterns or rules related to the word's presence and the corresponding colors in the output.

Here are the observations from the examples:

1. When ""dax"" follows ""wif,"" the word afterward is ""bluf,"" and the outputs are ""green red red,"" suggesting that ""dax"" corresponds to green when following ""wif,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to red.

2. ""wif"" on its own corresponds to red.

3. When ""wif"" precedes ""lug,"" the output for ""lug"" is blue.

4. ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" then ""dax"" results in ""red red red green,"" which is consistent with ""wif"" being red, ""walm"" also being red, and ""dax"" following ""wif"" being green.

With these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""wif"" appears to be a placeholder for the color red. When ""wif"" is present, it turns into ""red"" in the output. Additionally, the presence of ""wif"" determines the color for the words that follow; for example, ""dax"" turns green after ""wif,"" ""bluf"" is consistently red, and ""lug"" is blue after ""wif.""

Thus, we can make the following deduction:

wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we should look for patterns in the given input-output pairs. Analyzing each input for where ""zup"" appears and comparing it to the corresponding output can provide insights into the possible rule it follows. 

Let's examine the outputs whenever ""zup"" appears in the input:

1. When ""zup"" appears at the beginning:
   - Input: zup dax walm -> Output: yellow green green green
   - Input: zup walm dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
   - Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
   - Input: zup lug walm wif dax -> Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

2. When ""zup"" appears in the middle:
   - Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug (second occurrence of zup) -> Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

Observations:
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
- The presence of ""zup"" does not appear to affect the color translation of the words following it.

Rule:
zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the color that follows the word immediately before it.

Example analysis:

- Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
  Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
  
- Input: wif bluf
  Output: red red
  
- Input: wif lug bluf
  Output: red blue blue
  
- Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
  Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow
  
- Input: wif bluf
  Output: red red
  
In every case, the output for ""bluf"" is the same as the color word that comes immediately before it in the input.

Rule: bluf -> the color word that precedes it.
From the examples given, it seems that ""walm"" maps to a sequence of the word ""red"" in the output. In each example, the presence of ""walm"" correlates with one or more instances of ""red"". The number of times ""red"" appears is the same as the number of words that follow ""walm"" in the input.

Here's the breakdown:

- Input: dax wif walm lug zup -> Output: green red red red blue yellow
""red"" appears three times, which corresponds to the three words after ""walm"" in the input.

- Input: dax wif walm -> Output: green red red red
""red"" appears three times, with no words following ""walm"".

- Input: zup dax lug walm zup -> Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
""red"" does not appear and there's one word following ""walm"".

- Input: lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue
""red"" appears three times, with no words following ""walm"".

- Input: zup lug walm -> Output: yellow blue blue blue
""red"" appears three times, with no words following ""walm"".

By examining these patterns, we observe a deviation in the third example that doesn't seem to follow the established rule. This may suggest a mistake, or that the rule may be more complex than initially deduced.

However, based on the most consistent pattern observed in the first, second, fourth, and fifth examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> ""red"" repeated for every word that follows ""walm"" in the input. If no words follow ""walm"", the output is three instances of ""red"". 

Given the inconsistency in example three, further examples or information would be needed to solidify the rule without ambiguity.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the nonce word ""lug"" translates as the color ""blue"" in the outputs. Here is the rule illustrated through the examples:

Input: lug zup dax wif
Output: blue yellow green red
Translation: lug -> blue

Input: lug wif zup wif walm
Output: blue red yellow red red red
Translation: lug -> blue

Input: lug zup
Output: blue yellow
Translation: lug -> blue

Input: lug zup
Output: blue yellow
Translation: lug -> blue

Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
Output: red red yellow red blue green
Translation: lug -> blue

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in all given examples.
Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Each subsequent real word translates to a color, with ""bluf"" translating to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The word ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word that follows it. 

wif -> red
bluf -> red
dax -> green
lug -> blue
walm -> repeat color of next word

Additional rule explanation: When ""wif"" is presented alone, the output is simply ""red."" When followed by other nonce words, each of those words is translated into a corresponding color or modifies the translation of the following word, as per the given examples.
Rule: zup -> yellow
From the given examples, we can observe that each time the word ""bluf"" appears, the output is ""red."" It suggests that ""bluf"" translates to the color red, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, we can deduce:

bluf -> red. 

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" from the given examples, let's analyze the outputs and see what pattern is associated with the word ""walm"". 

- In the first example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue blue"". Here, ""lug"" is consistently translated to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red"", while ""bluf"" is ""blue"" at the end of the sequence. Notably, immediately after ""walm"", the color ""blue"" is repeated three times, suggesting a repeating effect.

- In the second example, ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" becomes ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"". ""zup"" seems to consistently translate to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" to ""blue"" again. Following ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times, indicating a similar repeating pattern.

- In the third example, ""dax wif walm"" turns into ""green red red red"". Here, ""dax"" appears to mean ""green"" and ""wif"" again translates to ""red"". After ""walm"", ""red"" is repeated three times.

- In the fourth example, ""dax walm zup walm"" produces ""green green green yellow yellow yellow"". Again, a repeating pattern occurs after each occurrence of ""walm"", with ""green"" and ""yellow"" each being repeated three times after their respective ""walm"".

- In the fifth example, ""zup wif walm"" becomes ""yellow red red red"". Similar to previous examples, following ""walm"" we see a repetition of ""red"" three times.

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be as follows:

""**walm**"" indicates that the color word that immediately precedes it should be repeated three times in the output.

Thus, the rule can be defined as:
walm -> Repeat the preceding color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif bluf lug walm dax lug dax
    ",Output: red red blue blue blue green blue green,red red blue blue blue green blue green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
From the examples provided, we can see that the occurrence of the word ""lug"" consistently maps to the color ""blue"" in the output. There doesn't appear to be any additional context that changes this mapping; ""lug"" always results in ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input string or the other words around it. Therefore, we can conclude the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" consider its usage and output in each example:

Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
- Here, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and is followed by ""green."" Thus, ""dax"" could mean or represent ""green,"" or it may indicate to repeat the color associated with the following word.

Input: dax lug dax
Output: green blue green
- ""dax"" is followed by ""lug"" and then again by ""dax."" The output is ""green blue green,"" which suggests that ""dax"" represents ""green,"" and that it repeats the color representation of the word following it.

Input: dax zup lug wif lug
Output: green yellow blue red blue
- ""dax"" precedes ""zup,"" which is followed by ""yellow"" in the output. Since ""lug"" is represented by ""blue,"" and ""wif"" is not preceded by ""dax"" but results in ""red,"" which is new, ""dax"" seems to be related to the repetition of the color but doesn't create a representation for ""wif.""

Input: dax
Output: green
- ""dax"" alone gives ""green,"" which reinforces that ""dax"" directly refers to ""green.""

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
- ""bluf"" does not have a known representation from the previous examples, but it is preceded by ""dax"" and results in another ""green."" This supports the idea that ""dax"" directly means ""green"" and does not necessarily depend on the word that follows it, but can still influence it by repetition.

Based on the above examples, it is consistent to conclude that ""dax"" means ""green"" or represents the color green alone or before other words.

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color red in each provided example, regardless of its position within the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""zup"" corresponds directly to the color ""yellow"". 

Every time ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output in the corresponding position. There is no variation in this pattern across the examples given, thus it indicates a direct translation.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples given, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of the word ""bluf"":

Whenever the word ""bluf"" appears in an input, it is followed by a color in the output. The color that follows ""bluf"" in the output is the same as the color that corresponds to the word just before ""bluf"" in the input. Here are the mappings from the given inputs to the outputs:

- ""dax"" maps to ""green""
- ""wif"" maps to ""red""
- ""lug"" maps to ""blue""
- ""zup"" maps to ""yellow""

Applying the rule to each of the examples:

1. ""dax bluf"" leads to ""green green""
2. ""lug bluf"" leads to ""blue blue""
3. ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red""
4. ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow""
5. ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red"" (again)

Therefore, the rule is that ""bluf"" means to repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.
Based on the provided examples, we can identify a pattern that shows that the word ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color that immediately precedes it three times. Here is how it applies in each example:

Input: wif walm
""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
Output: red red red
- ""wif walm"" translates to ""red"" followed by ""walm,"" which repeats the preceding color, ""red,"" three times.

Input: zup dax walm lug wif
""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
Output: yellow green green green blue red
- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green"" followed by ""walm,"" which repeats the preceding color, ""green,"" three times.

Input: zup wif walm
""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
Output: yellow red red red
- ""wif walm"" translates to ""red"" followed by ""walm,"" which repeats the preceding color, ""red,"" three times.

Input: dax walm wif walm
""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
Output: green green green red red red
- The first ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and repeats ""green"" three times.
- The second ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and repeats ""red"" three times.

Input: dax walm zup lug
""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
Output: green green green yellow blue
- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green"" followed by ""walm,"" which repeats the preceding color, ""green,"" three times.
- The next words do not include ""walm,"" so they just correspond to their own colors.

Rule: walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the immediately preceding color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" let's examine each instance and the corresponding outputs.

1. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   
   Here, the appearance of ""lug"" corresponds to the color change from ""green"" to ""yellow.""

2. Input: dax lug
   Output: green blue
   
   ""Dax"" precedes ""lug"" as in the previous example, where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" but now ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" not ""yellow"" as before.

3. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
   
   This implies that ""lug"" alone corresponds to ""blue"" in this context.

4. Input: wif bluf dax lug
   Output: red red green blue
   
   Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" follows as ""blue.""

5. Input: zup dax lug zup
   Output: yellow green blue yellow
   
   ""Lug"" comes after ""dax"" again, and it corresponds to ""blue,"" while ""zup"" before and after corresponds to ""yellow.""

From the above examples, we can see two patterns:

- ""Lug"" generally corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- The exception in the first example indicates a possible contextual dependency or a single mistake in the pattern.

Rule: It appears that ""lug"" generally means ""blue"" unless there's a contextual reason for it not to, which is not clearly indicated in these examples. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Let's verify this by looking at each input and output pair:

1. Input: wif dax wif lug wif
   Output: red green red blue red
   Here, every occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

2. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
   Output: green red green yellow yellow
   The single occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

3. Input: wif bluf lug
   Output: red red blue
   Again, ""wif"" is associated with ""red.""

4. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   The one instance of ""wif"" aligns with ""red.""

5. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red
   The sequence with ""wif"" ends with the word ""red.""

In conclusion, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
From the given examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to affect the color associated with the word that follows it. When we see ""bluf,"" the output is the color normally associated with the subsequent word. Let's analyze the examples.

- In the first example, ""zup bluf dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow green,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" kept the color of ""dax,"" which follows it, the same (green).
- The second example shows ""lug bluf dax lug,"" translating to ""blue blue green blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""dax"" results in the color associated with ""lug"" again (blue), then changes the next word ""dax"" to its associated color (green).
- The third example, ""lug wif bluf,"" translates to ""blue red red,"" which shows that the word after ""bluf"" does not change color (remains red, which is associated with ""wif"").
- The fourth example, ""dax bluf zup,"" translates to ""green green yellow,"" again suggesting ""bluf"" causes the subsequent word to retain its color (green, then yellow).
- The fifth example, ""lug bluf wif,"" translates to ""blue blue red,"" corroborating the observation that ""bluf"" results in the same color as the word right afterwards.

Based on this, the rule is that ""bluf"" results in the color associated with the word that follows it, essentially mirroring that color. The exception is when ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" after which the sequence continues to the next color as per the word after ""bluf."" This suggests a specific rule when ""dax"" follows ""bluf,"" holding the color of ""bluf"" the same as the previous word.

The pattern appears to be that ""bluf"" directly copies the color of the word that follows it unless ""dax"" is immediately after ""bluf,"" in which case it seems to take the color from the previous word. However, the ""bluf dax"" rule is not consistently clear due to limited examples.

Rule: bluf -> When ""bluf"" is followed by any word, the output is the color associated with that word except when followed by ""dax,"" which may take the color of the preceding term or follows an exception not clearly defined with these examples.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's observe the patterns in color output for each example.

Input: dax walm zup lug walm
Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

This line suggests that ""dax"" inputs command the output ""green green green,"" ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" leads to a sequence of ""blue blue blue."" The word ""walm"" is associated with repetitions of the preceding color.

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color output associated with ""wif.""

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Again, ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" twice more.

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green

Here ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" ""walm"" repeats ""red,"" and ""dax"" changes the output to ""green.""

Input: wif walm zup walm
Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow

Here ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" ""walm"" repeats ""red,"" ""zup"" changes the output to ""yellow,"" and the following ""walm"" repeats ""yellow.""

Observing the examples, it seems that ""walm"" is associated with the repetition of the color output of the word that directly precedes it, and it repeats the color output three times, corresponding to the number of letters in ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> repeats the color output of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif
    ",Output: green red,green red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To determine the meaning of ""lug,"" we'll need to look at the pattern in the inputs and outputs to see how ""lug"" influences the resulting colors.

Here are the patterns based on the given examples:

1. Whenever ""lug"" appears after ""wif,"" the output color is blue.
2. ""lug"" does not always appear in the same position, so its meaning likely depends on context.

Now let's analyze this step by step using the examples:

Example 1:
Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
- Before ""lug"" we have ""wif,"" and the output is blue.

Example 2:
Input: dax bluf wif lug
Output: green green red blue
- Again ""wif"" is before ""lug,"" and the output is blue.

Example 3:
Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green
- ""wif"" is before ""lug,"" and the output directly after ""lug"" is blue.

Example 4:
Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
Output: yellow yellow red blue green
- Same pattern, ""wif"" before ""lug"" and the output is blue.

Example 5:
Input: dax wif lug dax
Output: green red blue green
- ""wif"" appears before ""lug"" and the output is blue.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""lug"" is likely to represent the color blue when it comes after ""wif."" 

Rule: lug -> When ""lug"" occurs after ""wif,"" the output is blue.
Based on the examples provided, each occurrence of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the output color ""green"". When ""lug"" comes after ""dax"", the output is ""green blue""; however, when ""lug"" comes before ""dax"", the output is ""blue green"", suggesting the order in which these words appear affects the corresponding color output. Without more examples providing variations for ""dax"" with different following or preceding words, it is not possible to determine further rules applicable to ""dax"" in combination with other words. Nevertheless, when ""dax"" stands alone or is not influenced by adjacent words, it reliably corresponds to the color ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" corresponds to a specific color output, which is independent of its position in the input sequence. In all provided cases, the output color for ""zup"" is consistently ""yellow."" There is no context indicating that ""zup"" would mean anything other than the color yellow, no matter the surrounding words.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" translates to a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. Here is how it maps out:

- ""lug"" maps to ""blue"" and when ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue.""
- ""wif"" maps to ""red"" and when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red.""
- ""dax"" maps to ""green"" and when ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green.""
- When ""zup"" (which maps to ""yellow"") precedes ""dax"" and then followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""zup.""

Thus, ""bluf"" seems to mean ""repeat the color of the preceding word."" 

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.
From the given examples, it is possible to deduce a rule about what the nonce word ""walm"" represents. 

Let's observe the patterns:

1. When ""lug walm zup"" is input, the output is ""blue blue blue yellow blue"" where ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""zup"" to yellow, and before ""walm"" there are three ""blue"" indicating ""lug"" was repeated three times followed by ""walm"".

2. For ""wif walm dax"", the output is ""red red red green"", where ""wif"" likely corresponds to red, ""dax"" to green, and before ""walm"" there are three reds suggesting that ""wif"" was said three times followed by ""walm"".

3. ""zup walm lug"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow blue"" where ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, and again, before ""walm"" the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" repeats three times.

4. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"", where ""dax"" corresponds to green and it's the only word before ""walm"", repeated three times in the output.

5. Lastly, in the case of ""lug dax walm"", the output is ""blue green green green"". Here ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""walm"" follows ""dax"", with ""green"" repeated three times in the output.

From these observations, we can infer the following rule: 

**Rule**: ""walm"" instructs the output of the preceding color to be repeated three times. 

Thus:

walm -> Repeats the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all the provided examples.
To determine the rule for the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine the outputs in the positions corresponding to ""dax"" in each input line.

1. ""dax"" appears at positions 1, 4, 6, and 7 and corresponds to the colors green, blue, red, and green in the output.

2. ""dax"" is at position 5 and corresponds to green in the output.

3. ""dax"" appears at positions 1, 5, and 6 and corresponds to the colors green, blue, and green in the output.

4. ""dax"" is at position 3 and corresponds to green in the output.

5. ""dax"" is at position 4 and corresponds to green in the output.

Looking at the outputs for ""dax"" across all examples, we see that it frequently corresponds to the color green, except in some cases where it corresponds to blue or red. It seems that ""dax"" often appears at the beginning or end of the sequence or is surrounded by the same word when it corresponds to green. When not positioned like this, or surrounded by other distinct words, it then corresponds to other colors (blue or red). The pattern is not wholly determinable with the given examples. However, it does seem to bring a high propensity for ""green"" especially when appearing at the beginning or end.

Based on these observations, we cannot derive a conclusive rule for the word ""dax,"" but we can propose:

Rule: ""dax"" most likely corresponds to the color green, especially when positioned at the beginning or the end of a sequence or surrounded by repeated words. In the presence of certain other words (which are not repeated or at the beginning/end), the color may change to blue or red, but we need more data to determine the pattern for these exceptions.
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" appears in an input sequence, ""red"" appears in the output sequence at the corresponding position. Here is how it applies to each input:

- Input: dax wif lug -> Output: green red blue
  ""wif"" appears second and is translated to ""red"".

- Input: zup walm wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow red
  ""wif"" is last and is translated to ""red"".

- Input: wif -> Output: red
  ""wif"" is the only word and directly corresponds to ""red"".

- Input: dax bluf wif zup wif -> Output: green green red yellow red
  ""wif"" appears as the third and fifth words, and each time, ""red"" appears in the corresponding output positions.

- Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
  ""wif"" is the second word and is translated to ""red"".

So the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' means 'yellow', irrespective of the context it is used in.
Analyzing the provided examples, we can hypothesize a rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" as it relates to the output color words. Here is the breakdown:

1. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
2. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue
3. Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue yellow red red green
4. Input: lug bluf wif
   Output: blue blue red
5. Input: wif lug zup bluf
   Output: red blue yellow yellow

Looking at examples 1, 2, and 4, the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" is repeated as the color in the output. Example 3 can be seen as a pattern where colors are output in order, then ""bluf"" causes the most recent color to be repeated before reversing the sequence. This pattern also ensures ""dax"" translates to ""green"" as shown at the end of the sequence.

In example 5, ""bluf"" does not repeat ""zup"", but instead outputs ""yellow,"" which may be due to ""zup"" being paired with ""yellow"" in each instance it has appeared so far. However, this still fits the interpretation of ""bluf"" causing a repeat as ""zup"" was translated to ""yellow"" both before and after ""bluf"". So, in this case, ""bluf"" does not repeat the word ""zup"" but it repeats its translation ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be: 

Rule: The word ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word directly preceding it, meaning it duplicates the last translated color.

So, the underlying rule:

bluf -> repeats the color of the word before it.
Observing the examples provided:

- When ""wif walm"" is present, the output is ""red red red"".
- When ""walm wif"" is present, the output always includes one red at the end of a sequence of colors that match the word that comes before ""walm"".
- When ""walm"" is used between two words that are the same (""dax walm dax""), the output is the color associated with that word surrounding a sequence of blue.
- When ""walm"" is used between two different words (""lug walm dax""), the output is a sequence of the color associated with the first word followed by the color associated with the second word.

Based on these observations, it appears that ""walm"" requires looking at the words around it to determine the sequence of colors:

1. If ""walm"" is followed by a word, it repeats the color associated with that word an additional two times.
2. If ""walm"" is between two of the same words, it results in the color associated with those words with a sequence of blue in between.
3. If ""walm"" is between two different words, it creates a sequence of colors representing the first word followed by the second word.

Thus, the rule seems to involve generating a sequence of colors based on the words around ""walm"", with the specific pattern depending on the relationship between those adjacent words.

Rule: walm -> Signals a color repeating sequence based on adjacent words. If ""walm"" is followed by a word, it repeats the color associated with that word two additional times. If ""walm"" is between identical words, it is the color associated with that word followed by blue, and then the color again. If ""walm"" is between different words, it is a sequence starting with the color of the first word and ending with the color of the second word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax bluf wif lug
    ",Output: blue green blue red blue,blue green green red blue,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To induce the rule for the nonce word ""lug,"" let's analyze the input-output pairs given in the examples:

1. Input: wif lug | Output: red blue
2. Input: lug zup lug | Output: blue yellow blue
3. Input: zup lug | Output: yellow blue
4. Input: dax lug dax | Output: green blue green
5. Input: dax walm zup lug dax | Output: green green green yellow blue green
  
Examining these, we notice that regardless of the surrounding words (""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""dax,"" ""walm""), the presence of the word ""lug"" consistently results in the word ""blue"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" correlates to the color green regardless of its position within the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" No matter its position in the sequence of words, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the output. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" is as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided:

- The word following ""zup"" doesn't influence the color it translates to.
- Regardless of position in the sentence, ""zup"" always results in the same color.

Considering these points, ""zup"" consistently translates to the color yellow, regardless of its position or context within the given inputs.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To determine the rule that defines the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to carefully analyze the given examples and their corresponding outputs to identify any patterns. Let's review the examples provided:

1. Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
   Output: green green red yellow red

2. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue

3. Input: lug bluf zup
   Output: blue blue yellow

4. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

5. Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
   Output: blue green green yellow blue red

Looking at the inputs and corresponding outputs, it appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word that immediately precedes it. Here's how it breaks down:

1. ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green""
2. ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow""
3. ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue""
4. ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red""

This pattern holds for every instance of ""bluf"" in the input: it always duplicates the color of the word right before it.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" takes the same color value as the immediately preceding word.
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color word before it to repeat until the next color word is encountered. Let's look at each example:

1. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   Here, 'zup' is before 'walm', hence 'yellow' repeats until 'lug' (blue) is encountered again.

2. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   Here, 'wif' is before 'walm', hence 'red' repeats until 'lug' (blue) is encountered.

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Here, 'lug' is before 'walm' and no other color word is after 'walm', so 'blue' repeats.

4. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   Here, 'wif' is before 'walm', and 'dax' (green) follows, so 'red' repeats until 'dax'.

5. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   Here, 'dax' is before the first 'walm', hence 'green' repeats until 'zup' (yellow). Then 'lug' (blue) is before the second 'walm', hence 'blue' repeats.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the preceding color word until the next color word appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue"". There is no variation in the output when ""lug"" is present in the input, regardless of its position or the presence of other words. Hence, we can deduce the meaning of ""lug"" without additional context as follows:

lug -> meaning. Meaning: blue. Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, the output is ""blue"".
dax -> green
Given the examples provided, we can analyze the patterns and the corresponding outputs for the nonce word ""wif"". It appears that every time the word ""wif"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output.

Here are the breakdowns of the examples:

1. Input: ""zup wif walm lug"" -> Output: ""yellow red red red blue""
Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""walm"" corresponds to ""red red"", and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

2. Input: ""wif"" -> Output: ""red""
Here, the only word is ""wif"", and it corresponds directly to ""red"".

3. Input: ""zup wif dax walm lug"" -> Output: ""yellow red green green green blue""
Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""walm"" corresponds to ""green green"", and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

4. Input: ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> Output: ""red red green green green""
Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""walm"" corresponds to ""green green"".

5. Input: ""zup lug wif dax lug"" -> Output: ""yellow blue red green blue""
Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and the second ""lug"" repeats the corresponding ""blue"".

Based on these observations, we can deduce that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red"", and it does not seem to affect the surrounding words nor is its meaning affected by context.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" is used to indicate the color ""yellow"". Each time ""zup"" is used in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output.

Let's verify this rule with each example:

1. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red"".

2. Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
   Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" following the sequence of colors given for other words.

3. Input: dax zup lug wif lug
   Output: green yellow blue red blue
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" between ""green"" and ""blue"" as indicated.

4. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" following ""green"" from ""dax"" and preceding another sequence of ""green"" from ""dax"" and ""walm"".

5. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" at the end of a series of ""green"".

The rule is consistent throughout the examples. Therefore, zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that ""bluf"" translates to the color that directly precedes it. 

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which translates to blue, therefore ""bluf"" also translates to blue.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is after ""zup,"" which translates to yellow, so ""bluf"" means yellow here.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" again comes after ""lug"" (blue), so it's blue again.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), which makes ""bluf"" yellow.
- In the last example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" translating to red, hence ""bluf"" is red.

The rule appears to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color meaning of the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color meaning of the preceding word.
walm -> meaning. The word ""walm"" seems to indicate a repetition of the color previously mentioned three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a non-repeating word, it repeats the color corresponding to that word three times. For instance, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to red. Similarly, ""dax walm"" becomes ""green green green,"" with ""dax"" corresponding to green.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
