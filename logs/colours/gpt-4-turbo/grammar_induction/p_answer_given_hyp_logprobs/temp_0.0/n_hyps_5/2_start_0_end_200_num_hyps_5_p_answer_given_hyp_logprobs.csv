"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. 

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in each example.
Rule: dax -> green

Given the input and output patterns, the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position or the other words accompanying it.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position or the context it is used in.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in every example provided.
bluf -> repeating the color that immediately follows it. 

Rule: When the nonce word ""bluf"" appears in an input sequence, repeat the color that is represented by the word following ""bluf"". If ""bluf"" is the last word in the sequence or appears twice in succession, repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes this occurrence of ""bluf"".
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the change in output when each word appears:

1. ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green."" Since ""green"" is repeated three times and we know ""dax"" means ""green"" from previous examples, ""walm"" is likely causing the repetition, not changing the color.
   
2. ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red."" We've seen ""wif"" before, which means ""red."" The repetition in the output suggests that ""walm"" also causes repetition, not a color change.

3. ""wif dax lug walm"" results in ""red green blue blue blue."" We've already associated ""wif"" with ""red"" and ""dax"" with ""green."" ""Lug"" hasn't been analyzed yet, but based on the pattern, ""lug"" is likely ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated twice more.

4. ""zup wif walm lug"" results in ""yellow red red red blue."" Here ""zup"" seems to yield ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is confirmed as ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated twice.

5. ""lug walm zup walm"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow."" This is consistent with ""walm"" causing the repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it.

Taking all the examples into account:

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the previous color word to be repeated two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax
    ",Output: red green,red green,True,0
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that ""lug"" translates to the color blue.

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" is included in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Regardless of its position in a sequence, ""dax"" always translates to ""green"".
Based on the given examples, it seems that each unique word maps to a specific color:

- ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red.""
- ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green.""
- ""bluf"" results in repeating the immediately prior color.

Rule:
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- bluf -> repeat the previous color
Rule: zup -> yellow

Each example contains the word ""zup"" and consistently, the output includes the color ""yellow"" in the position that corresponds to where ""zup"" appears in the input. Therefore, we can deduce that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Here's how we can deduce the rule:

1. In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and then ""bluf"" also gives ""green."" The word ""wif"" gives ""red,"" and if ""bluf"" were after ""wif,"" it would also give ""red,"" as seen in the third example.

2. In the second example, there is no word before ""bluf,"" but ""bluf"" yields ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup."" However, this might be a coincidence as we need more context to confirm this.

3. The third example confirms that ""bluf"" mirrors the color of ""wif"" and ""dax,"" as it is red after ""wif,"" and green after ""dax.""

4. The fourth example solidifies the rule by showing that ""bluf"" after ""dax"" yields another ""green.""

5. Lastly, the fifth example shows that ""bluf"" after ""zup"" yields another ""yellow,"" which is consistent with the rule deduced.

So the rule can be defined as follows:

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word. If there is no preceding color word, the output may not be predictable based on these examples.
From the examples provided, we can infer the following:

Example 1 Output:
- zup = yellow
- wif = red
- lug = blue
- walm corresponds to three instances of the color red in a row

Example 2 Output:
- lug = blue
- wif = red
- zup = yellow
- walm corresponds to two sequences: one of three yellows following zup and one red following wif

Example 3 Output:
- wif = red
- dax = green
- walm corresponds to two additional instances of the color red

Example 4 Output:
- dax = green
- zup = yellow
- walm corresponds to double the previous color, once with green, and then with yellow after zup

Example 5 Output:
- dax = green
- lug = blue
- walm corresponds to triple the previous color with blue

Rule:
The word ""walm"" seems to repeat the previous color in the sequence a number of times. The number of repetitions appears to be related to the previous word:

- After ""wif"" (red), it repeats the color once (Example 3).
- After ""lug"" (blue), it repeats the color three times (Example 1 and 5).
- After ""zup"" (yellow), it repeats the color three times (Example 2) and once after ""wif"" (red).
- After ""dax"" (green), it repeats the color twice (Example 4).

In these examples, ""walm"" does not have a single static meaning but modifies the output based on the color word that comes before it, magnifying that color's count in the output. However, the exact rule for the number of repetitions based on each preceding word isn't entirely clear from the given examples. If we take the number of letters in the color word as a possible factor:

- ""wif"" has 3 letters and results in one additional repetition (red, Example 3).
- ""lug"" has 3 letters and results in three additional repetitions (blue, Example 1 and 5).
- ""zup"" has 3 letters and results in three additional repetitions (yellow, Example 2).
- ""dax"" has 3 letters and results in two additional repetitions (green, Example 4).

Given the small sample set and the unclear connection between the length of the preceding word and the number of repetitions by ""walm,"" we might hypothesize that ""walm"" simply means ""repeat the previous color based on an unclear pattern potentially related to the previous word."" Without further examples or clarification, we can only suggest it's a repeater without a definitive rule.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup
    ",Output: red yellow,red yellow,True,1
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, regardless of context within the examples provided.
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the instances where it appears and the corresponding output:

1. Input: dax walm wif -> Output: green green green red
2. Input: lug wif dax -> Output: blue red green
3. Input: dax walm zup lug -> Output: green green green yellow blue
4. Input: zup lug dax -> Output: yellow blue green
5. Input: dax bluf wif lug zup -> Output: green green red blue yellow

The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output sequence. It appears in various positions in the input list but maintains the same color association in the output.

Based on the above observations, we can deduce:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each occurrence of ""wif"" in the input results in ""red"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples given, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red being repeated twice. In every example provided, whenever the word ""bluf"" is present, the output includes ""red"" twice in succession:

- dax wif bluf -> green red red
- wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue
- dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
- dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
- zup wif bluf -> yellow red red

Additionally, the other words seem to correspond to unique colors:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- walm -> blue blue

Each word is mapped to a specific color or sequence of colors, except for ""bluf,"" which consistently translates to ""red red.""

Rule: bluf -> red red
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" correlates with a color that repeats three times. Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, the corresponding color in the output is repeated three times.

Analyzing the inputs and outputs:

- ""dax"" corresponds to green when it precedes ""walm"" but to red when it does not.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue.

In all cases, the presence of ""walm"" creates a triplet of the color that precedes it:

- Input 1: ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" corresponds to green red yellow yellow red red red. ""dax"" does not precede ""walm"" directly, so it is green. The ""wif"" that immediately precedes ""walm"" is red, so ""walm"" correlates to three reds.
- Input 2: ""wif walm dax"" has red prior to ""walm,"" so ""walm"" translates to three reds, followed by a green for ""dax.""
- Input 3: ""dax walm wif"" has green prior to ""walm,"" so ""walm"" corresponds to three greens followed by a red for ""wif.""
- Inputs 4 and 5 are the same: ""lug walm"" leads to blue blue blue since ""lug"" is before ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule here seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,2
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. 

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in every given example.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word translates to a specific color:

- ""wif"" corresponds to red
- ""walm"" corresponds to red
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue
- ""bluf"" corresponds to yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds to green

Now, let's look at the specific case for ""dax"":

- In every instance where ""dax"" appears, the output color is green, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it.
  
Given this consistent one-to-one relationship between the input ""dax"" and the output color green, we can deduce that ""dax"" corresponds to green.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, we can make an observation that each time the nonce word ""wif"" appears in the input, the color ""red"" appears in the corresponding output.

Here are the deductions made from the provided examples:

- Input: wif bluf dax -> Output: red red green
- Input: dax bluf wif lug -> Output: green green red blue
- Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow
- Input: wif -> Output: red
- Input: wif walm dax -> Output: red red red green

From these pieces of evidence, it's clear that irrespective of the position of ""wif"" in the sequence or the other words around it, the output is always ""red"" whenever it appears. No other word in the examples provided has a one-to-one correspondence with ""red"".

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

wif -> meaning: red
Upon examining the provided examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow."" This relationship is supported by the fact that every instance of ""zup"" in the inputs leads to the word ""yellow"" in the outputs. It also appears that each word in the input has a consistent color associated with it.

- In the first example, we have ""wif dax zup"" mapping to ""red green yellow."" Here, ""wif"" correlates to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""zup wif zup dax"" results in ""yellow red yellow green."" The pattern follows with ""zup"" producing ""yellow,"" ""wif"" resulting in ""red,"" and ""dax"" in ""green.""
- The third example also upholds this rule with ""zup dax lug zup"" becoming ""yellow green blue yellow."" Here again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and a new word ""lug"" correlates with ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" converts to ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue."" This is slightly more complex, as it introduces a new output, ""yellow,"" for the nonce word ""walm."" However, ""zup"" continues to correspond to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""zup lug"" translates to ""yellow blue,"" which is consistent with the previous individual translations of ""zup"" to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" seems to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided and their respective outputs, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the word ""red."" Additionally, it appears that other words in the input correspond to their own unique color output; for instance, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" 

Notably, when ""bluf"" is present multiple times in an input, it does not repeat in the output, akin to ""wif bluf lug zup,"" where ""bluf"" occurs once and is represented as ""red"" only once in the output.

Rule: bluf -> red. However, if ""bluf"" is repeated in the input, it is not repeated in the color translation in the output.
Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word. 

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" which indicates that ""walm"" takes the color of ""dax"" and repeats it three times.
- In the second example, ""dax walm wif"" translates to ""green green green red."" Here again, ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax"" (""green"") three times, and then the color associated with ""wif"" is ""red.""
- The third example ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" translates to ""green green green red blue green green green."" This means that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax"" (""green"") three times, follows the rule for ""wif"" (""red""), follows the rule for ""lug"" (""blue""), and then repeats the rule for ""walm"" after ""dax"" at the end (""green"" three times).
- The fourth example ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red."" In this case, ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif"" three times.
- The fifth example ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green."" Here ""walm"" again repeats the color of ""dax"" three times.

In all cases, ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that comes immediately before it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Every instance of the word ""lug"" in the given examples corresponds to the color ""blue.""
dax -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the same position in the output.

Rule: ""dax"" translates to the word ""green"".
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. Each nonce word in the inputs presented seems to translate to a specific color in the outputs, with ""wif"" consistently translating to ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each word in the input is translated to a specific color in the output, regardless of their position in the sequence:

- bluf -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- walm -> green green
- zup -> yellow

Reviewing each instance where ""zup"" is present in the input, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs:

1. ""zup dax bluf"" -> ""yellow green green""
2. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red""
3. ""zup wif bluf zup"" -> ""yellow red red yellow""
4. ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" -> ""blue red red green blue blue""
5. ""lug dax bluf"" -> ""blue green green""

Let's analyze:

- Whenever ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"", the corresponding color is yellow.
- Whenever ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"", the corresponding color is blue.
- Whenever ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" or ""dax"", the corresponding color is red or green, respectively, regardless of what comes before ""wif"" or ""dax"". This suggests that ""bluf"" itself does not directly translate to red or green but is dependent on the word that precedes it.

Observations:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the output color for ""bluf"" is yellow, the same as ""zup"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", the output color for ""bluf"" is blue, the same as ""lug"".
- ""Bluf"" does not appear in any context without either ""zup"" or ""lug"" before it.
- There is no instance where ""bluf"" appears without a preceding word, so we do not have an example of ""bluf"" in isolation to determine a standalone meaning.

Based on the given information, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately before it.

Therefore:

bluf -> The meaning is that ""bluf"" mimics the color of the preceding word.
Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to center around repetition. Each time walm is mentioned in the input, a sequence of red is repeated in the output. The number of ""red"" in the sequence increases by one with each subsequent instance of walm within the same input string. Here are the rules broken down:

1. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
2. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
3. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
4. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
5. The first appearance of ""walm"" corresponds to two reds (""red red"").
6. The second appearance of ""walm"" in the same input string adds one more red, leading to ""red red red"".
7. Each additional appearance of ""walm"" continues to add one red to the sequence.

So, the rule is:
walm -> An instance of ""red"" repeated, starting with two repetitions for the first occurrence and increasing by one with each subsequent occurrence within the same input string.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue in each example provided.
Rule: dax -> green.

Every instance of ""dax"" in the inputs corresponds to ""green"" in the outputs, irrespective of the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Regardless of its position in the input sequence (beginning, middle, or end), ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the output.
From the provided examples, it is possible to deduce the meaning or pattern associated with the nonce word ""zup."" By examining the correlation between the input and its corresponding output, we can try to identify what ""zup"" represents.

In every input, the word “zup” is consistently associated with the color “yellow” in the output. This suggests that the meaning of ""zup"" is the color yellow.

Here is the breakdown of the examples to support this rule:

1. Input: dax bluf wif zup  
   Output: green green red yellow  
   Observation: The presence of “zup” corresponds to “yellow” at the end.

2. Input: zup lug  
   Output: yellow blue  
   Observation: “zup” is followed by “lug,” and accordingly, the output starts with “yellow.”

3. Input: lug walm zup wif  
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red  
   Observation: “zup” appears before ""wif"" and corresponds to the only “yellow” in the sequence.

4. Input: zup lug zup dax  
   Output: yellow blue yellow green  
   Observation: Two instances of “zup” both correspond to “yellow” in the output.

5. Input: wif walm zup walm  
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow  
   Observation: “zup” appears after “wif” and “walm” and matches “yellow” in the output. Since “walm” follows “zup,” it might be associated with the repetition of the color ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, the rule is:

zup -> meaning: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the color ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. Here is how the rule applies in each of the given examples:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the color is red (Example 1: ""yellow red red"" and Example 2: ""blue red red"").
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the color is blue (Example 3: ""blue red red green blue blue"" and Example 4: ""blue blue green green"").
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the color is green (Example 3: ""blue red red green blue blue"", Example 4: ""blue blue green green"", and Example 5: ""green green"").

Therefore, the rule that can be deduced from these examples is:

**Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the word that precedes it.**
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to influence the output color sequence in a specific way. Here are the observations:

1. The presence of ""walm"" in the input correlates with a triplicate output of a certain color.
2. The color that is triplicated seems to be dependent on the word that immediately precedes ""walm"".
3. The color output that corresponds to the triplication caused by ""walm"" is consistent with the color output of the preceding word when ""walm"" is not present.
   - For instance, ""lug walm"" produces ""blue blue blue"". We can deduce that ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"".
   - ""dax walm wif"" results in ""green green green red"". We can deduce that ""dax"" correlates with ""green"", and ""wif"" correlates with ""red"".

Checking all the provided examples:
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"" (thus ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""walm"" causes triplication).
- ""dax walm wif"" leads to ""green green green red"" (thus ""dax"" is ""green"", ""walm"" causes triplication, and ""wif"" is ""red"").
- ""zup dax lug walm zup"" leads to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow"" (thus ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""dax"" is consistent with ""green"", ""lug"" is consistent with ""blue"", and ""walm"" causes the color for ""lug"" to be triplicated).
- ""wif walm dax zup"" leads to ""red red red green yellow"" (thus ""wif"" being consistent with ""red"" and ""walm"" causing triplication for ""wif"", with ""dax"" being consistent with ""green"" and ""zup"" being consistent with ""yellow"").
- ""dax walm zup lug dax"" leads to ""green green green yellow blue green"" (thus ""dax"" being consistent with ""green"" and ""walm"" causing triplication for ""dax"", with ""zup"" being consistent with ""yellow"", and ""lug"" being consistent with ""blue"").

Rule: walm -> triplicates the color output corresponding to the word immediately preceding it in the input sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples given, it seems that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Each occurrence of ""lug"" in the input results in ""blue"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule for ""lug"" can be defined as:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears before any other nonce word, the output is ""green"" followed by the color representation for the next word.
- When ""dax"" follows a nonce word such as ""zup,"" the following color is ""green.""

Thus, it is reasonable to deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green

This seems consistent with all the provided examples. ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to be associated with the color red when following the nonce word ""wif"" and yellow when standing alone or following the nonce word ""zup."" When following the nonce word ""lug"" or ""dax,"" its associated color is not explicitly shown, as ""bluf"" is not immediately followed by ""lug"" or ""dax"" in any of the examples.

Here is a breakdown based on the examples provided:

- The sequence ""lug walm wif bluf"" resulted in ""blue blue blue red red,"" which indicates that ""walm"" correlates with blue, and ""wif bluf"" correlates with red red. It doesn’t give us a rule for ""bluf"" following ""lug"" since ""wif"" is between ""lug"" and ""bluf.""
- The sequence ""wif bluf zup"" resulted in ""red red yellow,"" suggesting that the standalone ""bluf"" might correlate with yellow, but ""wif bluf"" correlates with red red.
- The sequence ""lug dax bluf wif dax"" resulted in ""blue green green red green,"" showing that ""dax"" correlates with green and reinforcing that ""wif bluf"" correlates with red. The color associated with ""bluf"" in the context of ""lug dax"" is unclear because it's followed by ""wif,"" which has a strong association with red.
- The sequence ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" resulting in ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue"" suggests that when ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it correlates with yellow.
- Finally, ""wif bluf"" consistently resulting in ""red red"" reinforces the specific sequence of ""wif bluf"" correlating with red.

Given the variations and the inconsistent placement of ""bluf,"" it's hard to assign a definitive meaning to ""bluf."" However, considering the pattern, it's reasonable to suggest the following tentative rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" correlates with the color red when immediately preceded by ""wif"" and correlates with the color yellow when standing alone or immediately preceded by ""zup."" The meaning of ""bluf"" when following other nonce words is not sufficiently demonstrated by the examples provided.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to understand the correlation between the input and the output in each example. Let's compare the position of ""walm"" in the inputs to the corresponding colors in the output:

1. dax walm zup lug -> green green yellow blue
2. dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red red blue yellow yellow
3. dax walm wif walm -> green green red red
4. lug walm dax wif lug wif -> blue blue green red blue red
5. dax walm zup lug dax -> green green yellow blue green
   
Breaking down the patterns:

- ""dax"" consistently translates to the color green.
- ""zup"" consistently translates to the color yellow.
- ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue.
- ""wif"" consistently translates to the color red.

By examining the sequences where ""walm"" appears and corresponding color outputs, we can infer the following:

- Every instance of ""walm"" is followed by green in the output, except when it follows an already mentioned color word (like in example number 2, where there's red before walm, resulting in ""yellow yellow""), indicating that ""walm"" may mean repetition or ""again.""

Given the consistent presence of green after ""walm"" (indicating repetition) and the observed variance when another color word precedes it, we can draw the following conclusion:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that appears immediately before it.

Thus, the rule can be stated as:
Walm -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,6
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Rule: lug translates to ""blue"". In every example where ""lug"" is present, the output always includes the color ""blue"".
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" as seen consistently throughout the examples provided. Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the output includes the color ""green"" in the corresponding position.
Based on the examples provided, each item in the input list appears to correspond to a specific color in the output list. The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the output. Here's the mapping from the given inputs and outputs:

- dax -> green
- bluf -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- walm -> blue (as seen in the second and fourth examples where ""walm"" yields ""blue"")

The input-to-output mapping appears to be as follows:

- The first input maps to the first color in the output.
- The second input maps to the second color in the output, and so on.
- There are no explicit conditionals or exceptions mentioned for the provided mappings.

Therefore, using these observations, the rule for ""wif"" can be defined as:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" consistently every time it appears in an input. 

For each example:
- ""wif zup dax"" corresponds to ""red yellow green"", with ""zup"" translating to ""yellow"".
- ""zup walm lug"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow blue"", with ""zup"" translating to the first ""yellow"".
- ""zup wif"" corresponds to ""yellow red"", with ""zup"" translating to ""yellow"".
- ""zup lug"" corresponds to ""yellow blue"", with ""zup"" translating to ""yellow"".
- ""zup"" on its own corresponds to ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" mirrors the color of the word that comes immediately before it. If there is no word before ""bluf"", it mirrors the color of the word that comes immediately after it.
- In the first example, ""dax"" means green, and ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", so ""bluf"" also means green.
- In the second example, ""wif"" means red, and ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", making ""bluf"" also mean red.
- In the third example, ""zup"" means yellow, and ""bluf"" follows it, so ""bluf"" likewise means yellow; this rule is also applied afterward with ""wif"" and ""bluf"" both meaning red.
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" means blue, followed by ""bluf"", which then also means blue; ""wif"" subsequently means red.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" means green, which comes before ""bluf"", thus ""bluf"" means green.

bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is the color represented by the word immediately preceding it; if it is at the beginning, it takes the color of the word immediately following it.
Analyzing the inputs and their corresponding outputs, here's the pattern I can deduce:

- Regardless of the position in the sequence, ""walm"" always results in three reds following the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"".
- The non-""walm"" words correspond to a single color: ""wif"" is red, ""lug"" is blue, ""zup"" is yellow, ""dax"" is green, and ""bluf"" is also blue.

For example:
- ""wif walm"" generates ""red red red red"".
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green green"".

Given these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

walm -> Triples the color of the preceding word.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows another word, output three instances of that word's corresponding color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm
    ",Output: blue blue blue,blue blue blue,True,7
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the given examples. Every time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" appears to correspond to the color ""green."" Each time the word ""dax"" is presented in the input, the output includes the color green. When other words like ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" and ""walm"" are used, they correspond to other colors or multiple occurrences of the same color. For instance, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" seems to correspond to three occurrences of the color green, indicating that it might amplify or multiply the number of times the output color is mentioned.

Here's the breakdown:
- When ""wif"" is combined with ""dax,"" the output is ""red green,"" thus ""wif"" is likely ""red,"" as ""dax"" is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" appears alone or with other words (""bluf"" or ""walm""), the output is simply ""green"" or multiple ""green"" without introducing any new colors.
- ""lug"" and ""zup"" are not ""dax,"" and they output ""blue"" and ""yellow,"" respectively. In the sequence ""lug zup dax wif zup,"" the corresponding output follows the same order of colors as these words are mentioned.

Rule: dax -> ""green""
Based on the provided examples, it is evident that each nonce word is consistently translated to a specific color in the output. For example:

- Every instance of ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.
- Every instance of ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
- Every instance of ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output.
- Every instance of ""dax"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.

Following this pattern of direct correspondence, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" in every example provided. 

Hence the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red. The meaning of ""wif"" is consistently ""red"".
Based on the examples provided, we can infer that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Here is the rule based on each input-output example:

1. lug zup wif zup -> blue yellow red yellow
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" appears twice, each time corresponding to ""yellow.""

2. wif lug zup walm wif lug -> red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" likely corresponds to a repetition of the previous color, in this case ""yellow.""

3. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" once again corresponds to a repetition of the previous color, ""red.""

4. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" could be a modifier that causes the next color to repeat, which would be ""green.""

5. dax walm zup lug -> green green green yellow blue
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" seems to correspond to a repetition of ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Hence, the rule appears to be:
Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> red. 

Rule: The word ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the given examples.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine each instance where it occurs and its corresponding output:

1. lug walm zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow red
2. lug wif dax zup walm -> blue red green yellow yellow yellow
3. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue
4. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
5. dax walm wif dax -> green green green red green

Let's analyze the patterns:

- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output color for ""walm"" is ""blue.""
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output color for ""walm"" is ""yellow.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output color for ""walm"" is ""green.""
- We don't have examples of ""walm"" following ""wif"" directly, so we can't determine a pattern for that.

By examining the sequences, it seems that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it. ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" Therefore, ""walm"" seems to mirror its preceding color indicator. 

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the word preceding it. If preceded by ""lug,"" it's blue; if preceded by ""zup,"" it's yellow; and if preceded by ""dax,"" it's green. If ""walm"" does not immediately follow one of these indicators, we may not have enough information to determine its meaning within the given data.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue.""
From the examples given, dax consistently corresponds to the color ""green"". The output does not change regardless of its position in the sequence:

- dax wif -> green red 
- dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
- dax -> green
- dax -> green
- lug dax lug -> blue green blue

Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"". Here is a summary of the inputs and their outputs:

- Input: dax bluf lug wif -> Output: green green blue red
- Input: zup wif zup -> Output: yellow red yellow
- Input: wif zup -> Output: red yellow
- Input: wif dax -> Output: red green
- Input: wif -> Output: red

The ""wif"" term is always resulting in ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the context of other words around it. Therefore, the rule can be formulated as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it seems the nonce word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" output. Here's the reasoning:

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output, regardless of the position of ""bluf"" in the sentence. 

- Other words in the input correlate with other colors in the output. For example, ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" with ""green"" as well.

So, it appears that each word in the input directly maps to a color in the output. Since ""dax"" also maps to ""green,"" it is possible that ""bluf"" and ""dax"" are synonyms within this constructed language or context.

Rule: bluf -> green
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" is repeated as many times as the preceding word following this pattern:

- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"", which shows that ""lug"" is represented by ""blue"", and ""walm"" results in the word ""blue"" being repeated three times.
- ""zup wif walm lug"" results in ""yellow red red red blue"". Here ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""wif"" is ""red"", and since ""walm"" follows ""wif"", ""red"" is repeated three times, followed by ""lug"" which is ""blue"" once.
- ""wif lug dax walm"" translates to ""red blue green green green"". ""wif"" is ""red"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""dax"" is ""green"", and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" (which follows ""dax"") three times.
- ""lug walm zup walm"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow"". ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow"". Both are followed by ""walm"", meaning both are repeated three times respectively.
- ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green"". ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and is followed by ""walm"", so ""yellow"" is repeated three times; ""lug"" is ""blue""; ""zup"" is repeated as ""yellow"", ""wif"" as ""red"", and ""dax"" as ""green"".

The pattern indicates that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each given example.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following patterns for the words `dax`, `zup`, `walm`, `wif`, and `lug`:

- Whenever the word `dax` appears, the output is `green`.
- When `zup` appears, the output is `yellow`.
- The word `walm` results in an output of `green` when it follows `dax` but changes to `blue` otherwise. 
- The word `wif` consistently results in the output `red`.
- The word `lug` consistently results in the output `blue`.

From these observations, the rule for the nonce word `dax` can be deduced as:

Rule: `dax` -> `green`. The word `dax` always corresponds to the color `green` regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by looking at the pattern of outputs relative to the position of ""wif"" in the input sequence.

In every example where ""wif"" appears, the output includes the color ""red."" Additionally, ""wif"" seems to correspond to only one color, which is ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Here are the examples mapped out more explicitly:

1. lug walm zup wif => blue blue blue yellow red (red corresponds to ""wif"")
2. dax wif => green red (red corresponds to ""wif"")
3. lug wif lug => blue red blue (red corresponds to ""wif"")
4. wif walm => red red red (the first red corresponds to ""wif"")
5. wif => red (red corresponds to ""wif"")

Based on this consistent pattern, we can conclude the rule for the word ""wif"":

Rule: wif translates to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the examples and their respective outputs. We'll compare the position of ""bluf"" to the color it corresponds to in the output.

1. wif bluf dax -> red red green
2. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
3. dax bluf wif lug -> green green red blue
4. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red
5. lug dax bluf zup lug wif -> blue green green yellow blue red

We can see that ""bluf"" corresponds to the following colors:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" is in the second position and the second color is red.
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" is in the third position and the third color is yellow.
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" is in the second position and the second color is green.
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is in the fourth position and the fourth color is yellow.
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is in the third position and the third color is green.

From the examples provided, it's not immediately clear what ""bluf"" corresponds to because the color it maps to changes with each example. However, we might notice that ""bluf"" never corresponds to blue, which is one potential hypothesis.

Let's refine our analysis by checking the position of the other words in different examples:

- The word ""wif"" seems to consistently map to red when it appears.
- The word ""dax"" seems to consistently map to green when it appears first or second, but not last.
- The word ""lug"" maps to blue when it appears first and red when last.

Considering the consistent mappings, it's likely that ""bluf"" does not have a consistent one-to-one mapping with a color that we can determine with this information alone. Instead, it seems that ""bluf"" might be functioning as a modifier to the rules that determine the corresponding colors for other words. 

For instance, in example 4 where there are two instances of ""wif"", when ""bluf"" is present before the second ""wif"", the color corresponding to that ""wif"" changes from red to yellow (which it shouldn't if ""wif"" always maps to red). However, this theory doesn't hold since ""bluf"" itself also directly corresponds to yellow in examples 2 and 4.

Unfortunately, with the given examples, there's insufficient information to conclusively establish a consistent rule for what ""bluf"" means, since the resulting color changes. To provide an accurate answer, we would need more information or additional examples that help us identify a pattern or rule that ""bluf"" follows.

Rule: Insufficient information is available to deduce a consistent meaning or rule for the nonce word ""bluf"". More examples are needed to determine the underlying pattern.
Based on the input-output pairings provided, we can make some observations:

1. Whenever ""walm"" is present in the input, the output contains a repeated color that corresponds to the color of the word preceding ""walm"".
   - Example: ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" -> ""blue green yellow green green green red""
     Here ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which corresponds to ""green"", and the output has a sequence of ""green"" repeated.

2. The color that repeats in the output matches the color of the word immediately before ""walm"" for all instances of ""walm"".
   - Example: ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
     Here ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"", and the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.

3. The number of repetitions of the color in the output seems to be dependent on the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.
   - Example: In ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"", ""walm"" is the fifth word (excluding the first word ""lug"" from the count, since it appears untransformed) and the color ""green"" is repeated three times.

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" takes the color of the word immediately before it and repeats it by the number of times equal to its position in the sequence (not counting the first instance of ""lug"", ""dax"", ""zup"", or ""wif"" if it is the first word in the series). This repetition occurs just before the color corresponding to the word that comes after ""walm"". If there is no word after ""walm"", the repetition is the final part of the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word several times as per its ordinal position (not counting the color for the first word if it is at the beginning), and then follow it with the color corresponding to the word that comes after ""walm"" if there is one.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: dax -> green

In every example, the occurrence of the word 'dax' consistently translates to the color 'green'.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the provided examples.
Based on the given examples, it can be inferred that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates into the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the surrounding context. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to examine the consistent correlation between the input containing ""bluf"" and the corresponding output color.

Here are the examples with ""bluf"":

1. dax wif bluf -> green red red
2. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
3. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
4. wif bluf lug dax wif -> red red blue green red
5. zup bluf lug dax lug -> yellow yellow blue green blue

Observations:

- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" (examples 1 and 3), the output color is red.
- When ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" (examples 4 and 5), the output color preceding ""lug"" is also red.
- When ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup"" (example 2), the output color is green.
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by a non-""lug"" word (example 2), the output color is green.

From these observations, ""bluf"" seems to be acting as a rule-dependent word that does not have a consistent color output but rather depends on the context of the words around it. This suggests that ""bluf"" does not map directly to one specific color but might be indicative of a transformation or interaction rule affecting the colors of surrounding words. However, with the given examples, there is not enough consistent data to conclusively define a single rule for ""bluf.""

Based on the limited information and the given examples, the rule seems to be:
- ""bluf"" results in the color red when it either precedes or follows ""lug"" or is preceded by ""wif"".
- ""bluf"" results in the color green when it is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by a non-""lug"" word.

However, this interpretation might change with additional examples that could provide further context or exceptions to the observed patterns. At present, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: ""bluf"" influences the output color based on the context of the surrounding words, particularly resulting in red when associated with ""lug"" or ""wif,"" and green when preceded by ""dax"" and not directly followed by ""lug.""
Analyzing the provided examples, one can notice a pattern in the output that corresponds to the occurrence of the word ""walm"" in the input:

- wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
- dax walm zup -> green green green yellow
- lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> blue blue red blue red red red blue
- wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif -> red red green green red red red blue red
- zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red

In each instance, the word ""walm"" seems to cause a repeated color in the sequence which is the same color as the word that comes immediately before ""walm"":

- dax (green) walm -> green green green
- wif (red) walm -> red red red
- wif (red) walm lug -> red red red blue

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it repeats the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it in the input sequence.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the word immediately before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Analyzing the given examples and their corresponding outputs, we can infer the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" in the context provided. Here's a breakdown of each input and output to understand the pattern:

1. Input: ""zup lug walm wif dax"" | Output: ""yellow blue blue blue red green""
2. Input: ""lug dax"" | Output: ""blue green""
3. Input: ""zup lug"" | Output: ""yellow blue""
4. Input: ""lug dax walm wif"" | Output: ""blue green green green red""
5. Input: ""dax lug dax lug walm"" | Output: ""green blue green blue blue blue""

From the given data, every time the word ""lug"" appears, the word ""blue"" follows it in the output, regardless of its position or the number of times it is repeated. No other input words singlehandedly result in the output ""blue."" Therefore, we can deduce that the nonce word ""lug"" translates directly to the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> meaning. Meaning: ""blue""
Based on the examples given, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" every time it is used.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" seems to produce the output ""red"" each time it appears. To further delineate this pattern, let's look at each example:

- When ""wif"" appears alone with another word like ""bluf"" or ""lug,"" it is followed by ""red,"" and then the color associated with the other word.
- When ""wif"" appears multiple times in a sequence, such as in the fourth example, each occurrence of ""wif"" is followed by ""red.""
- Additionally, other words like ""zup"" and ""dax"" have consistent outputs associated with them (""yellow"" for ""zup"" and ""green"" for ""dax"") regardless of the presence of ""wif.""
- In scenarios where ""wif"" is in a sequence with other words, such as ""walm"" or ""lug,"" the words following ""wif"" have consistent color outputs ('red' for ""walm"" and 'blue' for ""lug"") as well.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
Rule: zup -> yellow

The consistent appearance of the word ""zup"" correlates with the appearance of the word ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the position or the other words in the input sequence. Hence, ""zup"" is deduced to mean ""yellow"".
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" leads to a repetition of the color that had just been mentioned. Specifically, when the word ""bluf"" follows another word associated with a color, the output is two instances of that color. Here are the observed patterns:

- ""lug bluf"" leads to ""blue blue""
- ""dax bluf"" leads to ""green green""
- ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow""
- ""wif dax bluf"" leads to ""red green green"" (note that ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green)
- ""zup dax bluf"" leads to ""yellow green green"" (again ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green)

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color mentioned before it.
Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" appears to be associated with the duplication of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. Let's analyze the inputs and outputs to identify the pattern:

1. Input: ""zup walm"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow yellow"" 
   - ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"", and the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.
   
2. Input: ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" -> Output: ""blue blue red blue red red red blue"" 
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"", and the color ""red"" is repeated twice before the pattern resumes with ""lug"" which is ""blue"".
   
3. Input: ""zup walm lug wif"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow yellow blue red"" 
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the result is ""yellow"" repeated, then the pattern continues with ""lug"" being ""blue"" and ""wif"" being ""red"".
   
4. Input: ""lug walm"" -> Output: ""blue blue blue"" 
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times.
   
5. Input: ""dax walm wif dax"" -> Output: ""green green green red green""
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""green"" is repeated, followed by the colors corresponding to ""wif"" (red) and then ""dax"" (green) once again.

Each time, ""walm"" appears to produce three repetitions of the color associated with the word that comes before it.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.

Given this pattern, the word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"". Every time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output.

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the given examples.
Given the provided examples, the word 'zup' seems to correspond to the color 'yellow' in the output every time it is mentioned. Each occurrence of 'zup' in the input results in 'yellow' in the output, regardless of the position of 'zup' in the input sequence or the surrounding words. Other words like 'dax', 'lug', and 'bluf' seem to correspond reliably to 'green', 'blue', and 'green' respectively. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of 'zup' based solely on these examples is as follows:

Rule: zup -> 'yellow'
bluf -> red

Rule: The color represented by ""bluf"" seems to be consistently matched with the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. If ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the color is yellow, if it follows ""wif,"" the color is red, following ""lug"" results in blue, and following ""dax"" turns it green. Given the last example, even though ""bluf"" is after ""wif,"" both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" are assigned red, reinforcing that ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the preceding word.
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color that came before it three times. In each case, the word before ""walm"" corresponds to a single color, and the output after ""walm"" is that color repeated three times. 

Here’s the breakdown based on the given examples:

1. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" and after ""walm"" we see ""red"" three times.

2. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue,"" and after ""walm"" we see ""blue"" three times.

3. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
This is the same as the previous example and the pattern holds.

4. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" -> ""green blue blue blue yellow red""
In this example, the pattern holds for ""lug walm"" giving us ""blue blue blue,"" and then it continues as normal with ""zup wif"" adding ""yellow red"" to the sequence.

5. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""walm"" we see ""green"" repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> a function that repeats the color word directly preceding it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif walm
    ",Output: blue red red red,blue red red red,True,13
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the outputs provided.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""dax,"" let's examine the common patterns associated with it in each given example.

1. ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green yellow red green green""
2. ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" -> ""green red green yellow yellow""
3. ""zup dax lug zup"" -> ""yellow green blue yellow""
4. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
5. ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" -> ""green green red yellow green""

Looking at the outputs, we can see that every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output. 

Based on these examples, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence or the context of other words around it.

So, the rule is:

dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in all given examples.
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be:

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" 

Thus, the meaning is:
zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word bluf corresponds with the color that the preceding word represents. Here's how we can infer that from each example:

- In the first example, the word dax corresponds with the color green and is followed by bluf, which then also corresponds with the color green.
- In the second example, the word wif corresponds with the color red and is followed by bluf, which also corresponds with the color red.
- In the third example, the word zup corresponds with the color yellow, followed by bluf, which corresponds with the color yellow as well.
- In the fourth example, zup corresponds with the color yellow, lug corresponds with blue, and bluf corresponds with the color that directly precedes it (zup -> yellow, lug -> blue).
- In the fifth example, similar to the previous, dax corresponds with green, wif corresponds with red, zup corresponds with yellow, lug corresponds with blue, and bluf takes on the color of the word right before it.

Rule:
bluf -> repeats the color of the word that comes immediately before bluf.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the pattern of colors corresponding to the given words in each input and their respective outputs.

- The first input-output pair repeats ""red"" twice for the word ""wif"" and three times ""yellow"" for ""walm.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" is translated to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" When ""walm"" appears, it outputs ""blue"" twice, following ""lug.""
- The third example has just ""lug"" and ""walm,"" which results in ""blue"" three times.
- In the fourth input-output pair, we have ""zup,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug"" precede ""walm,"" followed by ""wif."" The colors translate to ""yellow,"" ""green,"" ""blue,"" and ""red,"" respectively.
- The last example includes ""dax"" and ""zup"" with ""dax"" again before ""walm."" The pattern is ""green,"" ""yellow,"" and ""green"" again, followed by three ""green"" for ""walm.""

Looking at these examples, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it: two repetitions if preceded by ""lug"" and three if preceded by any other word.

Rule: walm -> ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word, two repetitions if preceded by ""lug,"" otherwise three repetitions.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,14
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Given the examples, we can induce the meaning of ""lug"" by comparing the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Let's break it down:

- Input: wif dax wif lug wif / Output: red green red blue red
- Input: wif bluf lug / Output: red red blue
- Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup / Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
- Input: lug / Output: blue
- Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif / Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red

Looking at the inputs and outputs, we can see that every instance of ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue."" Regardless of the position ""lug"" is in or the other words around it, the output is consistently blue. Therefore, we can deduce that ""lug"" translates to the color blue.

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. 

dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, it translates to ""red"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, we can infer the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""zup"" by looking at the context in which it appears and the corresponding outputs. 

1. In the first example, ""dax zup"" results in ""green yellow."" This does not provide much context alone.

2. In the second example, ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" corresponds to ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue."" If we line up the inputs and outputs:
   - wif -> red
   - walm -> red, blue (second instance of walm)
   - dax -> green
   - zup -> yellow
   - lug -> blue
   
   We can see that other words like wif, walm, dax, and lug correspond to single colors or a change in color on the second occurrence for walm, but zup consistently corresponds to the color yellow no matter its position or neighboring words.

3. In the third example, ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow."" It is consistent with zup translating to yellow.

4. In the fourth example, ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" showing a repetition of yellow for each occurrence of zup, and adding additional (in this case, two more) yellows for walm.

5. In the fifth example, ""wif zup"" generates ""red yellow."" We already inferred wif to be red, and zup is consistent with being yellow again.

The consistent output for ""zup"" across diverse contexts is ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color that is represented by the word immediately preceding ""bluf"". Here's the rule derived from the given examples:

- ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green"", indicating that ""bluf"" takes on the color of ""dax"", which is green.
- ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue"", indicating that ""bluf"" takes on the color of ""lug"", which is blue.
- ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"", indicating that ""bluf"" takes on the color of ""zup"", which is yellow.
- ""lug wif bluf"" results in ""blue red red"", which suggests ""bluf"" takes the color of the immediately preceding word ""wif"", which is red.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" means the same color as the word that comes before it.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" correlates with a sequence of the same color word being repeated three times. To determine the specific color that ""walm"" represents, let's analyze the examples:

1. ""dax walm wif walm zup"" results in ""green green green red red red yellow"" – Here, we can see that after ""dax,"" which results in ""green"" once, ""walm"" follows and corresponds to three ""green"" outputs. Similar pattern is seen with ""wif walm zup"" resulting in ""red red red yellow.""

2. ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"" – ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output sequence is three ""red."" It signals that ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" being repeated three times after ""wif.""

3. ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" results in ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue"" – ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" again corresponds to a triple sequence of the last color mentioned before it.

4. ""wif walm dax zup"" results in ""red red red green yellow"" – ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" same as the second example.

5. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" – ""lug"" comes before ""walm,"" and the output is three ""blue,"" once again showing that ""walm"" corresponds to a triple sequence of the last color mentioned.

From these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" corresponds to three repetitions of the color word immediately preceding it.

Hence, the meaning of ""walm"" is:

walm -> meaning is to repeat the previous color word three times in the output sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,15
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be:

lug -> blue

Every instance where the word ""lug"" is used in the input, the word ""blue"" is produced in the output. This suggests that ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
Rule: dax -> green

Every instance of the word ""dax"" in the inputs corresponds to ""green"" in the outputs. Regardless of the position in the sequence or the surrounding words, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we need to look at each instance and its associated color output.

1. ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" -> yellow yellow red green red yellow
2. ""wif dax"" -> red green
3. ""dax zup lug wif lug"" -> green yellow blue red blue
4. ""zup dax lug wif dax"" -> yellow green blue red green
5. ""wif dax lug walm"" -> red green blue blue blue

Looking at the above examples:

- In examples 1, 3, and 4, ""wif"" precedes different words (""dax"", ""lug"", ""dax"") and is followed by the colors red and green respectively, suggesting that ""wif"" directly translates to red.
- Example 2 reinforces this as ""wif dax"" corresponds to red green.
- Example 5 also supports this as ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, with the word following it (""dax"") being green again.

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the corresponding outputs for each input.

1. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
2. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
3. wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> red blue blue yellow yellow green
4. dax bluf wif lug -> green green red blue
5. dax bluf -> green green

By examining the outputs, we can infer the following:

- Whenever ""bluf"" is present, the color that immediately follows is the same as the one before ""bluf"".
- This doesn't apply when ""bluf"" is the last word. However, in the case where ""bluf"" is both preceded and followed by ""dax"" (Example 5), the output for both instances of ""dax"" and ""bluf"" is green.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word before it, implying it may act as a sort of echo or duplicator for the preceding word's associated color.

Rule: bluf -> The word ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with the word immediately before it. If ""bluf"" is the last word, it retains the color associated with the word immediately before it without any duplicating effect since there's no word after ""bluf"" to influence.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the patterns and relationships in the input-to-output transformation. Let's look at the outputs when ""walm"" is present and how they relate to the other words (""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""wif,"" and ""bluf"") and their corresponding color outputs:

1. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""
2. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
3. ""zup dax walm"" -> ""yellow green green green""
4. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" -> ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue""
5. ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red blue blue""

Examining patterns:

- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue,"" which we can see in all examples.
- ""walm"" seems to repeat the previous color output. For instance:
  - In the first example, the sequence ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"".
  - In the second example, ""zup walm"" alone also gives ""yellow yellow yellow.""
  - In the third example, ""dax walm"" follows a ""zup,"" resulting in ""green green green,"" where ""dax"" is assumed to be ""green.""
  - In the fourth example, after ""zup walm"" we see ""yellow yellow yellow"" once again.
  - In the fifth example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue.""

So, it seems like ""walm"" turns the previous color into its output for the next two positions (or simply duplicates the previous color thrice, including its own position).

Rule: walm -> duplicates the previous color output in its own and the next two positions.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif walm
    ",Output: red red red,red red red,True,16
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output includes the color ""blue"".
Based on the examples provided, the following correspondences can be established:

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green

Thus, from the examples provided, we can deduce:

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" is outputted in the corresponding position in the output sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's examine the input and output pairs:

1. lug wif lug dax bluf -> blue red blue green green
2. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red
3. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue
4. lug walm zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow red
5. lug wif bluf -> blue red red

By noting the placement of ""wif"" and the corresponding outputs, it appears that the word that immediately follows ""wif"" is translated into the color ""red,"" since ""wif"" precedes ""lug"" in the first and third examples, and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" yet the output is ""red blue."" In the second and fourth examples, ""wif"" is the last word and is followed by ""red"" in the output.

So, from this evidence, the rule seems to be:
wif -> replace the following word with ""red""

Rule: The word immediately following ""wif"" is translated into the color ""red"" regardless of what that word typically translates to. If ""wif"" is the last word, it translates to ""red"" itself.
From the given examples, we can attempt to identify the rule by correlating each input word with its corresponding output color. Each input word is likely to represent a color in the output. 

Analyzing each input and its output:

Example 1:
Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
The word ""zup"" here corresponds to the first ""yellow"" in the output.

Example 2:
Input: lug zup dax lug dax
Output: blue yellow green blue green
The word ""zup"" here corresponds to ""yellow"" again.

Example 3:
Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
Output: green green red yellow blue
The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" once more.

Example 4:
Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red
The word ""zup"" corresponds to both occurrences of ""yellow"" in the output.

Example 5:
Input: lug zup
Output: blue yellow
The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" again.

Based on the information provided by these examples, every single instance of ""zup"" in the input is translated to ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at each instance where it appears and the corresponding output:

1. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""zup"" to yellow. Since ""bluf"" also maps to yellow, we cannot make a definitive rule yet.

2. lug bluf dax lug -> blue blue green blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""dax"" to green. Since ""bluf"" maps to blue, it might mean the same as the word before it.

3. zup bluf wif lug dax -> yellow yellow red blue green
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" to red, ""lug"" to blue, and ""dax"" to green. Again, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and also corresponds to yellow.

4. dax bluf zup bluf dax -> green green yellow yellow green
- ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""zup"" to yellow. Here, ""bluf"" follows both ""dax"" and ""zup"" and corresponds to the color of the word it immediately follows.

5. lug bluf zup lug -> blue blue yellow blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""zup"" to yellow. Again, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and maps to blue.

Based on these observations, it appears that the rule for ""bluf"" is that it takes on the color of the word that comes immediately before it. If ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is green; if it follows ""zup,"" the output is yellow; if it follows ""lug,"" the output is blue, and so on. There are no examples with ""wif"" followed by ""bluf,"" so we cannot be sure of that mapping, but the existing rule still seems to hold true.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word.
Rule: walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm,"" three times.

From the examples provided:

1. ""zup lug walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" which corresponds to blue is followed by ""walm,"" and blue is repeated three times.
   
2. ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue."" There is no word before ""lug,"" so it seems ""lug"" itself, corresponding to blue, is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in blue being repeated three times.
   
3. ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red."" First, ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow is followed by ""walm,"" giving us three yellows. Later, ""walm"" is not present, so this segment of the examples doesn't inform the rule for ""walm.""

4. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" Here, ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in three yellows in a row.

5. ""wif walm lug bluf"" translates to ""red red red blue blue."" ""Wif"" which corresponds to red is followed by ""walm,"" giving us three reds in a row.

Based on these examples, when the word ""walm"" appears, it directs us to repeat the color corresponding to the immediate preceding word three times.

Therefore: walm -> repeat the preceding word's color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in these examples.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs. Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" is mentioned in the output at the same position.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" we need to look for patterns in the input and output pairings provided.

- In the first example, ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue."" We can't deduce much from this example alone, but we can note that ""lug"" seems to correspond with ""blue.""

- In the second example, ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red."" We can infer that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and potentially confirm that ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red"" given that ""wif"" precedes it and the output is ""red red"".

- The third example, ""lug wif,"" translates to ""blue red,"" supporting the idea that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and suggesting that ""wif"" might correspond to ""red.""

- The fourth example, ""zup bluf wif walm,"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red."" Given that ""bluf"" has corresponded to ""red"" previously and ""wif"" follows it, we can suggest that ""wif"" does not change the previous color but potentially means another ""red."" ""zup"" doesn't give us anything consistent with ""wif.""

- The last example, ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf,"" translates to ""red green yellow red green green,"" which suggests that ""wif"" could mean ""red,"" as it precedes ""dax"" (which means ""green"") and ""zup"" (which means ""yellow""). The word ""dax"" and ""bluf"" following ""wif"" seem to be mapping to their respective colors (""green"" for ""dax"" and ""red"" for ""bluf""), reinforcing the idea that ""wif"" itself directly represents ""red.""

Based on these observations, the word ""wif"" most directly relates to the word ""red,"" although there may be additional context-specific rules affecting its translation that aren't entirely clear from the given examples. However, if we consider only the usage of ""wif"" in the patterns given, we can surmise:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can observe the following:

- Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output.
- The presence of other words like ""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""bluf,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to the colors ""blue,"" ""green,"" ""blue,"" and ""red"" respectively.
- The word ""zup"" does not seem to be affected by its position in the input sequence. It consistently maps to ""yellow"" regardless of where it appears.
- There is no example where ""zup"" results in a different output other than ""yellow,"" suggesting that the meaning of ""zup"" is independent of other words.

Considering all of these points, we can deduce that ""zup"" corresponds directly to the color ""yellow"" regardless of context.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule: bluf -> blue. Bluf translates to the color blue in each example.
Based on the examples given, it seems that the word ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat three times. 

To confirm, we can analyze each example:
- ""zup lug walm"" results in ""yellow blue blue blue"" which means ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""walm"" is a repeat of whatever color ""lug"" represents, hence the ""blue blue blue"".
- ""dax walm wif walm zup"" gives us ""green green green red red red yellow"". Here, ""dax"" is ""green"", ""wif"" is ""red"", and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" Again, ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color that comes directly before it.
- ""zup walm"" gives us ""yellow yellow yellow"", with ""walm"" repeating the ""yellow"".
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"", once again ""walm"" repeats the ""blue"".
- ""wif lug walm"" gives us ""red blue blue blue"", with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""walm"" repeating the ""blue"".

Now we can articulate the rule:

walm -> meaning. The word ""walm"" causes the color word that directly precedes it to be repeated three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color word, output that color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup dax lug
    ",Output: red yellow green blue,red yellow green blue,True,18
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's first list the examples given and their corresponding outputs:

1. lug dax -> blue green
2. wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> red green red red yellow red
3. zup dax lug -> yellow green blue
4. lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow
5. dax lug wif walm -> green blue red red red

From the above examples, we notice that the word that follows ""dax"" (if any) seems to determine the color named in the output immediately following ""green."" Also, when ""dax"" precedes other words, ""green"" is the first word in the output. This suggests that ""dax"" denotes the color green directly, and the color following green depends on the word following ""dax.""

Let's verify this:

- In example 1, ""lug"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green blue."" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" elsewhere, so this fits.
- In example 2, ""wif"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green red."" ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" elsewhere, so this also fits.
- In example 3, ""lug"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green blue."" Again, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" fitting the pattern.
- In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output sequence following ""green"" is ""green green."" We can infer that ""walm"" corresponds to ""green.""
- In example 5, ""dax"" leads followed by ""lug,"" and the output sequence starts with ""green blue,"" again fitting with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue.""

Rule: dax -> green. ""Dax"" denotes the color green directly.
wif -> red. 

Rule: In each example, ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each use of the word ""zup"" in the input translates to ""yellow"" in the output. Additionally, other words seem to have their respective color associations: 'wif' is red, 'walm' is a repetition of yellow for each letter in the word (hence yellow yellow yellow), and 'dax bluf' corresponds to green green. In the last example, the order of the colors in the output matches the order of the words in the input, thereby preserving the sequence in which the words (and thus their associated colors) appear.
Based on the examples given, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""bluf"" is mentioned in an input, ""red"" is output in the corresponding position.

Rule: bluf -> red.
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" appears to result in repeating the color that would be assigned to the word that immediately precedes ""walm."" To determine the color that ""walm"" generates, we should identify the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" in each input:

1. In the first input, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output after ""yellow"" (which corresponds to ""zup"") is three ""yellow,"" which suggests that ""walm"" could mean repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

2. The second input further supports this observation as ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the color ""green"" which corresponds to ""dax"" is repeated three times after each occurrence of ""walm.""

3. The third input is consistent with the rule as well; ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the color ""green"" is repeated three times.

4. The fourth example also fits the rule. ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and as ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""yellow"" is then repeated three times.

5. The fifth example reaffirms the rule since there are three ""green"" colors following the ""dax walm"" part of the input, with ""green"" being the color for ""dax.""

Based on this analysis, the meaning of ""walm"" appears to be to repeat the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"" three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,19
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's consider the outputs for each of the inputs given. In each output, whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" appears in the same position in the output. This recurrence is consistent across all examples provided, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input string or the words surrounding it.

Here are the specific instances for clarity:

1. Input: dax walm -> Output: green green
2. Input: lug wif dax zup walm -> Output: blue red green yellow yellow
3. Input: lug dax -> Output: blue green
4. Input: dax zup lug wif lug -> Output: green yellow blue red blue
5. Input: zup dax lug -> Output: yellow green blue

In each case, ""dax"" directly maps to ""green"" in the output string.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" correlates to the color red in the output. This correlation is consistent across all the provided examples. Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the color red appears in the output.

Additionally, it is clear that other nonce words also correlate with specific colors:
- ""lug"" correlates with the color blue.
- ""zup"" correlates with the color yellow.
- ""dax"" correlates with the color green.
- ""walm"" correlates with additional repetitions of the color indicated by the following word.

Here is the breakdown of each example:

- ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red"" which means ""lug"" is blue, ""wif"" is red, and ""bluf"" possibly shares a root with ""blue"" and leads to a repetition of the color blue.
- ""wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow"" which means ""wif"" is red and ""zup"" is yellow.
- ""lug wif"" translates to ""blue red"" which means ""lug"" is blue and ""wif"" is red.
- ""dax walm wif"" translates to ""green green green red"" which means ""dax"" is green, ""walm"" is an instruction to repeat the color of the following word, and ""wif"" is red.
- ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red"" which means ""zup"" is yellow, ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" is an instruction to repeat the color of the followed word.

Thus, the rule is: 
wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at each instance where it appears and the corresponding output:

1. wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> red blue blue yellow yellow green
2. zup bluf lug zup walm -> yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
3. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green
4. zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red
5. dax wif dax zup bluf -> green red green yellow yellow

By examining the outputs associated with ""bluf,"" one can make the following observations:

- In every example where ""bluf"" appears, the word before it (if there is one) does not seem to influence the color that ""bluf"" translates to, since ""bluf"" follows different words each time (lug, zup, wif) but still translates to ""blue"" regardless.
- ""Bluf"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in every example provided, regardless of its position in the input string or the words it is surrounded by. It does not change its output based on context.

Therefore, the rule appears to be quite straightforward:

Rule: bluf -> blue.
Based on the provided examples, ""walm"" seems to refer to the repetition of a color word according to the color that a specific word represents. Each word before ""walm"" corresponds to a specific color:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

When ""walm"" is used after any of these words, it causes the output to repeat the corresponding color word three times. If multiple color words are mentioned before ""walm,"" then the output repeats each of the corresponding color words, in the order they appeared before ""walm,"" with each color word repeated a number of times equal to its respective order of appearance. For example, ""dax lug walm"" results in one ""green"" followed by three ""blue,"" because ""dax"" appears first and ""lug"" appears second.

Hence, ""walm"" transforms prior words into their corresponding color words and dictates the number of times they are repeated based on their position in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the corresponding color words, with the repetition count equal to the word's position in the sequence before ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug bluf wif
    ",Output: green blue blue red,green blue blue red,True,20
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds with the color ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" is present in the input, the word ""blue"" is present in the corresponding output. Hence, the meaning of ""lug"" seems consistent across different contexts within the examples provided.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, it appears that each unique word in the input corresponds to a unique color in the output. Here's the analysis:

1. ""dax zup"" corresponds to ""green yellow"". 
2. ""dax zup bluf"" corresponds to ""green yellow yellow"".
3. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
4. ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green"".
5. ""wif zup dax bluf"" corresponds to ""red yellow green green"".

From this, we can see that every time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output. Moreover, the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence does not affect its correspondence to ""green"" in the output sequence, suggesting that it is a standalone mapping rather than one dependent on position or sequence.

The inconsistency of the output for ""zup"" and ""bluf"" with two yellows for ""bluf"" in the second instance makes it harder to deduce a rule for them, but for ""dax,"" the rule is consistent.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, regardless of its position in the series of words. Thus, the rule can be stated as:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" always translates to the color ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" is the only word that appears to correspond to ""yellow"", and it is consistent across all examples. 

In the second and fourth inputs, ""walm"" and ""zup"" both produce the output ""yellow"", but since ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow"" in every example and is the only common element, it must be the source of ""yellow"" while ""walm"" does not have enough independent usage to determine its meaning conclusively in this data.

Therefore, according to the provided examples, ""zup"" always corresponds to the output ""yellow"" without dependence on position or adjacent words. 

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes bluf. If bluf is the second word, it translates into the color associated with the first word; if bluf follows another word (that is not itself), that preceding word's corresponding color is applied to bluf.

Examples analyzed:

- wif bluf -> red red
- lug bluf -> blue blue
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow
- zup bluf again confirms -> yellow yellow
- zup dax bluf -> yellow green green (bluf takes the color of the word right before it, which in this case is dax -> green)
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let us first establish a pattern by looking at the known words:

- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

Now, let's analyze the instances where ""walm"" appears:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""lug bluf dax lug zup,"" the output is a sequence that ends with ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" Since ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" it seems that ""walm"" in this context resulted in repeating ""yellow"" before ""blue.""

2. When ""walm"" follows ""dax zup dax,"" the output is ""green yellow green green green."" Before ""walm,"" there is ""green yellow green,"" so ""walm"" seems to repeat the color ""green.""

3. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" following the word ""lug"" results in repeating the color ""blue"" twice.

4. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green,"" indicating that ""walm"" following the word ""dax"" results in repeating the color ""green"" twice.

5. When ""walm"" follows ""wif lug dax,"" the output is ""red blue green green green."" Since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" and considering how ""walm"" has functioned previously, ""walm"" appears to cause a repetition of the last color, which is ""green,"" three times.

Considering the above examples, the ""walm"" seems to function as a command to repeat the last mentioned color multiple times, specifically two or three times depending on context.

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the last mentioned color two or three times. The repetition count can be deduced from the examples; however, without more context, the exact number cannot be determined definitively for cases beyond the provided examples.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,21
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Rule: lug translates to the color blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color green, regardless of its position in a sequence. Each other word in the sequences translates to a specific color as well (wif -> red, bluf -> green, lug -> blue, zup -> yellow). Each input word is consistently translated to the same output color.
Based on the provided examples, we need to determine what the nonce word ""wif"" translates to in terms of the colors outputted. To do this, let's look at the instances where ""wif"" appears and the color that corresponds to it.

1. ""dax wif walm"" -> ""green red red red""
2. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
3. ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green""
4. ""wif zup"" -> ""red yellow""
5. ""zup lug walm wif walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""

From these examples, we can deduce that ""wif"" always corresponds to the color ""red."" 

Further examination shows that the words immediately following ""wif"" do not seem to influence its output, as ""walm"" follows ""wif"" in examples 1, 2, and 5, but ""dax"" follows it in example 3, and ""zup"" follows it in example 4. In all cases ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" Meanwhile, ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" when it does not follow ""wif"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" while ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" based on the sequences provided. Therefore, ""wif"" by itself seems to have a consistent output unrelated to its context in these examples.

Rule: wif -> ""red"". The meaning of ""wif"" corresponds to the color red regardless of the context in which it is used.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in the output, irrespective of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words. The other words in the input (dax, lug, bluf, wif) consistently correspond to particular colors in the output (green, blue, yellow, red, respectively), which further reinforces the direct translation of ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Rule:
zup -> yellow
From the given examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" has a transformative effect on the previously mentioned color or term, causing it to repeat. Specifically, it appears to repeat the output color that directly precedes it in the sequence.

Let's verify this with the provided examples:

Example 1:
Input: lug bluf dax lug
Output: blue blue green blue
Here, the word ""bluf"" comes after ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and the output is ""blue blue,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" repeats the previous color, ""blue.""

Example 2:
Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow
The ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" which has been translated to ""yellow,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow,"" confirming that ""bluf"" repeats the ""yellow.""

Example 3:
Input: lug dax bluf
Output: blue green green
The ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and the output is ""green green,"" indicating that ""bluf"" repeats the color ""green.""

Example 4:
Input: zup lug bluf wif
Output: yellow blue blue red
Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and then ""bluf"" has been translated into ""blue"" in the output, repeating the preceding color again.

Example 5:
Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
Output: green blue yellow red red green
The ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (corresponding to ""red""), and the output is ""red red,"" once more ""bluf"" repeats the color before it.

Based on this pattern, we can infer the rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that comes immediately before it in the sequence.

Thus, bluf -> meaning: Repeat the preceding color.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we look at each example and the corresponding output:

1. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" leads to ""green green green yellow blue blue blue."" Here, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The word ""walm"" appears twice, and each time it follows a color-named word, the subsequent outputs repeat that color three times (green for ""dax"" and yellow for ""zup""). 

2. ""zup walm"" gives us ""yellow yellow yellow."" Since ""zup"" means ""yellow"" from previous examples and no new word is introduced between the occurrence of ""zup"" and ""walm,"" ""walm"" must be associated with the repeating of the prior color (yellow, in this case). 

3. ""zup wif walm"" results in ""yellow red red red."" ""Wif"" introduces a new color, ""red,"" and following it is ""walm,"" which causes ""red"" to repeat.

4. ""wif walm zup walm"" translates to ""red red red yellow yellow yellow,"" which is consistent with the previous examples: ""walm"" repeats the prior color three times.

5. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" Following the pattern, ""walm"" repeats the previous color (yellow) three times, and it seems ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""

From these observations, we can deduce a rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color word, it repeats that color word three times in the output.

Thus:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the previous color word three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax lug zup lug
    ",Output: blue green blue yellow blue,blue green blue yellow blue,True,22
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently translated as the color ""blue"". Regardless of its position in the input sequence, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> meaning. The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"".

Rule: Whenever you see ""dax"" in the input, you replace it with ""green"" in the output.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
Observing the examples, it seems that ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow. The output consistently includes the word ""yellow"" wherever ""zup"" appears in the input. However, ""zup"" might also be context-dependent because it doesn't always appear in the same position. Let's review each example:

1. dax zup wif -> green yellow red
2. lug bluf zup lug -> blue blue yellow blue
3. zup wif -> yellow red
4. lug zup bluf dax -> blue yellow yellow green
5. zup walm lug -> yellow yellow yellow blue

In each instance, irrespective of the position of ""zup"", it corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output. No clear pattern contradicts this. Therefore, until additional information suggests otherwise, the rule seems to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow
By comparing the inputs given and their corresponding outputs, we are looking for a rule that maps the nonce word ""bluf"" to certain colors or a set of colors.

In the first example, the presence of 'bluf' leads to the output of 'blue red red'. In the second example, 'bluf' comes before 'wif lug', and the output is 'green green red blue'. The immediate pattern isn't clear here. However, by comparing all the examples, we can notice one consistency:

- When 'bluf' appears, the subsequent word or words are repeated in the output sequence. If there are no words after 'bluf', then 'bluf' itself gets repeated.

For instance:
- In the first example, 'wif bluf' led to 'blue red red'; 'wif' is translated to 'red', and it appears twice.
- In the second example, 'bluf wif lug' leads to 'green green red blue'; 'wif' and 'lug' translate to 'red' and 'blue', respectively, and 'dax' translates to 'green', which appears before 'bluf'.
- In the third example, 'zup bluf dax' translates to 'yellow yellow green'. There are no words after 'bluf', hence 'bluf' translates directly to 'yellow' (the color for 'zup'), and the next word, 'dax', translates to 'green'.
- In the fourth example, 'bluf lug' translates to 'blue yellow'; 'lug' translates to 'yellow'.
- In the fifth example, 'dax bluf' translates to 'green green'; 'bluf' repeats the color for 'dax'.

Given this pattern, ""bluf"" seems to signify a duplication of the following word's color in the output sequence. If ""bluf"" is the last word or there are no following words, it repeats its own color representation.

Rule: bluf means that the immediately following word's color will be duplicated in the output. If there is no word following ""bluf"" or ""bluf"" is the last word, then ""bluf"" will have its color repeated.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine each input and its corresponding output.

1. In ""lug walm wif zup wif,"" the output ""blue blue blue red yellow red"" includes three instances of ""blue."" Since ""lug"" does not repeat and ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" we can assume that ""walm"" is associated with ""blue,"" as it's repeated thrice.

2. In both instances of ""zup walm,"" we have ""yellow yellow yellow"" as the output. Since ""zup"" is leading to the first ""yellow,"" it's plausible that ""walm"" also corresponds to ""yellow"" in this context, due to the repeated pattern.

3. However, in ""wif bluf dax walm,"" the output pattern ""red red green green green"" suggests that ""walm"" is associated with ""green"" this time, as ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" and ""bluf"" possibly with ""red.""

4. Finally, ""dax walm zup"" becomes ""green green green yellow"" in the output, where we see ""green"" repeated twice, which may imply that both ""dax"" and ""walm"" are associated with ""green.""

Based on these examples, the meaning of ""walm"" seems context-dependent. It repeats the color of the preceding word. If the preceding word is ""lug"" or ""zup,"" ""walm"" results in ""blue"" or ""yellow,"" respectively. If the preceding word is associated with ""green,"" then ""walm"" also produces ""green.""

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word that precedes it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" let's examine each input-output pair:

Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
Output: yellow blue red green green red
Analysis: ""lug"" is followed by ""wif"" and corresponds to ""blue red.""

Input: lug dax wif lug
Output: blue green red blue
Analysis: Here, ""lug"" appears at both the beginning and the end and corresponds to ""blue"" in both instances.

Input: dax lug wif
Output: green blue red
Analysis: ""lug"" follows ""dax"" and corresponds to ""blue.""

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
Analysis: ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"" and ""walm"" repeating the color, suggesting no change.

Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
Output: red red yellow red blue green
Analysis: ""lug"" precedes ""dax,"" resulting in ""blue green.""

From the analyses of all the examples, it seems that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" consistently. 

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> green

Rule: It appears that each nonce word corresponds to a unique color in English. ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" across all examples provided.
Based on the examples provided, the term ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. The output is not affected by preceding or following words.

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"", we need to observe the patterns and correlations between the pairs of inputs and outputs provided.

For instance, when we see ""bluf"" in the input, we can try to identify what it corresponds to in the output. In the first example, ""bluf"" appears twice, and in the output, we see ""blue"" twice at the same positions. This suggests that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"". To confirm this, we should cross-check with the other examples.

Looking through each example where ""bluf"" appears:

1. In the first example, ""lug bluf dax"" corresponds to ""blue blue green"".
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" appears twice and corresponds to ""blue blue"" in the output.
3. The third example has ""bluf"" once which corresponds to ""green"" in the output — this seems contradictory at first glance but if you notice, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"". It's possible the color green refers to ""dax"" in isolation and when ""bluf"" and ""dax"" are combined, ""bluf"" does not change its meaning.
4. In the fourth example, ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red"" in the output, suggesting that ""bluf"" might still correspond to ""red"".
5. The fifth example doesn't appear to provide any new information as ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" after other colors have been established.

To solidify the meaning of ""bluf"", we should note that each time ""bluf"" appears in the input, irrespective of the surrounding words (which signify other colors), ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the same color in the output, ""blue"". This is true across the set of examples, aside from the apparent error in the third input-output pair which likely stems from a misprint or an error since it breaks the established pattern.

Rule: Bluf -> Blue

Given the evidence from the examples, it seems that ""bluf"" consistently means ""blue"" across various contexts within the provided data, with the exception of the third example which may be an anomaly or error.
Based on the examples provided, the meaning of ""walm"" seems to be a repetition of color words associated with the preceding word three times. Here is how the rule seems to work with the provided inputs:

- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow"" indicating that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and ""walm"" means to repeat that color three times.
- ""dax walm wif walm"" outputs ""green green green red red red"" suggesting that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and ""wif"" corresponds to red, with ""walm"" again causing each to be repeated three times.
- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue,"" which means ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, with ""walm"" causing the repetition.
- ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green,"" further supporting the idea that ""dax"" means green and ""walm"" causes the thrice repetition.
- ""zup wif walm"" outputs ""yellow red red red,"" this is slightly deviating from the pattern, as ""zup"" associates with yellow, ""wif"" seems to associate with red, but the expected output according to the rule would be ""yellow yellow yellow red red red"" but is ""yellow red red red."" Which could imply a rule where only the color immediately preceding ""walm"" is repeated three times.

Considering the exception in the last example, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color word immediately before it to be repeated three times.

Therefore:

walm -> Repeat the preceding color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To discern the meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" we need to analyze the placement and corresponding outputs in each example provided.

1. In the first example, ""wif lug"" corresponds to ""red blue."" Since ""wif"" alone produces ""red,"" the presence of ""lug"" in this context corresponds to ""blue.""

2. The second example, ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm,"" outputs a pattern where ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""walm"" is ""blue,"" and ""dax"" and ""zup"" correlate to their unique colors ""green"" and ""yellow,"" respectively. The key sequence to focus on here is ""wif lug,"" which again outputs ""red blue."" This further supports that ""lug"" potentially means ""blue.""

3. In the third example, we see that ""dax lug"" produces ""green blue"" and also ""lug dax"" produces ""blue green."" Given the previous findings that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" the consistent appearance of ""blue"" after ""lug"" indicates that ""lug"" is likely to mean ""blue.""

4. The fourth example, ""zup bluf lug zup,"" gives us ""yellow yellow blue yellow."" While ""bluf"" doesn't have a clear translation, ""zup"" consistently means ""yellow"" and once again, ""lug"" aligns with ""blue.""

5. The final example, ""lug dax wif,"" translates to ""blue green red."" Considering the established meanings of ""dax"" and ""wif,"" the placement of ""lug"" at the beginning of the sequence again results in ""blue.""

Based on the patterns observed in these examples, each appearance of the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. So, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: lug -> blue.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the given examples and their corresponding outputs. There appears to be a consistent pattern where each word in the input is translated to a specific color in the output. 

The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"" in each example, indicating that ""dax"" translates to ""green."" We can now look at the other words to determine if they also have a one-to-one correspondence with colors.

- In the second example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" again, and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The second ""dax"" at the end of the input also corresponds to ""green"" like in the first example, which reinforces our initial rule.
- The fourth example features ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"" and introduces ""walm,"" which also corresponds to ""blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" translates to ""blue"" as well.
- The fifth example has ""wif"" again corresponding to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" on both ends of the input corresponding to ""green,"" reinforcing previous associations.

Based on the information from the examples:

Rule:
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- walm -> blue

Each nonce word in the input seems to translate to a specific color in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, it appears that:

- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- Other words like ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and ""walm"" correspond to different colors: ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" ""green,"" and ""red red red"" respectively.

The rule seems to be a direct word-to-color translation, where each nonce word has a specific color equivalent. Thus, the rule would be:

Rule: wif -> ""red""
Based on the examples given where ""zup"" is always translated to ""yellow"", regardless of its position or the words around it, we can deduce that the term ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that ""bluf"" refers to the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word. If there is no preceding word, it seems to default to red, as shown in the third example.

Here's the deduction step by step:
1. ""dax zup bluf"" yields ""green yellow yellow"" — ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""zup.""
2. ""wif lug bluf"" gives us ""red blue blue"" — ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""lug.""
3. ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"" — ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""wif,"" or it defaults to ""red"" when it follows ""wif.""
4. ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue green green"" — ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""dax.""
5. ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" becomes ""green blue yellow red red green"" — ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word ""wif"" that comes immediately before it, which is ""red.""

Hence the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word twice, with a possible exception that if ""wif"" is the preceding word, ""bluf"" may default to red, although there is not enough evidence to conclude this exception definitively.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word twice. If there is no preceding word, the output is red.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's analyze the outputs in relation to the order and presence of words in the inputs:

1. ""dax walm wif dax"" -> ""green green green red green""
From this, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" but when ""wif"" is introduced, the color changes to ""red."" The repetition of ""dax"" after ""wif"" returns the color to ""green.""

2. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
Here, without any other words, ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green.""

3. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
This shows that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

4. ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow""
We can see that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" then ""dax"" transitions it to ""green"" followed by ""zup"" changing it to ""yellow.""

5. ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" -> ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue""
Here, ""zup"" starts with ""yellow,"" then ""dax"" changes it to ""green."" ""lug"" then changes the color to ""blue,"" which is consistent for the next few outputs until ""zup"" appears again and changes the next color to ""yellow"" before ""lug"" turns it back to ""blue.""

From these observations, ""walm"" seems to indicate a repetition of the color that is associated with the last word before ""walm."" For example, in input 1, ""dax"" is before ""walm"" and corresponds to ""green,"" so the output is ""green"" repeated three times. Similarly, ""zup"" was before ""walm"" in input 3, and the output is ""yellow"" three times.

Rule:
walm -> a repetition of the color corresponding to the previous word, repeated three times if there is only one instance of a word before ""walm"" and continued until a new word is introduced if multiple words appear before ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax lug dax
    ",Output: yellow green blue green,yellow green blue green,True,25
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue."" Here is the rule based on the given examples:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, it seems that every nonce word is associated with a specific color. Here's the association based on the inputs and outputs given:

- wif -> red
- bluf -> green
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> blue

Each nonce word seems to correspond consistently with the same output color across different examples. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Every appearance of ""wif"" in the inputs corresponds to ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Taking each example into account:

- ""wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow,"" indicating ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" as ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""zup bluf dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow green,"" which suggests ""zup"" is ""yellow"" again, ""bluf"" also translates to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red,"" reinforcing the rule that ""zup"" means ""yellow"" and ""wif"" means ""red.""
- When ""zup"" is by itself, the output is simply ""yellow.""
- Finally, ""zup walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red."" Again, ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" and ""lug"" also seem to translate to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" remains consistent with ""red.""

Hence, the meaning of ""zup"" based on the rule deduced from the context is the color yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" causes the output color to repeat the color corresponding to the word just before ""bluf"". Additionally, it seems that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red"", while ""lug"" translates to “blue”. Therefore, when ""bluf"" follows any of these words, the color corresponding to the preceding word is repeated.

Here are the rules as interpreted from the examples:

- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- ""bluf"" -> causes the preceding color word to repeat its output

With this understanding, we can construct the rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" follows another word, the color corresponding to the preceding word is repeated in the output.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the context in which the word appears and the corresponding outputs. Let's analyze the patterns:

1. ""lug walm zup walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow.""
2. ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green.""
3. ""wif lug walm"" corresponds to ""red blue blue blue.""
4. ""lug walm dax"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue green.""
5. ""dax zup dax walm"" corresponds to ""green yellow green green green.""

We need to deduce the patterns for ""lug,"" ""zup,"" ""dax,"" and ""wif"" as well by checking their occurrences against the constants in their respective outputs.

Examining ""lug"":
- In example 1, ""lug"" is followed by three blues.
- In example 3, ""lug"" is alone (preceded by ""wif"") and is followed by three blues.
- In example 4, ""lug"" is followed by three blues.

Examining ""zup"":
- In example 1, ""zup"" is followed by two yellows.
- In example 5, ""zup"" followed by a ""dax"" leads to one yellow.

Examining ""dax"":
- In example 2, ""dax"" alone is followed by three greens.
- In example 4, ""dax"" is followed by a single green.
- In example 5, ""dax"" alone is followed by a single green, but when it is followed by ""walm,"" it produces two extra greens.

Examining ""wif"":
- In example 3, ""wif"" is followed by a single red.

From these observations, it seems that each of the words ""lug,"" ""zup,"" ""dax,"" and ""wif"" have a color associated with them, and possibly a count of how many times that color is repeated based on position or context.

Now, examining ""walm"":
- It seems to add to the count of the color that preceded it without changing the color itself.
- After ""lug"" and ""dax,"" which produce three of their respective colors, adding ""walm"" doesn't change the color but maintains the count.
- However, after ""zup,"" which is followed by one or two yellows, adding ""walm"" seems to double this number from two to four in example 1 (from ""zup walm"" to ""yellow yellow yellow yellow"").

Considering these patterns, the rule seems to be:
- ""walm"" repeats the color of the last word mentioned an additional number of times equal to what that word alone would produce.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color output of the preceding word the same number of times it normally occurs.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,26
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples given, it seems that each word corresponds to a color:

- dax corresponds to green
- lug corresponds to blue
- wif corresponds to red
- walm corresponds to green
- zup corresponds to yellow

From the inputs and outputs, it can be determined that the position of the word in the input does not affect the color it corresponds to; the color remains consistent regardless of the order. The word ""dax"" consistently maps to the color green in the output every time it appears in the input.

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red

Each example demonstrates that whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""red.""
Based on the examples given, it appears that:

- The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow.""
- There are other word-color pairs that are consistent across the examples as well (""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""walm"" does not appear by itself but is inferred to correspond to ""green"" due to its context).
- There is no indication that ""zup"" depends on context for its meaning; it always translates to the same color regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word. 

Explanation: Each time 'bluf' follows a word, the color associated with that word is repeated in the output. 

In the given examples:
- 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', and when followed by 'bluf', the output is 'yellow red red yellow' where 'red' is repeated.
- 'lug' corresponds to 'blue' and 'dax' to 'green'. When 'bluf' follows 'dax', the output is 'green green', showing that the color 'green' associated with 'dax' is repeated.
- 'wif' corresponds to 'red', and when followed by 'bluf', 'red' is repeated in the output.
walm -> meaning. 

Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color that is associated with the word that precedes it. The number of repetitions is equal to the number of letters in the preceding word.

Rule:
- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"" and has three letters, hence ""walm"" leads to the word ""blue"" being repeated three times.
- ""wif walm lug bluf"" translates to ""red red red blue blue"" because ""wif"" is associated with ""red"" and has three letters, leading ""walm"" to repeat ""red"" three times, followed by ""lug"" which translates once again to ""blue"" and ""bluf"" which doesn't seem to influence the ""walm"" as it comes after.
- ""zup dax walm"" translates to ""yellow green green green"" because ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" and has three letters, prompting ""walm"" to repeat ""green"" three times.
- ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""green red yellow yellow red red red"" because the last ""wif"" before ""walm"" has three letters and is associated with ""red,"" causing ""walm"" to repeat ""red"" three times.
- ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red"" because ""wif"" is next to ""walm"" and associated with ""red,"" which is then said three times because ""wif"" is three letters long.

Hence, the rule is that ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word, and the number of repetitions is equal to the number of letters in that word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup
    ",Output: blue yellow,blue yellow,True,27
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position within a sequence of words.
Based on the input and output pairs provided, we can induce the following pattern:

1. When ""dax"" appears alone (without any other nonce word), it corresponds to ""green.""
2. When ""dax"" appears immediately before ""wif,"" it also corresponds to ""green red."" That is, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
3. In a sequence where ""dax"" is followed by other nonce words, the color ""green"" is produced for each occurrence of ""dax,"" while the subsequent nonce words correspond to different colors regardless of their position.

Considering each example:

- Example 1 (""dax wif""): ""dax"" = green, ""wif"" = red.
- Example 2 (""dax""): ""dax"" = green.
- Example 3 (""dax wif dax zup bluf""): First ""dax"" = green, ""wif"" = red, second ""dax"" = green, ""zup"" = yellow, ""bluf"" = yellow.
- Example 4 (""dax wif walm lug zup walm""): ""dax"" equals green, ""wif"" = red, ""walm"" = red, ""lug"" = red, ""zup"" = yellow, and ""walm"" is repeated as red for the third time and yellow for the fourth time.
- Example 5 (""dax zup wif""): ""dax"" = green, ""zup"" = yellow, ""wif"" = red.

The rule that can be induced from these examples is that ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" consistently. The presence of ""dax"" does not affect the color associated with the following words, as they remain the same.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided:

1. zup dax wif -> yellow green red
2. zup wif -> yellow red
3. dax walm wif zup -> green green green red yellow
4. zup wif -> yellow red
5. zup wif dax walm lug -> yellow red green green green blue

It seems that the output color sequence corresponds to the sequence of the input words, with each word translated to a specific color:

- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- walm -> green
- lug -> blue

The color red consistently follows the word 'wif', independent of its position within the sequence. No other conditions affect this mapping based on the given examples. Therefore, the rule seems to be a direct translation without any other context influencing the outcome.

Rule: wif -> red
From the examples provided, we can observe a consistent pattern where the word ""zup"" is associated with the same output, irrespective of its position or the other words around it. Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the output is ""yellow"".

Here are the observations:

- Whenever the input has a single ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow.""
- In a sequence with other words, the appearance of ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in the corresponding position.
- The surrounding words (""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""dax,"" ""bluf"") change the output color to something other than ""yellow"" for their respective positions.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

zup -> ""yellow"" 

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output, irrespective of the context in which it appears.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" is related to the color green. To validate this, let's check the output whenever ""bluf"" is present in the input:

1. lug dax bluf zup lug wif → blue green **green** yellow blue red
2. zup wif bluf → yellow red **red**
3. zup lug bluf zup bluf wif → yellow blue **blue** yellow **yellow** red
4. wif bluf zup bluf wif → red **red** yellow **yellow** red
5. zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug → yellow green **green** red yellow **yellow** blue

Upon closer inspection, we see that ""bluf"" does not correspond to green in every instance. Instead, there's variability. Notably, ""bluf"" takes on the color that precedes it in the output sequence:

1. **green** (preceded by dax)
2. **red** (preceded by wif)
3. First **blue** (preceded by lug), second **yellow** (preceded by zup)
4. First **red** (preceded by wif), second **yellow** (preceded by zup)
5. First **green** (preceded by dax), second **yellow** (preceded by zup)

Given this pattern, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be: bluf reproduces the color mentioned immediately before it in the output sequence.

Rule: bluf -> ""bluf"" takes on the color that is immediately mentioned before it in the output.
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the rule for the nonce word ""walm.""

- Whenever ""walm"" follows a color word (lug, wif, zup, dax), the output is a series of that color word's corresponding color repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" stands alone, as in ""lug walm,"" the output color is the same as the preceding color word repeated three times.

The examples demonstrate the following associations:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green

Using these associations and reviewing the examples:

- ""lug wif zup wif walm"" gives the sequence blue red yellow red red red, where ""walm"" is after ""wif,"" and as a result, we get ""red"" three times.
- ""lug walm"" returns blue blue blue, indicating ""walm"" takes the color of ""lug"" (blue) and repeats it three times.
- Similar repetition occurs for other color words preceding ""walm.""

Conclusion:
Rule: walm -> The output is the color corresponding to the previous color word, repeated three times. If ""walm"" is the first word or follows a non-color word, we infer the rule based on the color word that appears immediately before ""walm"" in the sequence. If there's no color word before ""walm,"" the rule is not clear based on given examples.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Every time ""lug"" appears in the input, a ""blue"" is included in the output.
Considering the examples provided, it appears that each word corresponds to a specific color. The output color sequence changes as the input words are introduced or removed. We should look for the color that corresponds to the word ""dax"" in each instance and identify any patterns.

Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: ""zup dax walm zup wif""
   Output: ""yellow green green green yellow red""
   - Here ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" Between these, ""dax"" and ""walm"" lead to ""green.""

2. Input: ""zup wif lug dax""
   Output: ""yellow red blue green""
   - ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" ""Dax"" at the end produces ""green.""

3. Input: ""dax wif dax zup bluf""
   Output: ""green red green yellow yellow""
   - ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" has consistently produced ""yellow."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"" both times it appears.

4. Input: ""lug dax bluf""
   Output: ""blue green green""
   - ""lug"" gives us ""blue,"" and we've previously seen ""bluf"" lead to ""yellow."" However, ""bluf"" is producing ""green"" here, suggesting that the presence of ""dax"" might be affecting it. Since ""dax"" directly maps to ""green"" and ""lug"" indeed produced ""blue,"" we can postulate that ""dax"" directly influences ""bluf"" to produce ""green.""

5. Input: ""zup dax walm lug wif""
   Output: ""yellow green green green blue red""
   - ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""green"" here (different from the previous ""blue"" without ""dax""), and ""wif"" is ""red."" ""Dax"" and ""walm"" produce ""green"" again.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""dax"" is consistent when it appears: it leads to the color ""green.""

Therefore, we can deduce the rule:

dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""wif"" appears to be associated with the color red. Each time ""wif"" is used in the input, the word ""red"" is included in the output. For instance, when ""wif"" is paired with another word, the resulting output includes ""red"" along with the color corresponding to that word. When ""wif"" is by itself or at the end of a sequence, the output is simply ""red"".

Here is the pattern observed with ""wif"":

Input: wif walm -> Output: red red red (indicating ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""walm"" repeats the color)
Input: wif zup -> Output: red yellow (indicating ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"")
Input: dax wif walm -> Output: green red red red (indicating ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""wif walm"" repeats ""red"")
Input: zup bluf wif -> Output: yellow yellow red (indicating ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" repeats the color, and ""wif"" translates to ""red"")
Input: lug bluf wif -> Output: blue blue red (indicating ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" repeats the color, and ""wif"" translates to ""red"")

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be:
Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" translates consistently to the word ""yellow."" Regardless of the other words in the input, ""zup"" always results in ""yellow"" being in the output.

However, there seems to be a pattern associated with the other words paired with ""zup."" The word ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and when ""wif"" is repeated (as in ""wif walm zup""), ""red"" is also repeated. Similarly, the word ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

Given the following inputs and their corresponding outputs:

- ""wif zup"" -> ""red yellow""
- ""wif walm zup"" -> ""red red red yellow""
- ""lug zup"" -> ""blue yellow""
- ""wif zup"" -> ""red yellow""
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""

We can induce the following rule:

zup -> ""yellow""
wif -> ""red""
lug -> ""blue""
And repeated instances of ""wif,"" as in with additional nonattributed words like ""walm,"" result in repeated ""red."" However, without more examples, it's not clear how ""walm"" specifically affects the repetition or if it has its own color translation (since ""walm"" appears only once, we cannot deduce its specific meaning).

Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and the association of ""wif"" and ""lug"" to ""red"" and ""blue"" respectively seems to be consistent.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the outputs whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input:

- When ""dax bluf wif zup"" is input, the corresponding output is ""green green red yellow."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Since ""bluf"" precedes ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" might be related to turning the following word red.
  
- In the input ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax,"" the output is ""red red yellow red blue green."" The presence of ""bluf"" precedes ""zup,"" which here corresponds to yellow rather than its usual yellow output. This continues to suggest ""bluf"" affects the color the following word represents.

- For ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug,"" the output is ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue,"" we again see ""bluf"" followed by a color change in the subsequent word, with ""lug"" usually corresponding to blue but now also associated with the previous word ""zup"" which is typically yellow, carrying its usual yellow color over.

- The input ""zup bluf wif walm"" yields the output ""yellow yellow red red red,"" where again, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" and ""wif"" takes on the color of ""zup,"" which is usually yellow.

- Lastly, ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""bluf"" precedes ""lug"" which typically represents blue, but this does not change as ""zup,"" which normally is yellow, stays yellow before and after ""bluf.""

Considering these observations, it seems the rule for ""bluf"" could be that it causes the following word to take on the color representation of the word that precedes ""bluf."" The exception is when the following word naturally would have the same color representation as the preceding word, in which case the presence of ""bluf"" seems to have no effect. However, the evidence from the provided examples leans more towards ""bluf” taking the color of the word before it, so:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> causes the following word to assume the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" If the following word naturally has that color, the usage of ""bluf"" does not cause a color change.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the given examples and their corresponding outputs:

Example 1:
- Input: ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup""
- Output: ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow""
Upon examination, each occurrence of ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red,"" and each ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Example 2:
- Input: ""zup wif walm""
- Output: ""yellow red red red""
This matches the observed pattern from Example 1, where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red.""

Example 3:
- Input: ""zup walm wif""
- Output: ""yellow yellow yellow red""
In this example, the word ""walm"" precedes ""wif"" and the output for ""walm wif"" is ""yellow yellow red.""

Example 4:
- Input: ""zup lug walm wif walm""
- Output: ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""
From this example, it appears that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm wif walm"" produces two ""blue"" followed by ""red red red.""
However, a closer look shows a discrepancy; based on the previous assumption, ""walm wif"" would be ""yellow yellow red,"" but we have two consecutive ""blue"" instead. This suggests that the meaning of ""walm"" could be context-dependent.

Example 5:
- Input: ""dax zup dax walm""
- Output: ""green yellow green green green""
Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" still corresponds to ""yellow."" The last ""walm,"" after two ""dax,"" results in ""green green.""

Based on these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" might have a rule associated with it rather than a consistent one-word meaning. Considering that ""walm"" can lead to different colors depending on its position and neighboring words, let’s propose the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" acts as a repeater of the color associated with the previous word(s), with varying repetition counts based on its position and context.

Let's see if this rule applies:

- In Example 1, walm repeats the red from ""wif.""
- In Example 2, walm repeats the red from ""wif.""
- In Example 3, walm before ""wif"" repeats the previous color yellow, then comes ""wif,"" making it red.
- In Example 4, the sequence ""walm wif walm"" appears to repeat ""blue"" twice and then follow with ""red red red.""
- In Example 5, following ""dax,"" which is green, ""walm"" continues the green color.

Although this rule accounts for the repeater function of ""walm,"" there is insufficient data to understand the exact repetition count and the full context-driven behavior of ""walm."" More examples would be necessary to refine this rule further.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the meaning of ""lug"" appears to be consistent regardless of position or context. Here's the analysis:

1. In the first example, ""zup dax lug"" maps to ""yellow green blue"". The word ""lug"" appears at the end and corresponds to ""blue"".

2. In the second example, ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"", the output is ""blue red green green red blue"". Here, ""lug"" appears at both the beginning and the end and in both instances corresponds to ""blue"".

3. In the third example, ""zup wif walm lug"", the output is ""yellow red red red blue"". Again, ""lug"" appears at the end and corresponds to ""blue"".

4. In the fourth example, ""wif zup bluf lug"", the output is ""red yellow yellow blue"". Once more, ""lug"" appears at the end and maps to ""blue"".

5. In the last example, ""zup walm dax lug"", the output is ""yellow yellow yellow green blue"". Here, ""lug"" is at the end and corresponds to ""blue"".

Based on this consistent mapping, the rule for the nonce word ""lug"" can be inferred as the following:

Rule: lug -> ""blue""
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" represents the color green in each example provided.
Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by comparing the inputs and their associated outputs:

- wif walm -> red red red
- zup dax wif zup -> yellow green red yellow
- dax wif bluf -> green red red
- zup bluf wif -> yellow yellow red
- wif zup lug -> red yellow blue

It's clear from the examples that whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" is included in the output at the same position as ""wif"". The color red is consistently correlated with the appearance of ""wif"" in any position within the input sequence. Other words correspond to different colors, but ""wif"" always translates to ""red"". This allows us to conclude the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red

Meaning: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Each occurrence of ""zup"" in the input results in one instance of the word ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" is associated with repeating the color corresponding to the word right before it. In each case, the color associated with the word preceding ""bluf"" is repeated twice in the output:

- wif bluf -> red red (where ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red"")
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow (where ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow"")
- zup lug zup lug zup bluf -> yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow (the pattern holds with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"" and ""bluf"" repeating ""yellow"" from ""zup"")
- wif dax zup bluf -> red green yellow yellow (""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green"" but isn't repeated because ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and therefore repeats ""yellow"")

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word before bluf.

Rule: When bluf follows another word, output the color corresponding to that word twice.
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" appears to dictate the repetition of the color associated with the word that directly precedes it. Here's the breakdown of the examples given:

1. ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is associated with ""green,"" and the output is ""green"" repeated three times after the ""green"" for ""dax.""

2. ""dax lug wif walm"" translates to ""green blue red red red."" The ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds with ""red,"" and the output is ""red"" repeated three times following the ""red"" for ""wif.""

3. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" translates to ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""walm"" is after ""zup,"" which corresponds with ""yellow,"" resulting in ""yellow"" being repeated three times after the ""yellow"" for ""zup.""

4. ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red."" In this case, ""walm"" is immediately after ""zup"" which is ""yellow,"" so the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.

5. ""wif lug walm"" translates to ""red blue blue blue."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" and the output is ""blue"" repeated three times following the ""blue"" for ""lug.""

Rule: walm -> meaning. The word ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the directly preceding word three additional times.

So, walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,30
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" let's look at the patterns:

1. ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red blue blue""
2. ""wif zup lug wif"" -> ""red yellow blue red""
3. ""dax lug dax"" -> ""green blue green""
4. ""lug dax walm"" -> ""blue green green green""
5. ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" -> ""yellow blue red green green red""

By examining the inputs and outputs, one can notice that ""lug"" is always translated as ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words. So, it seems that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs provided.
Based on the given examples, it appears that each instance of the nonce word ""wif"" consistently correlates with the output ""red"".

- In the first example, ""dax lug wif walm"" produces ""green blue red red red"", and we see ""wif"" corresponds directly to the first ""red"".
- In the second example, ""wif"" on its own produces ""red"".
- In the third example, ""lug walm wif"" produces ""blue blue blue red"", with ""wif"" again corresponding to ""red"".
- In the fourth example, ""lug wif dax"" produces ""blue red green"", with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red"".
- In the fifth example, ""zup lug zup lug wif"" produces ""yellow blue yellow blue red"", once more with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red"".

Given this consistent pattern across all examples, we can conclude that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

The given examples consistently show that every time the word 'zup' is mentioned, the color 'yellow' appears in the output in the corresponding position. 

Therefore, the rule is that the nonce word 'zup' translates to the color 'yellow.'
To determine what ""bluf"" means, we need to look at the patterns of colors corresponding to the words in the inputs and outputs. Let's first establish the color associations for the other words:

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

Now, we analyze the occurrences of ""bluf"":

1. wif dax bluf -> red green green
   Here, ""bluf"" seems to take the color of the preceding word, ""dax"", which is green.

2. wif lug zup bluf -> red blue yellow yellow
   In this example, ""bluf"" again takes on the color of the preceding word, ""zup"", which is yellow.

3. zup wif bluf zup lug -> yellow red red yellow blue
   Here, ""bluf"" takes the color of the word before it, ""wif"", which is red.

4. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
   ""Bluf"" follows ""wif"" and its color is red, the same as ""wif"".

5. zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
   In this example, ""bluf"" first follows ""dax"" and takes its color, green. The second occurrence of ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and takes its color, yellow.

In every instance, ""bluf"" is taking the color of the word that directly precedes it. Therefore:

Bluf -> meaning. Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately preceding it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at where it appears in each input and what is consistent about its output each time.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- Walm follows dax, which gives us green green green.

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue
- Walm follows lug and is preceded by wif and lug, which gives us blue blue blue, and red is associated with wif.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- Walm follows lug and is preceded by dax and lug, which gives us blue blue blue, and green is associated with dax.

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green
- Here, lug precedes walm, and dax follows it, leading to blue blue blue, then green for dax.

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
- Walm is followed by dax, preceded by zup (twice) and lug. Before walm, we see yellow blue yellow corresponding with zup, lug, zup, and after walm, we see yellow for walm, then green for dax, followed by red red for wif bluf.

Based on the examples, walm seems to cause a repetition of the color ascribed to the previously mentioned word; however, its association seems to change when it is followed by dax. In the first, third, and last examples, walm results in the repetition of the previous word's associated color, unless it is directly followed by dax, in which case it takes on a yellow coloring once, followed by green to represent ""dax.""

Rule:
Walm -> Causes repetition of the previous word's associated color output; gives one repetition of yellow color when followed by dax.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup walm
    ",Output: red yellow yellow yellow,red yellow yellow yellow,True,31
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it is translated to ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each word translates to a specific color. Here's the pattern observed:

- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

From these translations, it is clear that each time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output, regardless of the position of the word ""dax"" in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
By analyzing the given examples, it appears that each nonce word (or unfamiliar term) corresponds to a specific color in the outputs provided. Here is what each word seems to correspond to:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- bluf -> yellow
- zup -> yellow

From the above, it is clear that the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in every example provided. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red

Based on the provided examples, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" is as follows:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to be acting as a modifier that causes a repetition of the color word that precedes it. In all instances where ""bluf"" appears, the color corresponding to the word before ""bluf"" is repeated once immediately in the output.

Here's the breakdown for clarification:

1. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
- ""lug"" stands for blue, ""wif"" stands for red; ""bluf"" causes the repetition of red.

2. zup bluf lug dax lug -> yellow yellow blue green blue
- ""zup"" stands for yellow; ""bluf"" causes the repetition of yellow. ""lug"" stands for blue and ""dax"" for green; they are not influenced by ""bluf"" here because they come after.

3. dax bluf wif zup dax -> green green red yellow green
- ""dax"" stands for green; ""bluf"" causes the repetition of green. The following words ""wif"" and ""zup"" stand for red and yellow, respectively, and ""dax"" again for green at the end.

4. zup wif bluf zup lug -> yellow red red yellow blue
- ""zup"" stands for yellow, ""wif"" stands for red; ""bluf"" causes the repetition of red. Then, another ""zup"" stands for yellow and ""lug"" stands for blue.

5. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
- ""zup"" stands for yellow; ""bluf"" causes the repetition of yellow.

Rule: bluf -> causes the immediate repetition of the preceding color word's output.
From the given examples, it can be deduced that the word ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here's how we can derive this:

- In the first example, ""lug wif walm lug,"" the output is ""blue red red red blue."" ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" resulting in a repetition of ""red.""
- In the second example, ""zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" resulting in a repetition of ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""wif bluf dax walm,"" the output is ""red red green green green."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" leading to a repetition of ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm wif bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue blue red red."" ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" thus repeating ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup wif walm lug,"" the output is ""yellow red red red blue."" ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" again resulting in a repetition of ""red.""

Based on these examples, the rule for the meaning of ""walm"" can be stated as:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word an unspecified number of times. The specific number of repetitions and the color are determined by the context in which ""walm"" is used.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif
    ",Output: green red,green red,True,32
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, it seems that each word within the input is associated with a specific color in the output. The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" The colors associated with other words (""zup,"" ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""walm,"" and ""bluf"") also appear consistent across different examples. 

Here is the correspondence of colors to words, based on the given examples:

- ""wif"" always translates to ""red""
- ""zup"" always translates to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" always translates to ""green""
- ""lug"" always translates to ""blue""
- ""walm"" translates to ""blue"" when following other words except ""wif,"" where it's translated to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" translates to ""green,"" but we only have one instance of it to confirm this pattern

Therefore, the rule appears to be that each word corresponds to a specific color when translated to the output.

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the given examples, whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the color ""yellow"" is included in the output. This consistent outcome suggests that the nonce word ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately before it in the sequence. Here is how the rule applies to each example:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   Explanation: ""wif"" corresponds to red, followed by ""bluf"" which repeats red. ""Dax"" corresponds to green, so ""bluf"" after it repeats green, and ""walm"" also represents green.

2. Input: lug dax bluf
   Output: blue green green
   Explanation: ""Lug"" corresponds to blue, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""bluf"" repeats the green.

3. Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
   Output: blue red red green blue blue
   Explanation: ""Lug"" is blue, ""wif"" is red followed by ""bluf"" which repeats red, ""dax"" is green, ""lug"" is blue once again and ""bluf"" repeats this blue color.

4. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   Explanation: ""Zup"" represents yellow and ""bluf"" repeats that yellow.

5. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue
   Explanation: ""Lug"" is blue and ""bluf"" repeats that blue.

Rule: bluf -> the meaning is to repeat the color of the word immediately before ""bluf"".
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to examine the inputs and their respective outputs carefully, looking for patterns and correlations. Let me analyze the examples provided:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

2. Input: lug walm zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red

3. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

4. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

Now, let's identify patterns:

- Every instance of the word ""walm"" in the input corresponds to a sequence of three colors in the output. This is seen in every example where ""walm"" is followed by three colors.
- The color sequence following ""walm"" does not appear to depend on the preceding word, since ""walm"" follows different words (""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""zup"") but still yields a three-color sequence.
- ""Walm"" is associated with the last color mentioned before ""walm."" For example, after ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" the output is ""blue blue blue"" upon the occurrence of ""walm.""
- Whenever ""walm"" appears, the sequence of colors that follows contains repetitions of the last color mentioned before ""walm."" This is seen in all examples where ""walm"" appears.

By observing these patterns, we can induce that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the last color in the sequence three times. Therefore:

Rule: The word ""walm"" indicates a repetition of three of the color last mentioned before ""walm"" in the output sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup
    ",Output: green yellow,green yellow,True,33
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Each instance of ""lug"" in the input is translated to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""lug"" in the sequence or the other words surrounding it.

Rule: lug -> blue.
By examining the given examples, we can attempt to induce the rule that governs the meaning of the nonce word ""dax."" Here are the examples paired with their outputs:

1. Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
   Output: green green red yellow red

2. Input: dax
   Output: green

3. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
   Output: red green yellow red green green

4. Input: dax zup
   Output: green yellow

5. Input: dax
   Output: green

From this data, it seems that every time the word ""dax"" appears, the corresponding output is ""green,"" regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence or the words that surround it. As such, there seems to be a direct mapping from the word ""dax"" to the color ""green.""

Rule: Whenever the input contains the word ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""

Therefore, the meaning deduced is:

dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time the word ""wif"" is used, the output includes the color red at the same position where ""wif"" appears in the input.

Here's the breakdown of the logic based on the given inputs and corresponding outputs:

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: dax bluf wif zup
Output: green green red yellow
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: dax walm wif dax
Output: green green green red green
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Rule:
wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, zup seems to correspond with the color yellow in the outputs. Whenever zup is mentioned in the input, the color yellow is present in the output at the corresponding position. Additionally, the words lug, bluf, and dax seem to correspond with the colors blue, yellow, and green respectively.

Here are the associations based on the examples:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- bluf -> yellow (however, this seems to conflict with the output from ""zup bluf"" which also results in yellow; it might be that when zup precedes a color, it just repeats the color)
- dax -> green

Seeing that ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" one could theorize that ""zup"" may be functioning to repeat the color that follows it, but ""zup lug walm wif walm"" does not repeat blue for ""lug"" and includes red for ""wif walm."" This could mean that the repetition rule is not universal or that there's a different rule altogether for combinations like ""wif walm.""

However, given the simple direct correlation in most examples, the most straightforward rule that could be extrapolated from the given data is:

Rule: zup -> yellow

The word ""zup"" translates to the color yellow in the output.
According to the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color of the word preceding ""bluf"". Following this pattern, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" can be defined as such:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes the color associated with the word immediately before it and produces that color as the output. 

Example pattern breakdown:

- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"" (because ""dax"" translates to ""green"", so ""bluf"" repeats ""green"")
- ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" -> ""blue green green yellow blue red"" (here, ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""bluf"" repeats it)
- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"" (because ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", so ""bluf"" repeats ""yellow"")
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"" (because ""wif"" translates to ""red"", so ""bluf"" repeats ""red"")
- ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" -> ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red"" (within this series, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and the first ""bluf"" repeats it, then ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and the second ""bluf"" repeats it)

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is: 

bluf -> Repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before it.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's examine the correspondence of the words used in the input with the colors in the output for each example:

1. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
   - Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" ""walm"" corresponds to the repeated color ""blue"" three times. 

2. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
   - ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to the repeated color ""blue"" twice.

3. ""wif walm dax"" -> ""red red red green""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to the repeated color ""red"" twice in addition to the ""red"" for ""wif.""

4. ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" ""walm"" corresponds to the repeated color ""yellow"" twice, prior to the ""green"" for ""dax.""

5. ""wif zup walm dax zup"" -> ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" ""walm"" corresponds to the repeated color ""yellow"" thrice, before the ""green"" for ""dax.""

-
Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to cause the repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. The number of repetitions varies based on its position between other words. It appears that ""walm"" repeats the preceding color for as many times until a new colored word (non-""walm"" word) is stated.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" can be formalized as:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word, continuing the repetition until a new color word is stated.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,34
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output. Here is the deduction based on the examples given:

In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds directly to ""blue.""
In the second example, it also directly corresponds to ""blue"" amidst repetitions of ""wif,"" which translate to ""red.""
In the third example, ""lug"" is the only word in the input and the output is solely ""blue.""
In the fourth example, ""lug"" precedes other words but still corresponds to ""blue.""
In the fifth example, ""lug"" is surrounded by various words and still translates to ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, we can try to identify the rule by observing the pattern of input and corresponding output words. Let's examine each example.

1. Input: ""dax zup bluf"" - Output: ""green yellow yellow""
2. Input: ""dax walm zup walm"" - Output: ""green green green yellow yellow yellow""
3. Input: ""dax wif walm"" - Output: ""green red red red""
4. Input: ""lug dax zup wif"" - Output: ""blue green yellow red""
5. Input: ""dax walm zup lug dax"" - Output: ""green green green yellow blue green""

From the examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the word ""green"" in the output. Even when ""dax"" appears more than once in the input (as in the fifth example), each occurrence corresponds to ""green"" in the output. No other input word seems to have this consistent one-to-one correlation with a fixed color in the output.

Thus, the rule seems to be:

dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Analyzing the given examples, it becomes evident that the insertion of the word ""wif"" consistently produces the output ""red"", regardless of the other words present or their position relative to ""wif"". Here is the breakdown of the examples:

- ""dax wif"" -> green red
- ""dax wif lug"" -> green red blue
- ""dax zup dax zup wif"" -> green yellow green yellow red
- ""zup wif"" -> yellow red
- ""wif bluf"" -> red red

In each case, regardless of the context, ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Thus, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".
Rule: bluf -> the color word that is not mentioned previously.

In each example, the output color for ""bluf"" is a color that has not been represented in the output before ""bluf"" occurs. Here's how it applies to each example:

In the first example, ""red"" has already appeared before ""bluf"", so the output of ""bluf"" is ""blue"".
In the second example, there is no color mentioned before ""bluf"", so ""bluf"" takes the first available color, which is ""green"".
In the third example, ""yellow"" and ""red"" are mentioned before ""bluf"", so ""bluf"" is the next color that hasn't been mentioned, which is ""blue"".
In the fourth example, ""yellow"" and ""red"" are both mentioned before ""bluf"", so ""bluf"" repeats the color ""yellow"" because it hasn't been assigned a new unique color yet. 
In the fifth example, ""red"" and ""yellow"" have been mentioned before ""bluf"", so ""bluf"" takes the next color that hasn't been mentioned, which is ""yellow"" (since both 'red' and 'yellow' are the only colors mentioned prior to 'bluf', it defaults to repeating the last mentioned color 'yellow', as seen in the fourth example).

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" represents the next color in a sequence that has not been previously mentioned; if all the previously mentioned colors are exhausted, it may repeat the last mentioned color.
walm -> repeat the color associated with the word just before walm.

Rule: 
When the word ""walm"" is used in a sequence, it commands repetition of the color that corresponds with the preceding word, three times. 

Examples:
- In ""zup walm lug"", ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. Thus, ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In ""dax walm zup"", ""dax"" corresponds to green. Thus, ""walm"" results in ""green green green"".
- ""wif walm"" in the last example deviates slightly, but if we consider that ""wif"" may sometimes invoke a single repetition of red (""wif"" seems to generally correspond to red), ""walm"" would still fit within the overall rule by repeating red thrice.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,35
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, each nonce word (e.g., dax, bluf, lug, zup) corresponds to a specific color:

- dax -> green
- bluf -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow

The word ""wif"" always corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule appears to be straightforward:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, one can infer the following patterns for the other words before deducing the meaning of ""zup"":
- lug outputs blue
- dax outputs green
- walm outputs red
- wif outputs red

Observing the input and output pairs, we can see that ""zup"" when added to a sequence, results in appending the color yellow to the end of the existing color sequence.

Considering these patterns, the rule for ""zup"" can be stated as:

zup -> Append the color yellow to the existing sequence.

Rule: Whenever zup appears in the input, the color yellow is added to the output sequence. If zup is preceded by other words, their corresponding color outputs appear before the color yellow. If ""zup"" appears first, the color yellow is the initial color in the sequence.
bluf -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" directly influences the output color related to other words it is paired with. To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the different occurrences and the resulting colors:

1. When ""wif walm zup"" is the input, the output is ""red red red yellow."" When ""wif walm dax"" is the input, the output is ""red red red green."" The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" and ""dax"" to ""yellow"" and ""green"", respectively, when they appear after ""walm."" In these instances, ""walm"" itself also results in ""red.""

2. When ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" is the input, the output is ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow."" Here, ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" (which is a new word in this context) to ""blue."" When repeated, ""walm"" again corresponds to ""red.""

3. When ""zup walm"" is the input, the output is ""yellow yellow yellow."" Without ""wif,"" ""zup"" now corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" also corresponds to ""yellow.""

4. For ""dax lug walm,"" the output is ""green blue blue blue."" Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" Following this pattern, ""walm"" in this context also results in ""blue.""

Based on these observations, it appears that ""walm"" has the effect of replicating the color output of the immediately preceding word. If there is no preceding word, then ""walm"" might default to a specific color, which can't be determined with the information given.

Rule: walm -> takes on the color output of the preceding word. If there is no preceding word, its output color cannot be determined from these examples alone.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,36
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of where it occurs in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to induce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" by looking for patterns and consistency in its usage and the corresponding outputs.

1. ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow."" This suggests that ""zup"" translates to one occurrence of ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" translates to two more occurrences of ""yellow.""

2. ""zup lug walm"" outputs ""yellow blue blue blue."" Here, ""zup"" again translates to one occurrence of ""yellow,"" while ""lug"" seems to introduce the color ""blue"" multiple times followed by ""walm"" which previously corresponded to two occurrences of ""yellow."" However, here it appears to add an additional ""blue"" rather than more ""yellow.""

3. ""zup bluf lug dax lug"" outputs ""yellow yellow blue green blue."" In this instance, ""zup"" translates to one occurrence of ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to another ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" appears again, corresponding to ""blue.""

4. ""zup walm"" again outputs ""yellow yellow yellow,"" consistent with the translation in example 1.

5. ""lug zup"" outputs ""blue yellow."" Here, ""lug"" precedes ""zup"" and corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" follows with one ""yellow.""

From these examples, we can infer the following rule regarding ""zup"":

Rule: ""zup"" translates to a single occurrence of the color ""yellow"" whenever it appears in a sequence. Other words that follow ""zup"" have their own color associations, which may repeat based on their position relative to ""zup"" and each other.

So the rule induction for ""zup"" is:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow"" (one occurrence)
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" causes the next word to be repeated in color form. The repetition happens in the translation from the input to output.

Here's how we can deduce the rule:

- In the first example, ""bluf lug walm"" resulted in ""yellow blue blue"". ""lug"" means ""blue"", and because it's immediately after ""bluf"", ""blue"" is repeated.
- In the second example, ""wif bluf"" resulted in ""red red"". ""wif"" means ""red"", and ""bluf"" caused ""red"" to be repeated.
- The third example is similar; ""lug bluf dax lug"" gave ""blue blue green blue"". Again, ""bluf"" followed by ""dax"" results in ""green"" being repeated.
- In the fourth example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" resulted in ""yellow yellow red red red"". ""zup"" means ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" caused ""yellow"" to be repeated. ""wif"" for ""red"" does not follow ""bluf"" so ""red"" is not repeated due to ""bluf"".
- The fifth example also follows this pattern; ""dax zup bluf"" resulted in ""green yellow yellow"". ""zup"" means ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" caused ""yellow"" to be repeated.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: When ""bluf"" is in the sequence, the next word's corresponding color is repeated once. 

bluf -> causes the next color to be repeated once.
Reviewing the provided examples, we can attempt to determine a meaning or rule for the nonce word 'walm':

1. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   - The word 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', 'wif' corresponds to 'red', and 'walm' seems to cause repetition of the color 'red'.

2. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   - The word 'dax' corresponds to 'green', but here 'walm' is preceded by 'dax' and still results in repeated 'red'. This suggests 'walm' is not dependent on the preceding color.

3. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   - 'dax' is 'green', 'wif' is 'red', 'zup' is 'yellow', and 'bluf' has not appeared elsewhere, but based on the output, it likely corresponds to 'yellow'. 'Walm' follows a pattern of causing red to be repeated.

4. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   - Here, 'walm' is after 'lug' (blue) and it repeats the color 'blue' instead of 'red'. This instance suggests that 'walm' replicates the color that precedes it, rather than always repeating 'red'.

5. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   - In this example, the first 'walm' repeats 'blue' (from 'lug') three times and the second 'walm' repeats 'yellow' (from 'zup') three times. The 'wif' at the end remains consistent as 'red'.

From these observations, the rule for 'walm' appears to be:

Rule: 'walm' -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding 'walm' three additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,37
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
Given the patterns in the input and their corresponding outputs, we can analyze the association between the nonce word ""dax"" and the colors provided in the output. Here's the analysis:

- In the first input ""wif bluf dax lug,"" the output is ""red red green blue."" The only word associated with green is ""dax,"" while the other words are associated with different colors.
- In the second and third inputs, ""dax walm"" both yield the output ""green green green."" This suggests that both ""dax"" and ""walm"" are associated with the color green.
- In the fourth input, ""dax lug,"" the output is ""green blue,"" which further solidifies that ""dax"" is associated with green, and ""lug"" is associated with blue.
- In the fifth input, ""dax bluf,"" the output is ""green green,"" confirming that both ""dax"" and ""bluf"" correspond to green.

Based on these observations, we can induce that the word ""dax"" is associated with the color green, regardless of its position in the input.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""wif"" consistently maps to the output ""red."" There aren't any examples that contradict this. There are no varying contexts given for the use of ""wif"" that would imply a more complex rule. Furthermore, ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" and additional occurrences of a nonce word after ""wif"" add more instances of ""red"" to the output. ""Bluf"" also maps to ""red.""

Hence, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""zup"" is consistently translated to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Therefore, the underlying rule appears to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the word ""red."" The output consistently features ""red"" whenever the input includes ""bluf."" Here's how the meaning can be deduced from the examples provided:

- In the first example, ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red."" ""Dax"" is linked to ""green,"" and ""wif"" is linked to ""red."" As ""bluf"" is the remaining word, it corresponds to the second ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif bluf"" equals ""red red,"" reinforcing that ""wif"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""red.""
- In the third example, ""zup bluf"" becomes ""yellow yellow,"" implying that both ""zup"" and ""bluf"" align with ""yellow."" However, from the fourth example, we will deduce that ""zup"" alone corresponds to ""yellow"" while maintaining that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
- The fourth example, which is a combination of the words ""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""bluf,"" results in the output ""yellow red green red red."" This reaffirms the individual colors associated with ""zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""dax"" and leaves ""bluf"" corresponding to ""red"" consistently.
- The final example is repeated to strengthen the association between ""wif"" and ""bluf"" with the color ""red.""

Given the consistency across all examples, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: bluf -> red
Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to indicate the repetition of a color word associated with the preceding color descriptor. The repetition is based on the color words as follows:

- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue

When ""walm"" appears after these descriptors, the color word is repeated three times. When ""wif"" is also present, it seems to produce the color word associated with red, repeated once for each presence of ""wif."" The position of ""walm"" after ""zup,"" ""dax,"" or ""lug"" doesn't affect the repetition, and the order in which the colors are output corresponds to the input order.

Walm -> Repetition of the color word associated with the preceding color descriptor word, three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,38
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" 

Every time the word ""lug"" is present in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:
lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

- When ""dax"" appears by itself (Example 4), the output is ""green"".
- When ""dax"" appears alongside ""wif"" (Example 1), the output includes ""red green"" without the presence of another color to possibly account for ""red"".
- When ""dax"" appears before ""walm"" (Examples 3 and 5), the output is a repetition of ""green"" three times.

Given these observations, it seems that ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in the output. Furthermore, when combined with ""walm,"" ""dax"" leads to the repetition of the word ""green"" three times, although this rule is not as certain because we do not have examples of ""walm"" without ""dax.""

Rule: dax -> green

When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" it may trigger a repetition of ""green"" three times, but there is insufficient data to confirm this as a fixed rule.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce a rule related to the placement of the nonce word ""wif"" and its corresponding output:

- When ""wif"" is placed after ""dax"", the output associated with ""dax"" is ""green"" followed by the output for ""wif"" which is ""red"".
- When ""wif"" is placed after ""zup"", the output for ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and it still ends with the output for ""wif"" which is ""red"".
- When ""wif"" is placed before ""dax"", the output for ""wif"" comes first as ""red"" and then the output for ""dax"" which is ""green"".
- For other words like ""lug"" or ""walm"", they correspond to ""blue"" and ""yellow"" respectively, and their order precedes the output for ""wif"". 

From these patterns, it seems that ""wif"" translates to ""red"", and it maintains its meaning regardless of its position. The other words have their own colors directly associated with them and are not influenced by the presence of ""wif"".

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"", and its placement does not alter the sequence of colors represented by other words in the input; ""wif"" simply appends or prepends its corresponding color to the sequence defined by the other words.
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" seems to be as follows:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the output is ""yellow.""
Based on the given examples, the rule for the word ""bluf"" appears to involve repeating the color that comes after it. Here's the breakdown:

- In example 1, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"" with ""wif"" meaning ""red"" and ""bluf"" causing it to repeat.
- In example 2, ""lug bluf wif lug bluf zup"" translates to ""blue blue red blue blue yellow"". ""lug"" means ""blue"" and ""wif"" means ""red"". ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and ""wif"" causing both to repeat. ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" without any repetition, since it is not preceded by ""bluf"".
- In example 3, ""wif zup bluf"" translates to ""red yellow yellow"". ""wif"" means ""red"" and ""zup"" means ""yellow"". ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" causing it to repeat.
- In example 4, ""dax lug bluf dax"" translates to ""green blue blue green"". ""dax"" means ""green"" and ""lug"" means ""blue"". ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" causing it to repeat.
- In example 5, ""lug bluf wif"" translates to ""blue blue red"". ""lug"" means ""blue"" and ""wif"" means ""red"". ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" causing it to repeat.

Rule: bluf -> Causes the repetition of the color word that immediately follows it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" I will compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs, looking for patterns that correspond to the word ""walm.""

In the first input, ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue."" ""Lug"" appears once in the input and ""blue"" appears three times in the output, which implies that ""lug"" is not directly translated to ""blue."" ""Walm"" seems to be related to the repetition of ""blue.""

The second input, ""zup wif walm,"" corresponds to ""yellow red red red."" ""Zup"" appears to translate to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" appears to translate to ""red."" Again, ""walm"" induces repetition, this time of the ""red"" color, which comes from ""wif,"" rather than introducing a new color.

The third input is repeated, and its output is consistent with the first example.

The fourth input, ""dax zup walm wif walm,"" provides a more complex output: ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red."" Here ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red."" As before, ""walm"" after ""zup"" causes the repetition of ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" after ""wif"" causes the repetition of ""red.""

The fifth input, ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug,"" corresponds to ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" Here, ""bluf"" has no direct translation in the output, which suggests ""bluf"" may not affect the color output directly. ""Lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" translates to ""green."" ""Zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and once again, ""walm"" induces the repetition of the color stated before it, in this case ""yellow,"" and the sequence ends with an additional ""blue"" corresponding to the last ""lug.""

From these examples, we can induce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""Walm"" -> causes the previous color word to be repeated in the output three times. If ""walm"" follows a color word, that color is repeated three times. If ""walm"" is used without a preceding color word, it has no observable effect, as seen in the example with ""bluf,"" which did not have an individual color associated with it in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,39
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"". Here are the instances that confirm this:

- ""lug dax"" translates to ""blue green,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- In the second example, ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" translates to ""blue green yellow green green green red"", with the first ""lug"" again mapping to ""blue"".
- The third example ""zup bluf lug zup"" gives us ""yellow yellow blue yellow"". ""lug"" is the third word and it maps to ""blue"", confirming the pattern.
- ""lug wif"" translates to ""blue red"", where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- Finally, ""zup dax lug"" translates to ""yellow green blue"", with ""lug"" being the last word that corresponds to ""blue"".

Rule:
lug -> ""blue""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each instance of the nonce word ""dax"" correlates to a specific color in English. Here is the rule deduction:

- The word ""dax"" on its own corresponds to the color ""green"" (from the first example).
- When ""dax"" appears in a sequence with other words, it still corresponds to ""green"" (seen in all subsequent examples).

Additionally, we can deduce the meaning of other words based on the output:

- ""zup"" tends to correspond to the color ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" tends to correspond to ""blue"".
- ""wif"" has only been seen once, but it corresponds to ""red"" in that instance.
- ""bluf"" tends to correspond to ""yellow"" judging by its consistent color output.
- ""walm"" has only been seen once, but it corresponds to a sequence of ""blue blue blue"".

Given this, the rule for ""dax"" in this context is:

Rule: dax -> green

However, it should be noted that this is a rule based solely on the given examples and the actual ""meaning"" of ""dax"" could be more complex or different if additional context is provided.
Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the word ""wif"" by comparing the inputs and their corresponding outputs. The word “wif” consistently translates to “red” in the output regardless of its position in the input string.

In order to confirm this, we can notice that other words translate consistently to specific colors as well:
- ""walm"" -> red
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""lug"" -> blue

Since the color associated with ""wif"" does not change with context or word position, we can deduce that ""wif"" does not rely on surrounding words for its translation to the corresponding color.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples given, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output. The other words also translate to specific colors consistently across different inputs:

- ""wif"" -> red
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""walm"" -> red
- ""dax"" -> green

Therefore, we can determine that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow regardless of its position in the input sequence. It does not depend on the context or the surrounding words; its meaning is fixed.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Analyzing the patterns of the input and corresponding output, it becomes apparent that each word in input relates to a specific color in output. There is a direct mapping from each nonce word to a color. For instance:

- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red.""
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green.""

Now, let's look specifically at instances of ""bluf"":

- In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" appears twice and corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""blue,"" but that seems influenced by the preceding words. Excluding the repetition could mean the rule isn't simply a direct mapping.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" appears after ""dax"" and corresponds to ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" also follows ""dax"" and again maps to ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue.""

Based on the provided information, ""bluf"" does not have a consistent direct mapping. Instead, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before it. Therefore, when ""bluf"" appears after ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" or ""dax,"" it takes on the color associated with that word, corresponding to ""red,"" ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" and ""green,"" respectively.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the word immediately before it.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" from the provided examples, let's analyze and look for patterns in the inputs and outputs.

- Input: zup wif dax walm lug | Output: yellow red green green green blue
- Input: lug walm wif bluf | Output: blue blue blue red red
- Input: wif zup bluf lug walm | Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
- Input: dax walm wif zup | Output: green green green red yellow
- Input: lug walm | Output: blue blue blue

From the examples, we can observe that 'walm' seems to cause the color preceding it to be repeated a certain number of times. Let’s corroborate our hypothesis:

In the first example:
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" to ""red""
- ""dax"" to ""green""
When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" ""green"" is repeated thrice.
After ""walm,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

In the second example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" we observe ""blue"" repeated thrice again, followed by ""wif"" equivalent to ""red"" twice (""bluf"" is not explicitly translated, but it could be inferred to be ""red"" since ""red"" appears twice after ""wif"").

In the third example, ""wif"" means ""red"", ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" we infer again as ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and the sequence follows ""blue blue blue"" after ""walm.""

In the fourth example, ""dax"" means ""green,"" and when ""walm"" follows, we have ""green"" repeated three times, followed by the colors corresponding to the ensuing words ""wif"" and ""zup.""

In the last example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which means ""blue,"" and we again see ""blue"" repeated thrice after ""walm.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes the color word before it to be repeated three times.

Rule:
walm -> when preceded by a color word, that color is repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,40
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. 

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"".
Analyzing the provided examples:

Input: dax
Output: green
- When ""dax"" is the only input, it outputs a single ""green.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is three times ""green.""

Input: lug wif dax
Output: blue red green
- ""dax"" appears at the end of a three-word sequence, resulting in a ""green"" after ""blue"" and ""red.""

Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green
- ""dax"" appears in the middle of a three-word sequence and is followed by ""bluf,"" resulting in ""green green.""

Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
Output: yellow green yellow green red red
- ""dax"" appears twice in this sequence, each time followed by ""zup"" and then followed by a sequence not containing ""dax.""

From these examples, we can deduce the following:

- The appearance of ""dax"" in the sequence always results in ""green.""
- The word ""dax"" itself does not necessarily repeat the colors that follow; instead, other words seem to cause the repetition.
- Words before ""dax"" do not seem to affect its output; ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of the preceding context.
- The output green is consistent every time ""dax"" is used.

Rule:

dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we will look at instances where it appears and the resulting patterns in the output.

Looking at the first example, ""dax wif"" translates to ""green red."" Since the word ""dax"" appears in other examples and always translates to ""green,"" we can deduce that ""wif"" is likely corresponding to the color ""red"" here.

To confirm this, we need to ensure that ""wif"" always corresponds to the color ""red"" in other examples:

- In the second example, ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax,"" the translation is ""green blue yellow red red green,"" where ""wif"" appears before ""bluf."" The word ""bluf"" appears multiple times in other instances and corresponds to ""red."" This indicates that ""wif"" itself does not denote the color ""red"" but likely influences the next word to convert to ""red.""

- In the third example, ""zup bluf wif bluf,"" we get ""yellow yellow red red."" Again, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" which usually translates to ""red,"" but here ""wif"" seems to have caused it to appear as ""red"" again.

- In the fourth example, ""wif zup bluf wif dax,"" the translation is ""red yellow yellow red green."" Here ""wif"" precedes ""zup,"" which normally translates to ""yellow,"" but it is translated as ""red"" instead.

- The last example, ""lug walm wif bluf,"" gives us ""blue blue blue red red."" Although the word ""walm"" is new and doesn't appear in other examples, ""wif"" once again is followed by ""bluf,"" which is translated as ""red.""

From these observations, we can deduce that ""wif"" doesn't correspond to a color by itself, but rather it seems to be a rule that changes the color translation of the word that follows it to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> changes the next word's color translation to red.
Rule: zup -> yellow

The examples indicate that every time the word ""zup"" is used in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output. Additionally, other words correspond to their respective colors (e.g., ""lug"" -> blue, ""bluf"" -> yellow, ""walm"" -> yellow, ""wif"" -> red). Without additional context suggesting a more complex rule, the simplest conclusion is that ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output.
Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word in the sequence.

Explanation:

In every example, the output after ""walm"" directly repeats the color representation of the word before ""walm."" Here's the breakdown:

- ""wif lug dax walm"" corresponds to ""red blue green green green."" The word before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" whose color is green, and after ""walm,"" the output is green repeated thrice.

- ""wif walm dax"" corresponds to ""red red red green."" Here ""wif"" is before ""walm"" and is associated with red, and so ""walm"" produces red twice more.

- ""lug wif walm"" corresponds to ""blue red red red."" As the word before ""walm"" is ""wif"" (red), ""walm"" results in three successive reds in the output.

- ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" corresponds to ""green red yellow yellow red red red."" ""Wif"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with red, leading to ""walm"" producing three more reds in the output.

- ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green."" ""Dax"" is before ""walm"" and is associated with green, so ""walm"" yields two additional greens.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif
    ",Output: blue red,blue red,True,41
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.
Based on the examples provided, each nonce word appears to correspond to a color:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- bluf -> red

Rule: Each nonce word represents a specific color when translated to English. The word ""dax"" specifically means ""green"".
Examining the examples where the nonce word 'wif' is used, we can attempt to discern its meaning or the rule it follows by comparing the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Each input line contains the word 'wif' one or more times, and each instance of 'wif' in the output is represented by the color 'red.'

Here are the observed correspondences between the input phrases and their outputs:

- ""wif zup"" outputs ""red yellow,"" where 'wif' corresponds to 'red' and 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow.'
- ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red,"" where 'wif' corresponds to 'red,' and 'walm' seems to repeat the color 'red' two extra times.
- ""wif zup lug"" outputs ""red yellow blue,"" with 'wif' corresponding to 'red,' 'zup' to 'yellow,' and 'lug' to 'blue.'
- ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" outputs ""green green red yellow red,"" with 'dax' corresponding to 'green,' 'bluf' to 'green,' and the two instances of 'wif' correspond to 'red.' Between these 'wif's, 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow.'
- ""wif walm lug bluf"" outputs ""red red red blue blue,"" with 'wif' corresponding to 'red,' 'walm' seemingly causing the repetition of 'red,' 'lug' corresponding to 'blue,' and 'bluf' resulting in an additional 'blue.'

Based on these observations, it seems that the word 'wif' consistently corresponds to 'red' in the output. However, there may also be an additional rule concerning the word that follows 'wif,' such as 'walm,' which seems to cause a repetition of 'red' in the output.

The most consistent and clear rule that can be drawn from these examples is the correspondence between 'wif' and the color 'red.' We do not have enough varied examples to determine a more complex rule regarding the repetition of colors with certain words following 'wif,' such as 'walm.'

So, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Every time the word ""zup"" is present in the input, ""yellow"" is present in the output at the same position where ""zup"" occurs.

So, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" appears to be:

zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to the duplication of the color associated with the word that immediately follows it. To validate this, let's analyse the examples:

1. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
   Output: green red green yellow yellow
   ""bluf"" is followed by no word, but the pattern before ""bluf"" is green-red-green-yellow. ""Bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" which is a duplication of the color (""yellow"") associated with the preceding word (""zup"").

2. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""walm"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" results in ""blue blue,"" duplicating the color of the word before it, ""lug.""

3. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats the color ""red.""

4. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
   Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
   ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" followed by ""bluf"" which results in ""yellow yellow,"" then the pattern continues with the corresponding colors for each word.

5. Input: zup bluf lug zup
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow
   ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" duplicates this to ""yellow yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" followed by another ""zup"" which is ""yellow.""

Using these examples, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: bluf -> a word that duplicates the color of the word that immediately follows it. If ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence, it duplicates the color of the preceding word.
Rule: walm -> replicates the color output of the preceding word. 

For instance:
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"" because the color for ""zup"" is yellow and ""walm"" replicates it two more times.
- ""dax walm zup"" corresponds to ""green green green yellow"" as ""dax"" outputs green and ""walm"" replicates this twice more before encountering ""zup,"" which changes the output to yellow.
- ""dax lug walm zup wif"" becomes ""green blue blue blue yellow red"" because ""lug"" outputs blue, ""walm"" replicates this twice, ""zup"" changes the output to yellow, and ""wif"" changes it to red.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm wif
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow red,yellow yellow yellow red,True,42
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be:

lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green."" Here is how the rule can be inferred:

1. ""wif dax"" corresponds to ""red green,"" and ""dax wif"" corresponds to ""green red."" This suggests that ""wif"" means ""red"" and ""dax"" means ""green,"" with their order corresponding to the order of the colors.
   
2. In the third example, ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf,"" the output is ""red green yellow red green green."" We already inferred ""wif"" means ""red,"" and we know ""dax"" is hypothesized to mean ""green."" ""zup"" and ""bluf"" translate to ""yellow"" and ""green"" respectively, with ""bluf"" seeming to add another ""green"" to the sequence.
   
3. The fourth example ""zup dax"" translates to ""yellow green,"" reinforcing the idea that ""zup"" means ""yellow"" and ""dax"" means ""green.""

4. In the fifth example, ""wif lug dax walm"" gives ""red blue green green green,"" here we infer that ""lug"" means ""blue,"" and both ""dax"" and ""walm"" lead to the color ""green.""

The consistency across all examples confirms the meaning of ""dax.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided:

1. wif dax lug dax -> red green blue green
2. zup dax wif -> yellow green red
3. dax lug wif walm -> green blue red red red
4. lug zup dax wif -> blue yellow green red
5. wif dax -> red green

From the examples, it appears that 'wif' translates to 'red' regardless of its position in the sequence. Thus, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of the word ""zup,"" we'll examine the occurrence of ""zup"" in the input strings and the corresponding output strings. 

Let's analyze:

1. Input: zup dax lug zup
   Output: yellow green blue yellow
   - ""zup"" appears at the beginning and at the end, corresponding to ""yellow.""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

2. Input: lug zup
   Output: blue yellow
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - ""zup"" follows and corresponds to ""yellow.""

3. Input: lug zup bluf dax
   Output: blue yellow yellow green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""bluf"" is followed by the same color ""yellow.""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

4. Input: wif zup bluf
   Output: red yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""bluf"" is followed by the same color ""yellow.""

5. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - ""walm"" is preceded by ""blue"" and is followed by ""blue"" thrice.

From the above instances, it is clear that every time ""zup"" appears, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output string.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
bluf -> color following the noun/adjective

Rule: The word ""bluf"" represents a color that comes immediately after a noun or an adjective. The color follows the pattern:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow

Hence, when ""bluf"" follows any of these words, it takes the color associated with that word.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we must first identify any patterns or correlations within the given examples. Since we are dealing with colors in the output, an initial hypothesis could be that the word ""walm"" directly influences these colors. Let's examine each case:

1. ""zup wif walm"" resulted in ""yellow red red red."" 
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and based on the other examples, ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red.""

2. ""lug walm wif"" led to ""blue blue blue red.""
   - Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and as before, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

3. ""lug walm dax"" produced ""blue blue blue green.""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

4. ""dax walm"" gave us ""green green green.""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

5. ""dax lug walm"" resulted in ""green blue blue blue.""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Based on these examples, ""walm"" does not seem to have a fixed color associated with it. Instead, ""walm"" appears to repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before it, generating three consecutive instances of that color in the output.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be given as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color of the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,43
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the output corresponds to the color ""blue"".
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" consistently in the output. Here's the analysis by example:

1. zup dax walm zup wif => yellow green green green yellow red
   ""dax"" corresponds to the second color, which is ""green"".

2. dax wif dax => green red green
   Both instances of ""dax"" correspond to the color ""green"".

3. dax zup dax zup wif => green yellow green yellow red
   Each ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green"".

4. dax bluf => green green
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

5. dax => green
   Alone, ""dax"" still represents the color ""green"".

Based on these observations, we can form the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following rules for the words:

- The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red.""
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow.""
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue.""
- When ""walm"" appears, it repeats the color of the word before it thrice. If the word before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red,"" as seen in the third input-output pair.
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green.""

Hence, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" is consistent and independent of its position or the context in which it appears. Therefore, we can state:

wif -> meaning: red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" irrespective of its position or the surrounding words in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Observing the given examples, we can infer the following:

- Every instance of the word ""bluf"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output.
- The word that comes immediately after ""bluf"" in the input is not represented in the output.
  
Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" indicates the color ""red"" and that it causes the omission of the next word in the sequence when translating to colors.

Rule: bluf -> red, and the word following ""bluf"" is omitted from the output.
From the provided examples, the word ""walm"" influences the output in the following ways:

1. In the first example, ""wif lug dax walm,"" the output is ""red blue green green green."" Before ""walm,"" green is mentioned once, but after ""walm,"" it is mentioned twice more.

2. In the second example, ""zup walm dax lug,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow green blue."" Before ""walm,"" yellow is mentioned twice, but after ""walm,"" it is mentioned once more.

3. In the third example, ""lug walm wif zup wif,"" the output is ""blue blue blue red yellow red."" Before ""walm,"" blue is mentioned once, but after ""walm,"" it is mentioned twice more.

4. In the fourth example, ""dax walm wif dax,"" the output is ""green green green red green."" Before ""walm,"" green is mentioned once, but after ""walm,"" it is mentioned twice more.

5. In the fifth example, ""zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow."" There are no colors after ""walm,"" but yellow is mentioned three times, which could still fit the pattern if we conceive that ""walm"" could duplicate or triplicate the preceding color output.

The pattern suggests that ""walm"" causes the color before it to be repeated twice after it. In cases where ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence, it still seems to influence the color to be repeated, as seen by three repetitions of yellow in the last example. However, it does not seem to affect the color that it precedes, only the color that precedes it.

Rule: walm -> causes the color before it to be repeated twice more in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,44
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Analyzing the provided examples:

1. Input: dax zup lug wif zup
   Output: green yellow blue red yellow
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" here.

2. Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
   Output: blue red blue green green
   - Both instances of ""lug"" correspond to ""blue"".

3. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   - ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue"" here.

4. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue"" which is consistent with the previous example.

5. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""lug zup"" corresponds to ""blue yellow"" here.

From these examples, it can be noted that ""lug"" on its own corresponds to ""blue"". When ""lug"" is paired with ""walm"", it repeats the color ""blue"" three times. However, it doesn't change the color when paired with other words such as ""zup"". So, it seems that ""lug"" has a specific interaction with the word ""walm"" that triggers a repeating effect.

Rule: lug -> blue. Additionally, when ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"", it causes the word ""blue"" to be repeated three times.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to a specific color regardless of its position in the sequence.

Here is how ""dax"" corresponds with the examples:

- In the first input, ""dax"" on its own results in ""green.""
- In the second input, ""dax"" is accompanied by ""wif"" and ""zup"" and outputs ""red green yellow,"" where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- In the third input, ""lug bluf dax bluf"" outputs ""blue blue green green,"" here ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" again.
- In the fourth input, ""dax"" appears twice and each time it corresponds to ""green,"" with the sequence outputting ""green yellow green yellow.""
- Finally, in the fifth input, ""lug dax wif"" results in ""blue green red,"" with ""dax"" corresponding to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red'.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the examples provided, whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Rule: bluf -> red
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to represent a repetition of the color associated with the previous word. 

For instance:

- ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue,"" so ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug,"" which is blue.
- ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue red blue red red red blue,"" where ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif,"" which is red three times.
- ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" translates to ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue,"" with ""walm"" repeating the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow twice.
- ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" translates to ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow,"" with both instances of ""walm"" repeating the color red for ""wif.""
- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" with ""walm"" repeating the color green for ""dax.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word the same number of times as there are letters in the previous word. For instance, if the preceding word is three letters long, ""walm"" would mean repeating that color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning: blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue"". The position of ""lug"" within the input sequence does not affect its associated output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" 

Therefore the rule is: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" The position of ""zup"" in the input does not alter its associated output. Therefore, whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output.
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color corresponding to the word before bluf. 

Let's examine the examples to deduce this rule:

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
- Here, 'wif' is followed by 'bluf'. 'wif' corresponds to the color red, and since the word 'bluf' follows it, the output for 'bluf' is the same color repeated, which is red.

Input: dax bluf wif
Output: green green red
- 'dax' is followed by 'bluf' and corresponds to green. Therefore, the output for 'bluf' is the color following 'dax', repeated, which is green. The word following 'bluf' is 'wif', which corresponds to red.

Input: lug bluf wif
Output: blue blue red
- 'lug' is followed by 'bluf' and corresponds to blue. As with the previous examples, 'bluf' causes a repetition of the blue color, followed by the color corresponding to 'wif', which is red.

Input: dax lug bluf wif
Output: green blue blue red
- 'lug' is followed by 'bluf' and corresponds to blue. Even though 'dax' appears before 'lug', 'bluf' only causes a repetition of the color immediately before it, which in this case is blue, followed by 'wif' corresponding to red.

Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow
- 'wif' comes before 'bluf', and it corresponds to red. The rule implies that the 'bluf' repeats the color before it, hence red is repeated. 'lug' corresponds to blue and 'zup' to yellow.

Thus, the rule for 'bluf' is that it repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the presence of the nonce word ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. The color is repeated for every instance the word ""walm"" occurs. For instance, in the first example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the color blue (which corresponds to ""lug"") is repeated three times after the word ""lug"" because ""walm"" is repeated three times as well. Here's the breakdown:

- Example 1: ""lug walm walm wif dax"" translates to ""blue blue blue red green"", where ""blue"" is repeated due to ""walm"" occurring three times.
- Example 2: ""lug walm zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue yellow red"", where ""blue"" is repeated once because ""walm"" occurs once after ""lug"".
- Example 3: ""lug zup dax walm"" translates to ""blue yellow green green green"", where ""green"" is repeated due to ""walm"" occurring after ""dax"".
- Example 4: ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"", where ""red"" is repeated due to ""walm"" occurring after ""wif"".
- Example 5: ""wif lug walm"" translates to ""red blue blue blue"", where ""blue"" is repeated due to ""walm"" occurring after ""lug"".

Given this pattern, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the word immediately preceding ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,46
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"".
Analyzing the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can attempt to deduce what ""dax"" means within the context of these examples. To do this, we must look for patterns in the positions of the word ""dax"" and the associated colors in the outputs.

Examples with analysis:

1. wif walm dax zup
   red red red green yellow
2. dax wif zup dax
   green red yellow green
3. wif dax zup walm
   red green yellow yellow yellow
4. dax
   green
5. dax wif walm lug zup
   green red red red blue yellow

From these examples, we can observe the following:
- In Example 1, ""dax"" is the third word, and the corresponding color in the output is ""green.""
- In Example 2, ""dax"" appears as the first and last word. In both positions, it corresponds to the color ""green.""
- In Example 3, ""dax"" is the second word, and the color is ""green"" again.
- In Example 4, ""dax"" is the only word, and the output color is ""green.""
- In Example 5, ""dax"" is the first word followed by a sequence of colors starting with ""green.""

A common pattern that we can infer is that whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the corresponding output color is ""green."" This is irrespective of its position in the input sequence.

Rule:
dax -> green

Meaning:
Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output color is ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" In every example provided, whenever ""wif"" appears, it is consistently translated into ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" could be related to the color that follows the word that ""zup"" is replacing in the sequence. Let's examine the examples:

1. dax bluf wif zup dax -> green green red yellow green
2. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
3. zup wif dax walm -> yellow red green green green
4. zup bluf wif dax wif zup -> yellow yellow red green red yellow
5. lug zup -> blue yellow

From example 1, ""zup"" replaces ""wif"" and the color for ""wif"" is red, but the color that follows ""zup"" in the sequence is yellow, not red. 

In example 2, ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"" and both are yellow, which seems to support the idea that ""zup"" takes the color following it. 

However, in example 3, when ""zup"" is followed by ""wif,"" the output is yellow red, and ""wif"" is usually red based on previous examples, which again does not support the theory. 

In example 4, there are two ""zup"" words: ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" and ""wif zup"" results in ""red yellow."" This shows that ""zup"" translates to yellow and the word after ""zup"" keeps its associated color, which continues to support the earlier notion. 

Finally, example 5 has ""lug zup,"" which results in ""blue yellow,"" so once more, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.

Considering these examples, we can conclude that regardless of the word that comes after ""zup,"" the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. This can be summarized as:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the repetition of the color word that precedes it. Here's the rule deduced from the examples:

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a color word, it repeats that color word.

To illustrate:

- ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" indicates that ""red"" should be repeated.
- ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" means to repeat ""yellow.""
- The example ""dax lug bluf wif"" shows ""green blue blue red,"" which demonstrates that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated before proceeding to the next color, ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning. Rule: When ""bluf"" is used after a color word, it repeats that color word in the output.
To understand what ""walm"" means, let's look for patterns in the examples provided.

In the first input ""zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which suggests ""zup"" and ""walm"" might both correspond to ""yellow.""

In the second input, ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup,"" the ""walm"" is surrounded by other context words. Between two occurrences of ""wif walm zup,"" the output is ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow."" It seems that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" Now observe that after ""walm"" the color string starts repeating from ""red,"" which is the color of ""wif,"" which might imply that ""walm"" causes a repetition but starts from the color that follows it.

In the third input, ""wif zup bluf lug walm,"" the output ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"" again supports that ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" The color ""blue"" repeats three times at the end after ""walm,"" and before ""walm"" we have ""lug"" which is ""blue.""

The fourth input, ""lug zup dax walm,"" gives us ""blue yellow green green green,"" where ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" is a new word that corresponds to ""green."" After ""walm,"" we see ""green"" repeated three times.

Finally, the fifth input, ""zup wif walm,"" outputs ""yellow red red red."" ""Zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" is ""red."" The ""red"" color repeats thrice after ""walm.""

Given these observations, it seems that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color outputted by the word that immediately follows it three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the next color in the sequence to repeat three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow,yellow yellow yellow blue,False,47
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" Here are the examples that demonstrate this:

- ""zup lug wif"" translates to ""yellow blue red,"" with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue.""
- The standalone word ""lug"" translates directly to ""blue.""
- In the example ""zup bluf lug zup walm,"" each occurrence of ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"" with ""lug"" being the third word to have a direct color translation, ""blue.""
- In ""lug wif lug wif lug,"" with ""wif"" translating to ""red,"" ""lug"" consistently stands in for ""blue"" every time it appears.
- The final example ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" has ""lug"" translating to ""blue"" once again.

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green. Rule: The word dax consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present. Each instance of dax in the input is translated to green in the output.
Based on the provided examples, we can induce that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Now let's examine the input and output sequences to establish this rule:

Input: dax lug wif
Output: green blue red
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
Output: green blue yellow red red green
- Same correspondence for ""dax"" and ""lug"" as before,
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,""
- ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red,""
- ""bluf"" likely corresponds to ""red,""
- ""dax"" at the end, consistent with the first instance, corresponds to ""green.""

Input: lug walm wif zup wif
Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue,""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue,""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" but in the second position, it corresponds to ""red.""

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""red.""

Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""red,""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Looking at these examples, ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""zup"" from the given examples, let's compare the inputs with their outputs:

Input: lug zup wif zup
Output: blue yellow red yellow
- Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow
- Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"".

Input: dax zup wif zup
Output: green yellow red yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"".

Input: zup dax lug wif dax
Output: yellow green blue red green
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""dax"" to ""green"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""wif"" to ""red"".

Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax
Output: green green yellow yellow green
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". We can ignore ""bluf"" since it does not correspond to any color in the output, perhaps acting as a filler or null operation in this context.

Based on all examples, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" translates consistently to ""red"". Here is the reasoning:

- Every instance of ""bluf"" in the input is paired with ""red"" in the output.
- ""bluf"" is consistently translated to ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
- Other words in the examples have different translations (""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green""), but ""bluf"" only maps to ""red"".

Therefore, the rule is:

bluf -> red
Examining the given examples, we can attempt to infer the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" and the context in which it is used. The pattern seems to link the appearance of ""walm"" with a repetition of colors. Here are the observations based on the input and output:

1. ""wif walm"" generates ""red red red"". 
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the previously mentioned word three times.
   
2. ""zup walm"" generates ""yellow yellow yellow"".
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and again ""walm"" repeats the color attached to ""zup"" three times.

3. ""dax walm"" generates ""green green green"".
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and we see ""walm"" repeating the color associated with ""dax"" three times.

4. ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" generates ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"".
   - Here ""walm"" repeats the color linked to ""wif"" and later the color linked to ""zup"", further confirming the repetition rule.

5. ""wif dax lug walm"" generates ""red green blue blue blue"".
   - In this example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" generates ""blue"" thrice.

These examples lead us to conclude the rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Causes the color associated with the directly preceding word to be repeated three times.

Hence, if the word preceding ""walm"" correlates to a specific color, ""walm"" will lead to the repetition of that color three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug walm dax
    ",Output: red blue blue blue green,red blue blue blue green,True,48
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" I will analyze the color outputs corresponding to the input sequences that contain ""lug."" Here's a breakdown of these sequences:

1. dax walm zup lug dax
   - Output: green green green yellow blue green
   - The sequence starts and ends with ""dax,"" which both times translates to ""green."" 
   - ""walm"" translates to ""green"" as well, and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
   - ""lug"" is followed by ""dax,"" and its output is ""blue.""

2. zup dax lug
   - Output: yellow green blue
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
   - ""lug"" is the last word, and its output is ""blue.""

3. lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
   - Output: blue red red green blue blue
   - ""lug"" appears first and in the middle of the sequence, both times translating to ""blue.""
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""red,"" and ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

4. wif lug
   - Output: red blue
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""lug"" is the second word, translating to ""blue.""

5. wif bluf lug dax wif
   - Output: red red blue green red
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""bluf"" also translates to ""red,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

Based on these inputs and outputs, ""lug"" consistently translates to the output ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence (beginning, middle, or end). Therefore, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the input. Each occurrence of ""dax"" in the input results in one ""green"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Whenever ""wif"" is mentioned in an input sequence, the output includes ""red"". Additionally, the presence of other words in the input sequence contributes to the output of other colors. For instance, ""dax"" correlates with ""green"", ""walm"" with additional ""red"", ""lug"" with ""blue"", ""zup"" and ""bluf"" with ""yellow"". 

The rule seems to suggest that:

- ""wif"" corresponds to the output of ""red"".
- Each consecutive occurrence of ""wif"" adds another ""red"" to the output series.
- Other words may represent different colors, but within the current data, ""wif"" consistently means ""red"".

Therefore:

wif -> meaning. Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" reliably corresponds to the output ""yellow."" Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" is included in the output. 

However, the presence of other words before ""zup"" seems to add additional colors to the output. For example:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and
- ""wif walm"" corresponds to a repetition of ""red.""

The rule seems to be that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color output, and when multiple nonce words appear before ""zup,"" their corresponding colors precede the color corresponding to ""zup.""

Rule: zup -> yellow

Additional observations that can be made from the examples (although not specifically requested) are:

- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""wif walm"" -> red red red (each word could individually correspond to ""red,"" or the combination could have this specific output)
To deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the set of examples provided.

1. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

2. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red

3. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

4. Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
   Output: green green red yellow blue

5. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red

From these examples, we notice that each repeated output color corresponds to the number of times a particular word appears in the input. The output color appears once for each instance of that word in the input. Analyzing each line:

1. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" also results in ""red.""
2. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" again leads to ""red.""
3. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" leads to ""red,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""green."" However, since ""walm"" did not appear as an output, it suggests that ""bluf"" might modify or have precedence over ""walm.""
4. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""bluf"" leads to ""red,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
5. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" leads to ""red.""

Comparing these results, ""bluf"" consistently leads to the output ""red"" regardless of its position in the input list. However, it's also notable that ""bluf"" never appears together with ""walm"" in the output (see example 3), which could indicate that it appears to override or cancel ""walm.""

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be:

bluf -> red

However, due to example 3, there might be an additional aspect to the rule which prevents ""walm"" from appearing. Since the only such conditions in the examples involve ""walm,"" further examples would be needed to fully understand how ""bluf"" interacts with ""walm."" But with the available information, the simplest rule given is:

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red.""
Based on the examples given, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" represents the instruction to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it three times. Here is the rule induction based on each example:

- In the first example, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" and translates to ""green green green."" Then ""dax"" is mentioned again and translates to ""red,"" followed by ""green"" without repetition. This suggests that ""walm"" caused the tripling of ""green.""
  
- In the second example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which again shows the tripling effect of ""walm.""

- The third example is more complex but supports the tripling rule. ""walm"" follows the list of other words, and after the series of colors, we see ""red red red"" which corresponds to the last word ""wif"" before ""walm."" This suggests ""walm"" is causing the tripling of ""red,"" the color associated with ""wif.""

- The fourth example has ""lug zup walm lug,"" and the corresponding color translation is ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" Here we see ""zup"" followed by ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" being repeated three times.

- In the fifth example, ""zup walm wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow red."" ""Zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" which is then tripled, and ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and it appears once. Again, ""walm"" causes the tripling of the color associated with the word that precedes it.

Rule: walm -> meaning. Meaning is to repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

So, the induction rule for ""walm"" is:
Rule: When ""walm"" is present, it causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax wif
    ",Output: blue green red,blue green red,True,49
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the meaning of ""lug"" by looking at the patterns of input and output. Here's what we see:

1. Whenever ""lug"" is present, the word ""blue"" appears in the output.
2. ""lug"" does not seem to modify or depend on the words around it since those other words correspond to different colors in the output (e.g., ""wif"" -> red, ""dax"" -> green, ""zup"" -> yellow).

Taking these findings into account, it appears that:

lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the output, regardless of the words that come before or after it in the input.
From the given examples, we can deduce the following patterns:

1. When ""dax"" is followed by ""zup,"" the output is green then yellow: ""dax zup"" -> ""green yellow""
2. When ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output is green then blue: ""dax lug"" -> ""green blue""
3. When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is a series of greens equal to the number of ""walm"": ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
4. If additional ""walm"" follow the first instance, they are represented as red: ""dax walm wif walm"" -> ""green green green yellow red red red""

By analyzing the examples, we can establish the following rule:

Rule: ""dax"" signals the start of a sequence and corresponds to the color ""green"". The word immediately following ""dax"" determines the color of the next part of the sequence: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"". Additional instances of ""walm"" after the first are represented by the color ""red"" instead of ""green"". No other rules can be induced for ""wif"" or ""bluf"" as they only correspond to ""yellow"" without more context.

Therefore, we can define the rule for ""dax"" as:

Rule: dax -> signals the start of a color sequence, represented by the color ""green"". Subsequent colors depend on the specific words that follow ""dax"".
Based on the examples provided:

- wif zup bluf -> red yellow yellow
- zup lug zup lug wif -> yellow blue yellow blue red
- wif bluf -> red red
- wif lug dax -> red blue green
- wif lug dax lug -> red blue green blue

The word ""wif"" seems to correlate with the color ""red"" in the output consistently, regardless of the context or position in the sequence. No other word or position in the sequence is associated with the color red in these examples. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red.
From the provided examples, we can induce the following rules:

1. 'zup lug zup lug zup bluf' translates to 'yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow'.
2. 'zup bluf lug zup walm' translates to 'yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow'.
3. 'zup' on its own translates to 'yellow'.
4. 'dax zup walm wif walm' translates to 'green yellow yellow yellow red red red'.
5. 'zup bluf' translates to 'yellow yellow'.

From these examples, the consistent presence of the word 'zup' corresponds to the consistent translation of the word 'yellow'. No matter the sequence or combination with other nonce words ('lug', 'bluf', 'walm', 'wif', 'dax'), the translation of 'zup' remains 'yellow'. Other words seem to consistently correspond to their own colors as well ('bluf' to 'yellow' in the context provided, 'lug' to 'blue', 'walm' to 'yellow', 'wif' to 'red', 'dax' to 'green').

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" correlates with a duplication of the color associated with the previous word. Here's the breakdown of each example:

- In the first example ""wif bluf dax"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and afterwards ""bluf"" results in ""red red,"" so ""bluf"" seems to duplicate the color of ""wif.""
- ""dax walm wif bluf"" translates to ""green green green red red."" Since ""wif"" is red, the ""bluf"" following ""wif"" again yields ""red red.""
- ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" so again ""bluf"" duplicates the color of ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""
- In ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug,"" we see that after each word including ""lug"" (blue), ""dax"" (green), and ""walm"" (yellow), the use of ""bluf"" results in a repetition of the same color.
- The final example, ""wif bluf lug,"" gives us ""red red blue,"" so yet again ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" with a red repetition.

Conclusion:  bluf -> duplicates the color associated with the previous word. Rule:
- When ""bluf"" follows a word, it causes the output to repeat the color that corresponds to the word that precedes ""bluf.""
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" is associated with the repetition of the color that follows the word in the Output. For each instance of ""walm"" in the Input, the following color word is repeated three times in the Output. Here's the observation from the examples:

- Input: ""wif walm"" corresponds with Output: ""red red red""
- Input: ""wif walm lug"" (with other words in between) corresponds with Output: ""red red red blue""
- Input: ""lug walm wif bluf"" shows ""walm"" between two other words and the Output is ""blue blue blue red red""

Therefore, ""walm"" appears to be an instruction to repeat the following color word three times in the Output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the following color word three times in the Output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each unique word corresponds to a unique color:

- Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output.
- The word ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow"".
- The word ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green"".
- The word ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red"".

Therefore, the rule for the word ""lug"" is:

Rule: lug -> blue
From the provided examples, the word ""dax"" seems to have a consistent output associated with it regardless of its position in the sequence. Whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, the output for ""dax"" is always ""green.""

Therefore, based on the examples:

wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
wif dax wif -> red green red
dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red
dax -> green
dax -> green

We notice that ""dax"" corresponds to a single ""green"" every time.

Rule: dax -> green
From the given examples, we can infer the following:

1. When ""wif"" appears after ""zup,"" the output is ""red.""
   - Example: ""zup wif zup dax"" translates to ""yellow red yellow green.""

2. When ""wif"" appears after ""dax,"" the output is ""red.""
   - Example: ""dax wif"" translates to ""green red.""

3. When ""wif"" appears after ""walm,"" the output is ""red.""
   - Example: ""dax walm wif"" translates to ""green green green red.""

4. When ""wif"" appears after ""bluf,"" the output is ""red.""
   - Example: ""dax bluf wif"" translates to ""green green red.""

5. The output ""red"" occurs regardless of the word before ""wif,"" thus the word before ""wif"" does not seem to influence the output for ""wif.""

Based on these observations, a consistent rule is that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" regardless of the context.

Rule: wif -> red.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Explanation: In each example, the occurrence of ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output. It appears to represent the color yellow regardless of its position in the list of input words.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it. 

Here are the patterns we can notice:

- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"". ""Wif"" must represent the color ""red"", and ""bluf"" causes it to be repeated.
- ""zup bluf wif"" results in ""yellow yellow red"". ""Zup"" is then associated with ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated before we see the color for ""wif"".
- ""wif bluf dax"" results in ""red red green"". Here, ""bluf"" causes ""red"" to be repeated before we see the color for ""dax"", which must be ""green"".
- ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"". As before, ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""zup"" which is ""yellow"".
- ""dax bluf lug wif"" results in ""green green blue red"". ""Dax"" is associated with ""green"", which is repeated because of ""bluf"", and ""lug"" must represent ""blue"", followed by ""wif"" for ""red"".

Rule: bluf -> The rule is that ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be that it repeats the color associated with the previous word.

In the examples:

- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"", where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""walm"" repeats this color.
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"", where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""walm"" repeats it.
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"", where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" repeats it.
- ""zup lug walm"" results in ""yellow blue blue blue"", where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug"".
- ""dax walm wif walm zup"" results in ""green green green red red red yellow"", where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""wif"" to ""red"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" repeats the color of the word just before it.

walm -> repeats the color associated with the previously mentioned word. Rule: If X is a color word followed by ""walm"", then the output for ""walm"" is the color corresponding to X repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" appears to correspond to the output ""green."" Each time ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, ""green"" follows in the output. Additionally, the output color does not change despite ""dax"" being followed by different nonce words such as ""walm,"" ""bluf,"" and ""lug,"" which suggests that ""dax"" is not contextually dependent on the word that follows. Therefore, the meaning of ""dax"" is consistently represented by the color ""green"" regardless of accompanying words.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" seems to correspond consistently to the output ""red."" There is no context provided that alters the meaning of ""wif"" or indicates that it is dependent on the words around it. Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, irrespective of its position or the other words present, the output is ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"". When ""zup"" is used alone or regardless of other words in the sequence, it corresponds to ""yellow"". Additional words like ""wif"", ""lug"", ""dax"", and ""walm"" correspond to different colors, but ""zup"" consistently means ""yellow"". 

zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to correspond to the color red when it follows the word ""wif,"" and to the color blue in other contexts. Here's the rule deduced from the examples:

bluf -> red, when immediately preceded by ""wif""
bluf -> blue, in other contexts

Rule:
When ""bluf"" directly follows ""wif,"" it translates to ""red""; in all other cases, ""bluf"" translates to ""blue.""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that walm corresponds to the repetition of the color that the word immediately preceding it maps to. Here's the rule induction based on the inputs and outputs:

- Input: ""wif walm zup"" -> Output: ""red red red yellow""
  (Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", then ""walm"" repeats that color thrice.)

- Input: ""zup dax walm lug wif"" -> Output: ""yellow green green green blue red""
  (Here, ""dax"" maps to ""green"" and then ""walm"" repeats that color thrice.)

- Input: ""lug walm"" -> Output: ""blue blue blue""
  (Here, ""lug"" maps to ""blue"", and then ""walm"" repeats that color.)
  
- Input: ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" -> Output: ""blue blue blue green red blue red""
  (Here, ""lug"" maps to ""blue"" which is repeated thrice by walm, ""dax"" maps to ""green"" and ""wif"" maps to ""red"". Note that ""walm"" only repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately before it.)

- Input: ""zup walm"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
  (Here, ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"", and then ""walm"" repeats that color.)

Based on this pattern, we can deduce the following rule:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the word immediately before ""walm"" three times.
Rule: If X is a word that maps to color Y, and ""walm"" follows X, then the output will be Y repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm wif walm dax lug dax
    ",Output: green green green red red red green blue green,green green green red red red green blue green,True,52
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the provided examples. Each instance of ""lug"" in the input is translated to ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the translation of the nonce word seems to be consistent regardless of its position in the sequence. Here are the word associations observed:

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- bluf -> blue
- lug - red (when followed by another word), blue (when at the end)
- walm - red (when preceded by wif), yellow (when followed by another word)

Looking at the specific uses of ""dax,"" we can see that it consistently translates to ""green."" It maintains this translation whether it is at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of the sequence. This suggests that ""dax"" is independent of its context and translates directly to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red. 

Based on the examples provided, every time the word ""wif"" appears, it is translated as ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color yellow in the outputs provided. Each instance of ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, we can determine a pattern that reveals the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" by comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs. 

Looking at the input-output pairs:

1. ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow""
2. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
3. ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" -> ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red""
4. ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue""
5. ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" -> ""red yellow yellow red green""

From these examples, we can deduce that each word in the input is directly translated to a specific color in the output. It appears that the word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow."" We can confirm this since every time ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears at the same position in the output sequence. 

Additionally, the context does not seem to affect the meaning of ""bluf,"" as its translation to ""yellow"" remains constant, irrelevant of the position or the surrounding words.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

bluf -> ""yellow""
Based on the given examples, the meaning of ""walm"" can be derived by examining the patterns of inputs and their corresponding outputs. Each input word seems to have a color associated with it, which is represented in the output:

- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green

To understand the role of ""walm"" in this color translation, let's examine the output each time ""walm"" is in the input:

1. ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red"". Without ""walm"", the expected output would be ""yellow yellow red"". Therefore, ""walm"" added two extra ""red"".

2. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red"". Without ""walm"", the expected output would be ""blue yellow blue blue yellow red"". Thus, ""walm"" added one extra ""blue"" at the beginning.

3. ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"". Without ""walm"", the expected output would be ""yellow"". Thus, ""walm"" added two extra ""yellow"".

4. ""zup dax lug walm zup"" translates to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow"". Without ""walm"", the expected output would be ""yellow green blue yellow"". Therefore, ""walm"" added two extra ""blue"".

5. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" translates to ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"". Without ""walm"", the expected output would be ""yellow red blue yellow"". Hence, ""walm"" added two extra ""yellow"".

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" duplicates the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it, adding two instances of that color to the output. If ""walm"" is the first word or if there is no preceding color word, it defaults to duplicating ""yellow.""

Rule: walm -> Duplicates the color of the word before it, adding two more instances of that color to the output. If there is no color word before it or if ""walm"" is the first word, it defaults to ""yellow"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax lug

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine each input and corresponding output where ""dax"" appears:

1. wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
2. dax -> green
3. wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> red red yellow red blue green
4. wif bluf dax lug -> red red green blue
5. wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif -> red red green green red red red blue red

Looking closely at these examples, we identify that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"" in the provided outputs.

Based on the available information, here is the deduced rule:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce:

- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green""
- ""lug"" usually translates to ""blue,"" but in the presence of ""wif"" it translates to ""red""
- ""zup"" clearly translates to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" apparently translates to ""blue,"" just like ""lug,"" but without the same interaction with ""wif""
- The word ""wif"" seems to change the color coming right after it to ""red,"" regardless of what the color would otherwise be

Given that the transformation appears consistent when ""wif"" is used, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" changes the next color word to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> changes the following color word to ""red"".
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" 

In every instance where ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Here's the inferred meaning from the provided examples:

- lug zup -> blue yellow
- zup corresponds to the second color which is yellow.

- zup dax walm zup wif -> yellow green green green yellow red
- Both instances of zup correspond to yellow.

- zup bluf wif bluf -> yellow yellow red red
- The first zup corresponds to the first yellow and the second instance of zup is replaced by another yellow.

- dax zup wif -> green yellow red
- zup corresponds to yellow which is between green and red.

- zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
- Here, zup corresponds to the first yellow followed by green twice.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> yellow

Rule: The word ""bluf"" is translated as the color ""yellow"" in the Output for each corresponding Input example.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the patterns preceding and following its occurrence and the respective output patterns.

Looking at the input-output pairs:

- ""dax lug walm"" produces ""green blue blue blue.""
- ""wif walm"" produces ""red red red.""
- ""dax walm"" produces ""green green green.""
- ""lug dax walm wif"" produces ""blue green green green red.""
- ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green.""

From the above examples, we can observe the following:
1. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" repeated three times.
2. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red"" repeated three times.
3. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated four times.
4. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow"" repeated three times, so the same pattern as observed with ""dax,"" ""wif,"" and ""lug.""

The pattern suggests that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that directly precedes it a certain number of times. The number of repetitions seems to be based on the number of letters in the preceding word:
- ""dax"" (3 letters) -> 3 repetitions.
- ""wif"" (3 letters) -> 3 repetitions.
- ""lug"" (3 letters)-> 4 repetitions (It should be 3 repetitions based on the observation, but it's possible that there might be a typo in this example. Assuming no typo, this would be an exception without more context).
- ""zup"" (3 letters) -> 3 repetitions.

Given this, the rule for ""walm"" could be:

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" causes the output of the color associated with the directly preceding word to be repeated a number of times equivalent to the number of letters in the preceding word. If assuming the ""lug"" example is not a typo, then we need more data to understand the exception or another rule governing that specific case.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug
    ",Output: red red,red blue,False,54
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the word ""lug"" seems to correlate with the color ""blue."" Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output. However, it's essential to notice that ""lug"" doesn't influence the order or appearance of other colors tied to other nonce words such as ""wif,"" ""dax,"" or ""zup.""

Here is the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
- In the second example, the absence of ""dax"" eliminates ""green,"" yet ""lug"" still corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the third example, despite the multiple occurrences of ""wif"" and ""zup,"" every time ""lug"" occurs it maps to ""blue.""
- The fourth example also supports this, with ""lug"" mapping to ""blue"" again, and it does not affect the order of other colors associated with ""dax.""
- The fifth example is straightforward: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule can be stated as: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in all provided examples.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" correlates with a specific color output. Here are the examples paired with their respective outputs:

- ""wif lug"" results in ""red blue""
- ""wif zup dax bluf"" results in ""red yellow green green""
- ""dax wif"" results in ""green red""
- ""wif"" on its own results in ""red""
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" results in ""yellow yellow red red red""

From these examples, we can deduce that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Regardless of its position or the presence of other words, whenever ""wif"" appears, ""red"" is included in the output sequence.

Rule: wif -> ""red""
zup -> yellow

Rule: Each instance of ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each other nonce word seems to have its own corresponding color. ""wif"" corresponds with red, ""lug"" with blue, ""dax"" with the first green and ""walm"" with any subsequent greens in the sequence.
bluf -> red when it follows wif, yellow when it follows zup, and blue otherwise.

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the word that precedes it. If ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" means ""red""; if ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" means ""yellow""; if any other word (e.g., ""lug"") precedes ""bluf"" or it is at the beginning of the sequence, then ""bluf"" means ""blue"".
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the patterns associated with its outputs in the given examples. 

- In Input 1, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" which seems to imply that ""walm"" could mean repetition or duplication of the prior color mentioned (here, ""wif"" = red).
- In Input 2, ""dax lug dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue green blue blue blue,"" suggesting ""walm"" might mean doubling the most recent mentioned color (here, ""lug"" = blue).
- In Input 3, ""wif walm zup"" yields ""red red red yellow,"" which supports the rule of duplicating the color prior to ""walm"" since ""wif"" = red and ""zup"" comes after ""walm"" and equals yellow.
- In Input 4, ""zup walm wif"" turns into ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" which also aligns with the duplication rule seeing as ""zup"" = yellow and it is repeated twice after ""walm"" before ""wif"" introduces red.
- In Input 5, ""dax walm zup lug dax"" results in ""green green green yellow blue green,"" where ""dax"" = green is duplicated twice before a new color (""zup"" = yellow) is introduced. 

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color related to the word that immediately precedes ""walm"" two additional times.

Rule: walm -> duplicating the previously mentioned color two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"".
dax -> meaning. Meaning: green

Rule: The word ""dax"" represents the color green.
Based on the examples provided, it seems like the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red"". Regardless of the context provided by surrounding words such as ""lug"", ""walm"", ""zup"", and ""dax,"" which correspond to the colors ""blue,"" ""blue,"" ""yellow,"" and ""green"" respectively, the word ""wif"" remains unchanged in its output. The examples do not provide any variance in the output for ""wif,"" suggesting that it has a single, static meaning.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each instance of the word ""zup"" corresponds directly to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Regardless of its position in the input string, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" is:

zup -> yellow
bluf -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to repeating the color that immediately precedes it.

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a color word, it takes the meaning of that color word, effectively duplicating it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns surrounding its use and the corresponding outputs in the examples provided.

1. ""dax walm"" consistently leads to the output ""green green green,"" which suggests that both ""dax"" and ""walm"" map to the color ""green.""

2. In the input ""dax walm wif walm,"" the output is ""green green green red red red."" Here, the second occurrence of ""walm"" has changed its output to ""red red red,"" implying that the presence of ""wif"" may alter the meaning of ""walm"" that follows it.

3. In ""zup wif dax walm lug,"" the output ""yellow red green green green blue"" correlates with each word transforming into a unique color. The presence of ""wif"" does not directly precede ""walm"" here, and ""walm"" retains its ""green green green"" output, further indicating that ""wif"" preceding ""walm"" changes its output color from green to red.

4. Finally, ""dax wif walm"" corresponds to the output ""green red red red."" The ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" and the ""walm"" that follows ""wif"" is outputting ""red red red.""

Rule: walm -> green when standing alone or directly following ""dax,"" and walm -> red when following ""wif.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Given the examples, it appears that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the word ""green"" in the outputs:

- lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
- dax lug -> green blue
- wif lug dax -> red blue green
- zup wif dax -> yellow red green
- zup walm lug zup wif dax -> yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

All instances where the word ""dax"" appears, ""green"" is the consistent output, regardless of the surrounding words. Thus:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in every example provided.
Based on the given examples:

- When ""zup"" occurs on its own, the output is a single ""yellow.""
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is three ""yellow.""
- When ""zup"" follows ""dax,"" the output directly after ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" which is then followed by the output for ""dax"" and ""walm.""
- When ""zup"" precedes ""lug walm,"" the output is one ""yellow"" followed by an output corresponding to ""lug walm.""

Considering these observations, ""zup"" does not appear to change its output based on the following or preceding words. It consistently translates to ""yellow,"" regardless of context.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns in its usage and output in the examples provided.

- In the first example, ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red."" Knowing that ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""wif"" is ""red"" from the following examples, we can infer that ""bluf"" also means ""red"".

- In the second example, ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" translates to ""green green red yellow blue"". We already know that ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" Since ""bluf"" appears as ""green"" here, this suggests another potential meaning or a different rule coming into play.

- In the third example, ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" translates to ""red green yellow red green green"". Since we have a pattern of ""wif dax"" repeating and translating to ""red green,"" but the last ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" following ""dax,"" it appears that ""bluf"" might be repeating the color of the word before it, unless it precedes ""wif,"" where it translates to ""red"".

- In the fourth example, ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" translates to ""red green red red yellow red."" Here, ""bluf"" immediately follows ""wif"" and translates to ""red,"" which fits our secondary rule from the third example.

- In the fifth example, ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax"" translates to ""red red yellow red blue green."" The pattern holds, as ""bluf"" following ""wif"" turns to ""red.""

Based on the above analysis, it seems that ""bluf"" either replicates the color of the word before it or translates to ""red"" if it follows directly after ""wif.""

Rule: Bluf translates to the color value of the word immediately preceding it unless that word is ""wif,"" in which case ""bluf"" means ""red."" 

Therefore: bluf -> meaning is context-dependent:
- If ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", then bluf means ""red"".
- Otherwise, bluf takes the color value of the word immediately preceding it.
walm -> meaning. Meaning is that the color before ""walm"" is repeated three times.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows a color-coded word (zup for yellow, lug for blue, dax for green), the color corresponding to that word is repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence of words.
Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" appears to translate to the color ""green."" Each instance of the usage of ""dax"" in the input correlates to ""green"" appearing in the output. Other words in the input (like ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""walm"") correspond to different colors in the output.

Here is the breakdown of the examples:

Input: dax wif
Output: green red
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" and ""wif"" correlates with ""red.""

Input: zup dax
Output: yellow green
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"" and ""dax"" correlates with ""green.""

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" ""walm"" correlates to repeating ""blue,"" and ""dax"" correlates with ""green.""

Input: lug dax walm wif
Output: blue green green green red
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" ""walm"" correlates with repeating the previous color (in this case, ""green""), and ""wif"" correlates with ""red.""

Input: dax lug wif
Output: green blue red
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and ""wif"" correlates with ""red.""

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the patterns:

- In the first example, ""zup wif"" leads to ""yellow red."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- In the second example, ""dax bluf lug wif"" results in ""green green blue red."" Again, ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- In the third example, ""wif lug wif"" translates to ""red blue red,"" where both instances of ""wif"" correspond to red.
- In the fourth example, ""zup lug wif"" gives ""yellow blue red,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- In the fifth example, ""wif walm"" yields ""red red red,"" which shows that ""wif"" translates to red even when it's followed by another term like ""walm.""

Based on the examples, it seems clear that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the sentence.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Here is the correspondence shown in each example:

1. ""dax bluf lug wif"" -> ""green green blue red"":
   - 'bluf' corresponds to 'blue'.

2. ""lug bluf wif"" -> ""blue blue red"":
   - 'bluf' again corresponds to 'blue'.

3. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"":
   - 'bluf' again corresponds to 'blue'.

4. ""zup dax bluf zup dax"" -> ""yellow green green yellow green"":
   - 'bluf' is surrounded by 'zup' and 'dax', which correspond to 'yellow' and 'green' respectively. In the output, 'bluf' corresponds to 'green', directly following 'green' which is represented by 'dax'.

5. ""zup bluf dax"" -> ""yellow yellow green"":
   - 'bluf' is surrounded by 'zup' (yellow) and followed by 'dax' (green). 'bluf' here corresponds to a second 'yellow', which might suggest some positional influence, as 'bluf' is not 'blue' in this context.

However, in examples 4 and 5, 'bluf' does not correspond directly to 'blue'. In the fourth example, it appears to correspond to 'green' and in the fifth example to 'yellow'. This suggest that 'bluf' might take the color of the word immediately to its left, when such a word exists.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
If 'bluf' is preceded by another color word, it takes on the color of that word. If 'bluf' is not preceded by a color word, it corresponds to the color 'blue'.

Rule: bluf -> blue, unless preceded by another color word, in which case bluf takes on the color of the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" causes repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. To break down each example:

1. ""zup walm lug wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red""
   Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times before continuing with ""lug"" which is ""blue,"" followed by ""wif"" which is ""red.""

2. ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green green green red""
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated three times before the sequence ends with ""wif"" which is ""red.""

3. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times.

4. ""zup walm lug"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue""
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""yellow"" is repeated three times after ""walm,"" before proceeding to ""lug"" which is ""blue.""

5. ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red""
   Here, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" followed by ""wif"" which is ""red."" After ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated three times, meaning that ""walm"" caused the repetition of ""red,"" the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

From these examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times.

Therefore:

walm -> causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated three times.

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
To figure out the meaning or the rule behind ""zup"", let's look at where it appears and what the corresponding outputs are:

Examples:
1. Input: ""dax zup wif"" -> Output: ""green yellow red""
2. Input: ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" -> Output: ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue""
3. Input: ""dax zup lug wif lug"" -> Output: ""green yellow blue red blue""
4. Input: ""zup lug dax"" -> Output: ""yellow blue green""
5. Input: ""zup lug"" -> Output: ""yellow blue""

Looking at the examples provided:

- Whenever ""dax"" is mentioned, the output is ""green.""
- ""wif"" corresponds with ""red.""
- ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue.""

In examples 2 through 5, where ""zup"" is present, the word that follows immediately after ""zup"" (or in this case, the corresponding color of that word in the output) is ""yellow."" Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: When ""zup"" precedes a word, it translates to ""yellow"" in the output sequence before transitioning to the color associated with the following word.

zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, we can infer that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that the word preceding ""bluf"" represents. Let's verify this with the given examples:

1. zup bluf wif lug dax
   Output: yellow yellow red blue green
   - Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, and the output for ""bluf"" is also yellow.

2. lug bluf dax bluf
   Output: blue blue green green
   - In the first case, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, resulting in ""bluf"" being blue. In the second case, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, resulting in ""bluf"" also being green.

3. lug wif bluf lug wif
   Output: blue red red blue red
   - Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, so ""bluf"" also takes the color red.

4. wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
   - ""Bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, so ""bluf"" is green.

5. zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
   - ""Bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, so ""bluf"" is red.

Rule: bluf -> The color corresponding to the word that precedes ""bluf"".
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to induce the rule that defines what 'walm' stands for:

1. Every time 'walm' occurs, the output consists of multiple instances of the word 'red.' This suggests that 'walm' might correlate to 'red.'

2. However, we must note the number of times 'red' appears in the output and compare it to the position of 'walm' in the input:

   - When 'walm' is in the second position, there is one 'blue' and three 'reds':
     ""lug walm wif"" -> ""blue blue blue red""
  
   - When 'walm' is in the third position, there are three reds:
     ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red""
  
   - When 'walm' is in the third position again, there are three blues followed by a 'red':
     ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""

   - When 'walm' appears twice in the fourth and eighth positions, the pattern around 'walm' is two yellows followed by 'red':
     ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" -> ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""

   - When 'walm' is in the fifth position, there is one 'red' followed by three 'reds':
     ""lug wif zup wif walm"" -> ""blue red yellow red red red""

Based on these observations, the position of 'walm' doesn't seem to straightforwardly affect the number of 'reds.' So, we need a different aspect to deduce the meaning of 'walm.'

Let's observe other words that co-occur with 'walm':

- 'lug' always results in 'blue.'
- 'wif' always results in 'red.'
- 'zup' results in 'yellow,' except when it follows 'lug zup,' it results in a yellow followed by a different color unless 'walm' comes after 'zup', which then resorts back to yellow.

Now focusing on 'walm' effects:
- 'walm' seems to reset the pattern that otherwise follows the previous word ""zup"".

It seems the best rule isn't about the word 'walm' in isolation but rather its ability to influence or reset the output pattern depending on other factors. The reset itself is not completely consistent, which indicates that other rules or context might be needed to fully define 'walm.'

Hence, the data does not cleanly fit into a concrete rule based only on the given examples. Nevertheless, given the context and the examples, one could propose a cautious rule that:

Rule: 'walm' might represent a reset or override of the following color pattern based on previous words, often resulting in multiple instances of 'red' but could depend on its position or the context created by previous words. However, this rule is speculative and would require further examples to definitively confirm or refine.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm dax
    ",Output: blue blue blue green,blue blue blue green,True,59
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in every example given.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the repeated and consistent association of 'dax' with the output 'green,' it is reasonable to conclude that in this context, 'dax' signifies the color green. The presence of 'dax' in the input consistently results in 'green' as part of the output.
Based on the examples provided:

- ""dax lug wif"" corresponds to ""green blue red""
- ""wif walm dax zup"" corresponds to ""red red red green yellow""
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red red red""
- ""wif"" on its own corresponds to ""red""
- ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" corresponds to ""red blue blue red yellow""

In every instance where the word ""wif"" appears, it translates to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"". Let's analyze the input-output pairs to identify patterns.

1. ""lug zup lug"" matches with ""blue yellow blue"". Here, ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow"" and we assume ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue"".

2. ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" matches with ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"". From this, it's evident that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""lug"" remains consistent with ""blue"", and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". ""walm"" does not have a consistent single-color matching but seems to produce ""red yellow"".

3. ""zup wif"" matches with ""yellow red"". This is consistent with ""zup"" as ""yellow"" and ""wif"" as ""red"".

4. ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" matches with ""yellow red green red red"". From this sequence, we confirm ""zup"" as ""yellow"", ""wif"" as ""red"", and we infer ""dax"" as ""green"". ""bluf"" does not have a direct color attributed but seems to relate to the color before it, producing an additional ""red"".

5. ""zup bluf"" matches with ""yellow yellow"". Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" likely causes a repetition of the color prior to it, which is ""yellow"".

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule for ""zup"":

Rule: zup -> yellow

The rules for the other words seem to be:
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- bluf -> repeat the previous color
- walm -> inconsistent pattern, but appears to be related to reproducing ""red yellow"" sequence; needs more examples to clarify.
From the provided examples, we can try to identify patterns that will help in figuring out the meaning or rule governing the use of the nonce word ""bluf."" Let's analyze the examples and see if there is a pattern associated with the occurrence of ""bluf"":

1. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
2. wif bluf dax -> red red green
3. zup lug bluf -> yellow blue blue
4. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
5. dax bluf wif lug zup -> green green red blue yellow

Considering ""bluf"" appears in the second position of the translated examples 1, 2, and 4 resulting in the repetition of the word preceding it, one could initially hypothesize that ""bluf"" causes the preceding word to repeat its associated color.

However, in example 3, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" suggesting “bluf” maintains the color of ""lug"" regardless of their position—the same happens in example 1 with “zup bluf.” Meanwhile, in example 5, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" and the output does not repeat ""green"" (from ""dax"") but presents ""green red,"" which correlates to the colors of ""dax"" and ""wif"" respectively.

From this information, ""bluf"" seems to indicate that the color associated with the word just before ""bluf"" should repeat, except when ""bluf"" is followed by another word, in which case the sequence continues normally.

Rule: bluf -> ""repeat the color of the preceding word unless followed by another word, in which case the output continues with the associated color of each word.""
Analyzing the inputs and the given outputs, it seems the word ""walm"" affects the color words that come after it in a certain way. I will consider each example to understand the rule.

1. ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" The ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which becomes ""blue,"" and it repeats the ""blue"" three times.

2. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" becomes ""green green green yellow blue blue blue."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which becomes ""green,"" and repeats ""green"" three times. Furthermore, another ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which turns to ""blue,"" and it repeats the ""blue"" three times.

3. ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue."" The ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" and repeats ""blue"" three times.

4. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red green green green blue."" Again, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and repeats ""green"" three times here.

5. ""dax walm wif"" becomes ""green green green red."" ""Walm"" follows ""dax,"" which becomes ""green,"" and it repeats ""green"" three times again.

Basing the rule on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color that corresponds to the word before it to repeat three times. Therefore, if the word before ""walm"" translates to ""blue,"" ""walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue.""

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the previous color word's corresponding color three times. If the word before ""walm"" is translated to ""green,"" then ""walm"" means ""green green green""; if the word before ""walm"" translates to ""blue,"" ""walm"" means ""blue blue blue""; and so on.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The term ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in every instance provided. The colors for the other nonce words can be inferred as follows: 
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- bluf -> green
- zup -> yellow
According to the given input-output pairs, we can try to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax."" Here are the examples formatted in a more useful way for analysis:

1. ""dax wif"" -> ""green red""
2. ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" -> ""blue green green yellow blue red""
3. ""dax wif"" -> ""green red"" (same as example 1)
4. ""dax"" -> ""green""
5. ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow""

Analyzing the examples, ""dax"" appears in each input where the output is ""green."" The first and third examples are identical, each translating to ""green red"" which further emphasizes the rule. Even when ""dax"" appears with other nonce words, it consistently maps to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, we can infer that each nonce word corresponds to a color:

- wif corresponds to red,
- dax corresponds to green,
- lug corresponds to blue,
- zup corresponds to yellow,
- bluf corresponds to red.

Hence, each time we see the word ""wif"" in the input, the output is ""red"". Therefore, we can conclude:

Rule: ""wif"" -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the outputs provided. Regardless of its position in the sequence or the context of surrounding words, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"".
Based on the given examples, we can infer the following pattern:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf lug zup"" translates to ""red red blue yellow."" Since ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" by process of elimination, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" becomes ""yellow yellow red green red yellow,"" which, given the known translations from the previous example, again suggests that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
- The third example, ""lug wif bluf,"" is translated as ""blue red red"" which is consistent with our previous finding.
- The fourth example, ""zup dax bluf,"" is ""yellow green green."" Here, ""bluf"" must correspond to ""green,"" which doesn't align with the earlier pattern. However, it’s possible that this discrepancy is the result of ""dax"" meaning ""green"" and it having a duplicating effect on the following word.
- The fifth example, ""zup bluf wif,"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red."" It is consistent with the initial assumption that ""bluf"" means ""red"".

Since there's an inconsistency in the fourth example that could potentially be explained by an unknown rule regarding ""dax,"" and all other examples consistently show ""bluf"" yielding ""red,"" the best rule we can induce is that ""bluf"" likely means ""red,"" with a possible interaction effect from ""dax.""

Rule: bluf -> red
Based on examining the examples provided, there seems to be a pattern related to the use of ""walm"" and the color repetition in the output:

1. When ""dax walm"" is input, the output is ""green green green,"" which represents three greens.
2. When ""wif walm dax zup"" is input, the color output sequence adds a ""red"" for ""wif,"" and ""yellow"" for ""zup,"" while ""dax"" keeps its designated color ""green,"" and ""walm"" precedes the threefold repetition of the color associated with the word that follows it (""dax"" in this case, so three greens).
3. When ""zup walm dax"" is input, the sequence starts with ""yellow"" for ""zup,"" then ""walm"" causes the three repetitions of ""green"" for ""dax.""
4. When ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" is input, ""lug"" and ""bluf"" have corresponding colors ""blue,"" ""wif"" has the color ""red,"" and ""walm"" precedes the three repetitions of ""red"" for ""wif.""
5. The repetition of ""dax walm"" with the same output ""green green green"" confirms the consistency of the correlation between ""dax"" and ""green.""

Given the pattern in the examples, the rule appears to be:

- The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word that follows it to be repeated three times.

Thus, the rule can be summarized as:

Rule: walm -> triggers a triplet repetition of the color associated with the following word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the given context.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word translates to a specific color. Here's the correlation between the input words and their respective outputs:

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> blue

Notice that the word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore:

dax -> green

Rule: Each nonce word maps to a specific color, and the word ""dax"" maps to the color green.
Based on the examples provided:

- Every instance of ""dax"" is followed by ""green.""
- ""walm"" after ""dax"" continues to produce ""green.""
- ""lug"" by itself generates ""blue.""
- ""wif"" by itself or preceding other words results in ""red.""
- ""bluf"" following ""wif"" brings two ""red"" outputs, then the pattern for ""dax walm"" follows.
- ""zup"" by itself appears to result in ""yellow.""

The consistent rule appears to be that ""wif"" correlates with the output of ""red."" Therefore, the induced rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, each word in the input seems to correspond to a specific color in the output. Here's the breakdown:

- ""bluf"" results in ""yellow""
- ""dax"" results in ""green""
- ""walm"" results in ""red""
- ""wif"" results in ""red""
- ""lug"" results in ""blue""

Additionally, ""zup"" consistently results in ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the list of words. Therefore, we can deduce:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Rule: bluf means blue when it precedes or follows ""lug,"" but when it precedes or follows ""wif"" or ""zup,"" it changes to the color that ""wif"" or ""zup"" represents (red or yellow, respectively). 

Thus, the underlying rule seems to be that bluf reflects the color of the word it is associated with, unless it is with ""lug,"" in which case it remains blue. 

bluf -> meaning: bluf means ""blue"" when next to ""lug,"" otherwise it takes the color of the adjacent word.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to analyze the common patterns associated with its usage in the given examples. Let's examine each case:

1. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green
   
   When ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" the color green is repeated.

2. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   
   When ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" the color red is repeated.

3. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   
   Here, ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" and the color blue is repeated until another color is introduced by the following words dax -> green, wif -> red.

4. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   
   Again, ""walm"" after ""wif"" leads to the repetition of red.

5. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   
   Here, ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" leading to the repetition of green.

Drawing from these observations, it seems that ""walm"" causes the following rule:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears after a word, the color associated with that word is repeated multiple times. The number of repetitions seems to be independent of a fixed count and may continue until interrupted by a different word-color association.

So, the rule induction for ""walm"" might be:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the previous word until a new word with its associated color appears.

Example application of the rule:

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output interpretation based on rule:
wif -> red
walm -> repeat red
dax -> provides next color, green
zup -> provides next color, yellow

Actual output: red red red green yellow
This matches the pattern we deduced.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,62
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the input-output pairs provided, the rule that can be deduced is as follows:

lug -> meaning. Meaning: blue.

Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"" in each given output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Given the examples, we can analyze the occurrence of ""dax"" and its corresponding output to figure out what ""dax"" means in terms of output color:

1. Input: dax zup Output: green yellow
2. Input: wif bluf dax Output: red red green
3. Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif Output: blue green green yellow blue red
4. Input: lug dax walm wif Output: blue green green green red
5. Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax Output: green green yellow yellow green

The term ""dax"" always corresponds to the color green regardless of its position within the input string, implying that ""dax"" consistently maps to the color green.

Rule: dax -> green.
Given the provided examples, let's analyze them to deduce the rule for the term ""wif"":

- Example 1: ""dax lug walm zup wif"" results in ""green blue blue blue yellow red"". 
- Example 2: ""lug wif walm"" results in ""blue red red red"".
- Example 3: ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"".
- Example 4: ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" results in ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red"".
- Example 5: The input ""wif bluf"" is the same as in Example 3, which confirms the output ""red red"".

In each occurrence, ""wif"" correlates with the color red. There seems to be no variation in color or rule associated with surrounding words. When ""wif"" appears, the output is always red. Thus, we can conclude:

wif -> meaning. Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color red.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""zup"" is a rule that affects the preceding word or color. Observing the outputs, it looks like ""zup"" causes the preceding color to repeat. Let's validate this hypothesis with the given examples:

1. lug wif dax zup walm -> blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   - Here, ""dax"" which is ""green"" is followed by ""zup"" and then we have two additional ""yellow"" which corresponds to the color ""green"" repeating.

2. dax zup dax zup wif -> green yellow green yellow red
   - Once again ""dax"" (green) is followed by ""zup"" and then ""green"" is repeated as ""yellow"".

3. lug dax zup lug wif -> blue green yellow blue red
   - Here ""dax"" (green) is followed by ""zup"" and then ""green"" is translated to ""yellow"".

4. lug walm zup lug walm -> blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   - ""walm"" doesn't appear directly before ""zup"" in this sequence, so it doesn't follow the pattern we're looking for. However, it appears that ""lug"" (blue) translates to a repeated ""blue"" output but it isn't directly adjacent to a ""zup"" in the input.

5. lug zup -> blue yellow
   - ""lug"" (blue) is followed by ""zup"" and blue is translated into ""yellow"" when ""zup"" appears.

The hypothesis of ""zup"" causing the preceding color to repeat seems inconsistent with example 4. It could be that ""zup"" actually causes the next mentioned color to be ""yellow"", indicating that it changes the preceding word to ""yellow"" regardless of what the initial color was. Examples 1, 2, and 3 support this as well. 

This interpretation is somewhat supported by example 5 where ""lug"" followed by ""zup"" results in ""blue yellow,"" but example 4 introduces ambiguity as it doesn't quite align with this rule since the output is ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue,"" and ""zup"" is followed by ""lug"" instead.

Nonetheless, if we're required to provide a rule solely based on the examples excluding example 4, which might be an outlier or contain a data error, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""zup"" changes the preceding word to ""yellow"" in the output sequence. This can be denoted as:

zup -> changes the preceding color to ""yellow""
Given the examples provided, ""bluf"" appears to always correspond to the output ""red."" Notably, ""bluf"" seems to generate one ""red"" in the sequence on its own. The other words in the inputs also correlate to specific colors. Each instance of ""wif"" results in an additional ""red"" in the sequence, ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" correlates with ""green."" ""lug"" also appears once in the examples, paired with ""blue.""

Here are the identifications based on the examples:
- ""wif"" generates ""red""
- ""zup"" generates ""yellow""
- ""dax"" generates ""green""
- ""lug"" generates ""blue""

Thus, we can deduce:

bluf -> ""red""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it, extending for the number of syllables in that word. Here's how the rule applies to the examples:

1. ""lug dax walm"" -> ""blue green green green""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and because ""dax"" has one syllable, ""walm"" leads to ""green"" being repeated three more times.

2. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" -> ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and because ""zup"" has one syllable, ""walm"" leads to ""yellow"" being repeated three more times.

3. ""wif walm lug bluf"" -> ""red red red blue blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and because ""wif"" has one syllable, ""walm"" leads to ""red"" being repeated three times, before moving to ""bluf"" which generates ""blue blue"" due to it having two syllables.

4. ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and because ""wif"" has one syllable, ""walm"" leads to ""red"" being repeated three times. Then, it moves to ""dax"" which is ""green"" and ""zup"" which is ""yellow"".

5. ""dax zup dax walm"" -> ""green yellow green green green""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and because ""dax"" has one syllable, ""walm"" after the second ""dax"" leads to ""green"" being repeated three more times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word an additional number of times equal to the number of syllables in that word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Rules:
Analyzing the examples:

1. lug zup → blue yellow
2. zup lug walm → yellow blue blue blue
3. wif dax lug walm → red green blue blue blue
4. lug wif lug bluf → blue red blue blue
5. lug zup walm lug → blue yellow yellow yellow blue

The word ""lug"" precedes different words in the input but consistently translates to ""blue"" in the output. ""Walm"" seems to add repetitions of the color ""blue"", as in the second example, ""zup lug walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue"" where ""lug"" becomes ""blue"" and ""walm"" adds two more ""blue"" to the output.

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> meaning. Rule: dax translates to the color ""green"". Whenever dax appears in the input, the output is ""green"".
Given the examples, it appears that ""wif"" causes the output of colors to repeat the pattern of colors that corresponds to the word following ""wif.""

Let's examine the patterns:

1. ""dax zup walm wif walm"" results in ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red."" The pattern of one green, two yellows, is repeated once before ""wif,"" followed by three repetitions of red, which corresponds to ""walm.""

2. ""lug walm wif bluf"" results in ""blue blue blue red red."" ""Lug"" corresponds to three repetitions of blue. Following ""wif,"" we see ""bluf"" translated into two reds.

3. ""wif zup wif dax"" results in ""red yellow red green."" Here, ""wif"" starts with red and is followed by ""zup,"" which translates to yellow. Again, ""wif"" leads to red, and ""dax"" translates to green.

4. ""wif dax zup dax"" results in ""red green yellow green."" The pattern begins with ""wif,"" which is red. Each word following ""wif"" is translated as expected: ""dax"" to green, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""dax"" again to green.

5. ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red."" Here, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" which translates to three reds.

Based on this analysis, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be to repeat the color pattern of the next word in the sequence an extra time for each appearance of ""wif.""

Rule:
wif -> causes the color representation of the subsequent word to be repeated.
Considering the examples provided, it appears that each word translates to a specific color. To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we should look for the consistent output color whenever ""zup"" appears in the input.

Here are the mentions of ""zup"" and their corresponding color output:

- dax walm wif zup -> green green green red yellow
- wif zup -> red yellow
- wif zup dax -> red yellow green
- zup dax lug -> yellow green blue
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow

Every time ""zup"" is mentioned, ""yellow"" is in the corresponding output:

- dax walm wif zup -> green green green red yellow (yellow is the last color)
- wif zup -> red yellow (yellow comes immediately after ""wif"")
- wif zup dax -> red yellow green (yellow comes right after ""wif"" again)
- zup dax lug -> yellow green blue (yellow is the first color)
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow (yellow comes immediately after ""zup"")

zup -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red"" when it is positioned after ""wif,"" and it translates to the color ""blue"" when it follows other words such as ""zup,"" ""lug,"" or ""dax."" Let's look to further affirm this induction:

- In the first input, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""lug,"" and the corresponding output colors are ""yellow blue blue,"" suggesting a transition from yellow to blue starts with the term ""bluf.""
- In the second input, ""bluf"" is following ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red,"" confirming that ""bluf"" in this context leads to the color red.
- In the third input, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue,"" which is consistent with ""bluf"" translating to ""blue"" when it doesn't follow ""wif.""
- The fourth input is similar to the first, and the output supports the previous observations.
- Lastly, in the fifth input, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (outputting a corresponding ""green"") and precedes ""lug,"" resulting in ""green blue."" This reinforces the pattern where ""bluf"" leads to ""blue"" when not following ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" when following ""wif"" and to ""blue"" when following any other word.

So the rule induction for ""bluf"" would be:

bluf -> meaning:
Following ""wif"" -> red
Following any other word -> blue
From the given examples, we can infer the following patterns for the word ""walm"" and the colors associated with the other words:

- When ""zup"" appears before ""walm,"" the output is multiple repetitions of ""yellow.""
- When ""dax"" appears before ""walm,"" the output is multiple repetitions of ""green.""
- The word that appears directly before ""walm"" dictates the color that is repeated.
- The number of repetitions of the color seems to be based on how many times the word before ""walm"" has appeared in the sequence before ""walm.""

Let's verify this pattern with the examples:

1. ""zup walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow"" suggesting ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and since ""zup"" appeared once, ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

2. ""dax walm lug"" yields ""green green green blue,"" where ""dax"" is associated with green, it appeared once, so ""green"" is repeated three times, followed by the color for ""lug"" which is ""blue.""

3. ""zup lug walm"" yields ""yellow blue blue blue,"" here ""lug"" is before ""walm"" and has appeared once in the sequence so ""blue"" is repeated three times, and yellow is for ""zup.""

4. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" yields ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""; ""zup"" appears twice before ""walm,"" so ""yellow"" is repeated four times after the second ""zup."" The colors for ""dax,"" ""wif,"" and ""bluf"" appear to be ""green,"" ""red,"" and ""red"" respectively.

5. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" yields ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue""; ""zup"" is the word that comes before ""walm"" and is seen once before walm, so ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

Given this analysis, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word directly before ""walm"" a number of times equal to the total count of the word that comes before ""walm"" plus two times.

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word by the number of occurrences of that word in the sequence prior to ""walm"" plus two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax wif bluf
    ",Output: blue green red red,blue green red red,True,64
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Every instance of the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be related to the repetition of words and their positions. Here are the observations:

1. Every example begins with ""wif,"" and the output always starts with ""red.""
2. When ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is multiple ""red"" based on the number of times ""walm"" follows immediately after ""wif.""
3. The word ""zup"" leads to the output switching colors (from red to yellow to blue to yellow, etc.).
4. The repetition of any other word (like ""bluf"") after ""zup"" doesn't change the color immediately but eventually leads to the color switching back to red when ""wif"" reappears.

Thus, we can induce the following rule:

wif -> initiates a sequence with the color ""red.""

However, to fully understand the meaning of ""wif"" in relation to the entire sequence and how it affects the color changes, we would need more examples or further context.

Rule: wif -> initiates a sequence with the color ""red."" The subsequent colors appear to follow a pattern influenced by the presence and repetition of other words in the input, but more data is needed to fully understand the complete rule set.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""

Here's the rule based on the inputs and outputs:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Observing the patterns in the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" translates to a color, consistent with the color of the word preceding it. To confirm:

- In ""zup lug zup bluf lug"", the color before ""bluf"" is ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"".
- In ""wif bluf"", the color corresponding to ""wif"" is ""red"", and ""bluf"" also translates to ""red"".
- In ""dax bluf zup"", the color for ""dax"" is ""green"", hence ""bluf"" equals ""green"".
- In ""dax zup bluf"", ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which translates to ""yellow"", making ""bluf"" also ""yellow"".
- In ""lug bluf wif"", ""lug"" stands for ""blue"" and so does ""bluf"".

Based on these observations, the rule is:

bluf -> Repeats the color of the word immediately before it.
Analyzing the examples given:

1. wif walm dax -> red red red green
2. zup dax walm zup wif -> yellow green green green yellow red
3. lug walm zup walm -> blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
4. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red
5. lug walm -> blue blue blue

From the sequences, it seems that the output colors correspond to the words that precede the word ""walm."" Here's what I have deduced:

- Whenever ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""
- After ""lug,"" the output corresponding to ""walm"" is ""blue blue blue.""
- When it follows ""zup,"" the output changes to the pattern ""yellow yellow yellow,"" but ""yellow"" is also representing ""zup"" (as seen in example 2). It seems that the combination of ""zup"" and ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to ""zup.""

Based on the sequences above, it is reasonable to conclude that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that comes directly before it a certain number of times. Specifically:
- ""wif"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times.
- ""dax"" results in a single ""green.""
- ""lug"" leads to ""blue"" being repeated three times.
- ""zup"" seems to be the base color ""yellow,"" but its repetition depends on the presence of ""walm"" after it.

The word ""walm"" appears to be a modifier that creates repetitions of color patterns based on the preceding word. 

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated a specific number of times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,65
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule is:
lug -> blue
Rule:
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- walm -> repeat the color of the next word

So, the word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the given examples. Each other word correlates with a different color. The word ""walm"" functions as an instruction to repeat the color of the following word rather than a color itself.
wif -> red

Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
Based on the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, it appears that ""zup"" may be a rule that determines the color to be outputted next. Here is how the rule seems to be applied:

In the first example, ""zup"" causes the next word, ""wif,"" to output ""red,"" then ""lug"" to output ""blue,"" followed by ""zup,"" which repeats the color ""yellow"" three times (this repetition might indicate that ""zup"" also means ""yellow"" when it follows a color word), then followed by ""walm,"" which also outputs ""yellow.""

In the second example, ""zup wif"" outputs ""yellow red,"" which suggests ""zup"" may mean ""yellow"" by itself and causes ""wif"" to output ""red.""

The third example shows that when ""wif walm zup"" is the input, it outputs ""red red red yellow,"" which again hints that ""zup"" leads to ""yellow.""

In the fourth example, a sequence of a different word, ""dax,"" enters between ""zup"" and ""walm."" The output suggests that ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green,"" and regardless of its presence, ""zup"" at the end outputs ""yellow.""

The fifth example is similar to the fourth example. Irrespective of the order, ""zup"" outputs ""yellow,"" and the other word sequence dictates their respective color outputs.

From these observations, the rule for ""zup"" seems consistent:
Rule: zup -> yellow

The presence of ""zup"" outputs the color ""yellow,"" and it also appears to influence the following words to output a certain color. However, there seems to be a strong suggestion that ""zup"" on its own or at the end of a sequence means ""yellow.""
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the instances where it is used and the output produced:

1. lug bluf dax lug -> blue blue green blue
2. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
3. wif dax zup bluf -> red green yellow yellow
4. zup bluf dax lug -> yellow yellow green blue
5. dax wif bluf -> green red red

From the second and third examples, we can observe that the word ""bluf"" produces a repetition of the color that comes immediately before it. In the second example, ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow,"" and in the third example, ""zup bluf"" similarly results in ""yellow yellow.""

However, in the first and fourth examples, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""dax lug"" and ""dax lug,"" respectively, but the color blue is not repeated directly after ""bluf."" Instead, it seems that ""bluf"" still causes the repeat of the previous color but is then followed by a sequence where ""dax"" is green and ""lug"" is blue, regardless of the repeated color.

In the fifth example, ""dax wif bluf,"" the word ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which correlates with the color red, and then the output is ""green red red."" This indicates that ""bluf"" also repeats the color of ""wif,"" but since ""dax"" produced green, this presence may be overpowering the repeat effect seen in other examples.

Considering these observations, the most consistent rule for ""bluf"" is that it causes the repetition of the color that comes immediately before it. However, it appears that there are additional rules or interactions that could be impacting the pattern, particularly regarding the presence of ""dax"" and ""lug."" Without more examples specifically isolating the behavior of ""bluf,"" the presence of other words makes it difficult to determine any additional specific interaction rules.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color word immediately preceding it in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, we can see that walm corresponds to repetition in the output. Specifically, the color before walm is repeated three times in the output. Let's examine this pattern in the examples provided:

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - Right before walm is 'wif', which corresponds to 'red'. After walm, 'red' is repeated three times.

2. Input: lug dax walm
   Output: blue green green green
   - Right before walm is 'dax', which corresponds to 'green'. After walm, 'green' is repeated three times.

3. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   - Right before walm is 'wif', which corresponds to 'red'. Immediately after walm, 'red' is repeated three times.

4. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   - Right before walm is 'lug', which corresponds to 'blue'. After walm, 'blue' is repeated three times.

5. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - Right before walm is 'zup', which corresponds to 'yellow'. After walm, 'yellow' is repeated three times.

Given these observations, the rule for walm can be stated as follows:

Rule: walm -> Causes the color corresponding to the word immediately before it to be repeated three times in the output.


    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,66
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples, we can deduce the following correlations:

- Every time the word ""lug"" appears, ""blue"" is in the output.
- ""lug"" seems to be independent of its position within the input string; it always results in ""blue"".
- Other words such as ""wif"", ""zup"", and ""dax"" are paired with different colors, suggesting that they have a different meaning than ""lug"".

Therefore, we can conclude:

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

So, in each provided example, whenever the word ""dax"" appears, it always corresponds to the color ""green"".
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the output. Here are the translations according to the examples:

Example 1: lug dax bluf zup lug wif -> blue green green yellow blue red
Example 2: wif -> red
Example 3: wif dax wif -> red green red
Example 4: zup bluf wif dax wif zup -> yellow yellow red green red yellow
Example 5: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow green red red (Note: 'walm' does not seem to have a corresponding output here, which could be an inconsistency in the examples.)

From these examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples, each word seems to correspond to a specific color:

- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""walm"" seems to also correspond to the color green, given that multiple greens appear in an output when ""walm"" is present.
- ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue.
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- ""lug"" also corresponds to the color blue, as seen in the fourth input producing a sequence with multiple blues.

Consistently, each occurrence of the word ""zup"" in the input results in the color yellow in the output. The outputs show a one-to-one mapping of colors to these nonce words, with yellow only appearing when ""zup"" is in the input and no other phrase influencing its output color. 

Given these observations, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" can be stated as:

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
bluf -> red red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the repeated word ""red red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the inputs and outputs:

1. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow""
2. ""wif lug walm"" results in ""red blue blue blue""
3. ""zup lug walm"" results in ""yellow blue blue blue""
4. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" results in ""yellow blue blue blue red green""
5. ""lug walm wif zup wif"" results in ""blue blue blue red yellow red""

From the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" may not represent a specific single colour but could be related to repetition. The presence of ""walm"" corresponds to repeated colours in the output. The colour to be repeated appears to be determined by the word immediately preceding ""walm"":

1. ""zup walm"" -> ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" which is then repeated three times.
2. When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated four times.
3. Again, ""lug"" before ""walm"" results in four ""blue.""
4. ""lug"" before ""walm"" gives us four ""blue"" once more.

However, we do not get a straightforward number repeat pattern; we need another example or rule to understand why the number of repeated colours changes.

Looking more closely, it seems that each word in the input sequence corresponds to a single colour in the output sequence, except for ""walm."" We can try to match them as follows:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" likely corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" likely corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" likely corresponds to ""green""

Observing the pattern where ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the last colour mentioned but does not seem to have a fixed repetition count, it instead repeats the colour for the rest of the output words. So ""walm"" seems to represent a repeat of the last mentioned colour for all subsequent positions in the sequence.

Based on the evidence:

walm -> meaning. Rule: ""walm"" causes the colour associated with the immediately preceding word to repeat for all subsequent positions in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,67
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Analyzing the provided examples, we can try to deduce the potential meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""lug"":

1. dax lug wif walm -> green blue red red red
2. dax walm lug -> green green green blue
3. lug dax -> blue green
4. dax lug zup dax -> green blue yellow green
5. lug wif lug wif lug -> blue red blue red blue

Let's look for patterns between the inputs and outputs:

- In the first and fourth examples, ""lug"" is preceded by ""dax"" which translates to ""green"" and in both cases, ""lug"" is translated to ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" comes at the end and is translated to ""blue.""
- In the third and fifth examples, ""lug"" is not preceded by ""dax"" and is still translated to ""blue.""

From these examples, it seems that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" and ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue,"" regardless of their position or what they precede or are preceded by. It is also not dependent on the repetition as seen in the fifth example.

Therefore, based on the examples given, the rule seems to be:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. In each of the given examples, each time ""dax"" appears, it is translated to ""green.""
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" is associated with a single color output each time it is used. Here are the consistent associations:

- In the first example, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" and the output is ""red"" followed by ""yellow"" repeated three times, corresponding to ""walm"".
- In the second example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""red"" before the ""red"" that repeats three times for ""walm"".
- In the third example, ""wif"" stands alone and the output is simply ""red"".
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" is preceded by ""dax"" and the output sequence is ""green red"", with ""red"" following ""wif"".
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""lug"" and the output sequence is ""red blue"", with ""red"" aligning with ""wif"".

From this pattern, it can be deduced that ""wif"" is consistently associated with the color ""red"" regardless of its position or what words precede or follow it.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow. 

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
Rule: bluf -> the color word that precedes it. 

Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" repeats the color that comes before it in the input. For instance:
- In ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif,"" ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and ""zup,"" which translates to ""blue"" and ""yellow,"" respectively.
- In ""wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which translates to ""red.""
- In ""zup bluf lug zup,"" ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow.""
- In ""zup bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow.""
- In ""dax bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which translates to ""green.""

Hence, bluf repeats the color specified just before it in the sequence.

To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let’s analyze the examples and their outputs:

1. lug walm -> blue blue blue
2. wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
3. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
4. lug walm zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow red
5. lug walm zup -> blue blue blue yellow

We can notice from the outputs that ""walm"" consistently translates into three repeated words. In the first example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"", and in every instance where ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" it results in three ""blue"" words consecutively. Similarly, when ""walm"" follows other words, there is no repetition of that word's corresponding color.

This pattern allows us to deduce that ""walm"" is an instruction to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times. Hence:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,68
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""lug"" is associated with a color output in each instance. To determine the meaning of ""lug,"" let's analyze the examples and the color patterns:

- Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
- Input: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup -> Output: blue blue red blue blue yellow
- Input: zup walm lug -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
- Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
- Input: wif lug wif -> Output: red blue red

In each example, the word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the output. It thus seems consistent that ""lug"" means ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each nonce word has an associated color. Since every instance of ""dax"" consistently results in ""green,"" we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green

However, there could be more to this pattern considering the multiple words in the final example and their corresponding colors. We might consider that ""bluf"" corresponds to green, ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. However, since we have no additional context or examples for these latter words, we can only confirm the rule for ""dax.""

Rule: dax -> green
By examining the sequences and their corresponding outputs closely, we can identify a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif."" Let's look at each instance:

1. lug wif lug -> blue red blue
2. dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue blue yellow red
3. lug wif walm -> blue red red red
4. zup wif -> yellow red
5. wif dax lug walm -> red green blue blue blue

In examples 1 and 3, the word ""wif"" is preceded and/or followed by the same word (""lug"" and ""walm"" respectively), which leads to the output color being red once followed by the color associated with the word to its right repeated as many times as required. In example 4, ""wif"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow red,"" suggesting that the first mention of ""wif"" changes the subsequent sequence to red again, in the absence of another word to its right.

In example 2, ""wif"" appears at the end and is preceded by ""zup,"" resulting in the ""yellow red"" sequence once more. Finally, in example 5, ""wif"" stands at the beginning and is followed by ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""red green"" in the output, showing a consistency in how ""wif"" influences the subsequent word to become ""red"" and then continues with the natural sequence of colors associated with the next word.

Through these observations, it is apparent that ""wif"" changes the next word's output to red and doesn't seem to affect the color output of words that precede it. When there are no words to follow ""wif,"" as seen in example 2, the color red still appears as the final output, indicating that ""wif"" has a default effect of producing red when it is at the end of a sequence.

Rule: ""wif"" -> meaning: Changes the next word's color output to red. If it stands alone or at the end, it defaults to red.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Evidence:

- ""wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow"", suggesting ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" given that ""wif"" translates to ""red"".
- ""zup wif dax walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red green green green blue"", again ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and the other words translate to their respective colors.
- ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow"" which supports that ""zup"" means ""yellow"" with the information provided so far.
- ""wif walm zup walm"" translates to ""red red red yellow yellow yellow"", indicating that ""zup"" means ""yellow"" because both ""wif"" and ""walm"" are repeated three times each, consistent with their colors ""red"" and ""red"" respectively, and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" each time it appears.
- The final example, ""lug zup"", provides further support for ""zup"" being ""yellow"" because ""lug"" translates to ""blue"". 

Considering all the outputs consistently associate ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" we can deduce the meaning of ""zup"" in these examples.
Based on the given examples, we are trying to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" We will look at the context in which ""bluf"" appears and the corresponding outputs to deduce its meaning.

Example 1: wif zup bluf wif dax -> red yellow yellow red green
Example 2: zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
Example 3: dax bluf wif zup wif -> green green red yellow red
Example 4: dax lug wif bluf -> green blue red red
Example 5: lug bluf wif -> blue blue red

Analyzing the data:

1. In every instance where the word ""bluf"" appears, the output immediately following ""bluf"" is the same as the color output of the word before ""bluf.""
   - Example 1: ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf,"" and both correspond to ""yellow.""
   - Example 2: ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf,"" and both correspond to ""yellow.""
   - Example 3: ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf,"" and both correspond to ""green.""
   - Example 4: ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" and both correspond to ""red.""
   - Example 5: ""lug"" is followed by ""bluf,"" and both correspond to ""blue.""

2. ""Bluf"" does not have a fixed color output associated with it as it changes depending on the word that precedes it.

Based on this analysis, the rule for ""bluf"" can be deduced as:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> The color output of ""bluf"" is the same as the color output of the word immediately preceding it.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to examine the patterns in which it is used across the examples and the corresponding output. The goal is to identify how the word ""walm"" influences the transformation from the input to the output.

Looking at the examples:

1. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

2. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

3. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

4. Input: zup dax walm
   Output: yellow green green green

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

Observations:

- In all examples where ""walm"" is used, the word that immediately precedes ""walm"" is repeated in the output as many times as the single appearance of ""walm"" indicates a single duplication event.
- ""Walm"" causes the previous word's respective color to be duplicated in the output before continuing with regular one-to-one word-to-color translations.

We can generalize the function of ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word that appears immediately before ""walm"" in the input string. The color is repeated three times in total (two additional times beyond the initial mention).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup wif
    ",Output: yellow red,yellow red,True,69
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the Input/Output pairs, we can observe that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"". Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding word in the output is ""blue"", no matter the position or surrounding words.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples given, each input word seems to correspond to a specific color in the output. Consistently, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" Therefore, the rule can be identified as follows:

Rule: dax -> green. 

This rule indicates that whenever the input contains the word ""dax,"" the output should include the word ""green.""
Based on the examples given, it appears that ""wif"" correlates to the word ""red.""

Here's the breakdown:

- When ""dax"" is present, the output is ""green.""
- When ""wif"" is present with ""dax,"" the output is ""red green.""
- When ""wif dax lug walm"" is analyzed, ""lug"" does not appear in any other example, but since ""walm"" correlates to three instances of ""blue,"" ""lug"" can be inferred to also output ""blue."" Therefore, ""wif"" once again corresponds to ""red.""
- In the example ""zup wif walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and since ""walm"" is followed by three ""red"" instead of ""blue,"" it suggests ""wif"" must be changing the output of ""walm"" to ""red."" Thus, ""wif"" here again corresponds to ""red.""
- In the final example, the presence of ""wif"" at the end of the sequence results in a lone ""red"" without any associated input word, pointing to ""wif"" meaning ""red.""

Rule:
wif -> red
Considering the provided examples, we can infer a pattern where each word seems to correlate with a specific color. Let's break down the examples to deduce the meaning of ""zup"":

1. lug zup -> blue yellow
2. dax walm zup lug walm -> green green green yellow blue blue blue
3. zup -> yellow
4. dax zup lug wif lug -> green yellow blue red blue
5. zup -> yellow

From the given examples, ""zup"" always correlates with the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input. We can therefore conclude that ""zup"" specifically means ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" acts as a repeater of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Each time ""bluf"" is used, the color that is mentioned right before it is repeated in the output. 

Here is the observed pattern:

1. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
2. wif bluf zup -> red red yellow
3. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
4. lug bluf -> blue blue
5. wif bluf zup bluf wif -> red red yellow yellow red

In every instance, the word immediately before ""bluf"" has a corresponding color (zup -> yellow, wif -> red, lug -> blue), and the presence of ""bluf"" means that color is mentioned again in the output.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color associated with the previous word.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" has a correspondence with the output ""red red red."" However, in the presence of the word ""zup,"" the output changes to ""yellow yellow yellow."" When both ""wif"" and ""walm"" are present, the combination yields the output ""red red red,"" and when ""dax,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""zup"" precede ""walm,"" they produce ""green,"" ""red red red,"" ""blue,"" and ""yellow yellow yellow"" respectively.

To generalize, it seems that each input word has a corresponding color as its output, and ""walm"" appears to amplify or repeat the color output associated with the immediately preceding word. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the color yellow is repeated three times; when it follows ""wif,"" the color red is repeated three times. However, the repetition rule does not seem to apply when there is a sequence of different input words, as seen in the third example.

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color output associated with the immediately preceding word three times. If ""walm"" is following ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" and if it is following ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red."" If ""walm"" follows different words in a sequence, the output rule becomes less clear, but each word still has a color association.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the given examples, every time the input contains the word ""dax,"" the output consistently includes the color ""green."" Hence, it can be concluded that ""dax"" means ""green.""

Based on the examples provided, each word seems to correlate to a specific color:

- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow

When ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" always appears in the output:

- lug wif -> blue red
- wif dax -> red green
- wif lug zup -> red blue yellow
- dax wif -> green red
- wif -> red

From the given examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the outputs, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to repeating the color that was just translated right before it. Each occurrence of ""bluf"" in the examples directly follows another word, and the output is the second occurrence of the color that was translated from the word right before ""bluf"". To put this into a rule:

bluf -> repeat the color that precedes it

Rule: If a word is translated to a color and is immediately followed by the word ""bluf"", then the output for ""bluf"" is the same color as the preceding word.
Based on the information provided, we can try to deduce what ""walm"" means. We have five different inputs, each corresponding to specific outputs. Each non-walm word seems to correlate with a unique color.

Here's the color translation for the known words:
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red

Now let's analyze the instances of ""walm"" in the examples:

1. In the first input, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and is followed by ""lug"" (blue), translating to two instances of ""yellow"" and then one ""blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" may repeat the color of the previous word and then transition to the next mentioned color.
   
2. In the second input, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) with no other color following, resulting in three instances of ""yellow,"" which aligns with the idea that ""walm"" could be repeating the color of the preceding word.

3. In the third input, ""walm"" is again followed by a series of ""blue"" (lug's color) after a ""yellow"" (zup's color), which repeats the pattern we've seen in example one.

4. In the fourth input, ""walm"" is between ""wif"" (red) and ""lug"" (blue), resulting in three instances of ""red"" followed by one ""blue,"" further supporting the rule identified.

5. In the fifth input, after ""lug"" (blue) we see ""walm"" followed by another ""blue"" and nothing else, continuing the pattern.

Rule: walm repeats the color of the previous word three times if there is no word after it or three times followed by the color of the next word once if there is a word after it.

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the previous word three times, and if followed by another color word, add that color once.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,71
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the given context regardless of its position in the sequence.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples provided, whenever the input contains the word ""dax,"" the corresponding output is ""green."" Thus, ""dax"" signifies the color green in this context.
Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""wif"" by comparing the inputs with their respective outputs.

Input: dax lug wif | Output: green blue red
Input: zup wif zup | Output: yellow red yellow
Input: wif walm dax | Output: red red red green
Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif | Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
Input: zup wif bluf zup lug | Output: yellow red red yellow blue

From these examples, we can observe that every time the word ""wif"" is present in the input, the word ""red"" is present in the output, and it corresponds directly to the position of ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:
Rule: wif -> ""red""
Rule: zup -> yellow

The consistent outcome from every example is that whenever the word ""zup"" is used in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output. No other context or accompanying word changes this output, suggesting that ""zup"" translates directly to ""yellow.""
Given the examples presented, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Let's verify this with the given examples:

- Example 1: ""wif lug zup bluf"" -> ""red blue yellow yellow,"" where ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow.""
- Example 2: ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red,"" where ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red.""
- Example 3: ""dax bluf wif"" -> ""green green red,"" where ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green.""
- Example 4: ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow,"" where ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow.""
- Example 5: ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" -> ""green red green yellow yellow,"" where ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" is that it takes the same color value as the word directly before it in the input sequence.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""bluf"" takes on the color of the immediately preceding word in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""walm"" appears in the input, the output includes the color red. However, the additional colors in the output appear to correspond to other words in the input as well, following some sort of pattern:

- ""wif"" seems to always correspond to the color ""red""
- ""lug"" seems to always correspond to the color ""blue""
- ""zup"" seems to always correspond to the color ""yellow""
- ""dax"" seems to always correspond to the color ""green""

Therefore, one could deduce a rule where each word has a corresponding color, but ""walm"" appears to trigger a repetition of the color assigned to the previously mentioned word. Thus, when ""walm"" follows a word, the output repeats the color associated with the previous word multiple times before it gets to ""walm's"" own color which is red.

To summarize the rule for ""walm"":
""walm"" -> triggers the repetition of the color associated with the previous word, followed by the color ""red.""

This can be observed in the following breakdown:

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red (for ""wif"") red red (repeated for ""walm"", following ""wif"") green (for ""dax"") yellow (for ""zup"")

Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
Output: blue (for ""lug"") blue blue (repeated for ""walm"", following ""lug"") green (for ""dax"") red (for ""wif"") blue (for ""lug"") red (for ""wif"")

The pattern of repetition can vary, but it seems that ""walm"" always precedes a series of reds. Without further context or examples, it is difficult to determine whether the number of repetitions has any specific meaning or if it follows a more complex rule.


    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup dax
    ",Output: blue yellow green,blue yellow green,True,72
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: When the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it translates to ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, it seems that each unique word in the input corresponds to a specified color in the output. The word ""dax"" consistently results in the color ""green"" in various positions within different inputs.

Rule: dax -> green
From the examples provided, we can deduce that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to a particular color each time it is used. Across all examples, ""wif"" always results in the same output:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf lug zup"" corresponds to ""red red blue yellow"".
- In the second example, ""dax walm wif dax"" corresponds to ""green green green red green"".
- In the third example, ""wif lug dax walm"" corresponds to ""red blue green green green"".
- In the fourth example, ""zup wif zup"" corresponds to ""yellow red yellow"".
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

In each case, regardless of position in the sequence or surrounding words, ""wif"" consistently outputs the color ""red"".

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" is:

wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of 'zup', let's look at the inputs and outputs where 'zup' is present:

1. 'zup walm dax lug' -> 'yellow yellow yellow green blue'
2. 'zup wif' -> 'yellow red'
3. 'dax zup bluf' -> 'green yellow yellow'
4. 'zup wif dax walm lug' -> 'yellow red green green green blue'
5. 'zup walm wif' -> 'yellow yellow yellow red'

From these examples, it seems that whenever 'zup' is present, the first color in the output is always 'yellow'. It is independent of the position of 'zup' in the input and the other words present. 'zup' does not seem to influence the color output of the words that follow it.

Based on these observations, the rule for 'zup' seems to be:

Rule: When 'zup' is in the input, the corresponding output is 'yellow'. Therefore,

zup -> yellow.
bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" seems to be ""the color of the word that precedes it.""

Rule: If a word precedes ""bluf,"" the output color for ""bluf"" matches the output color for the preceding word. If ""bluf"" is the first word in the sequence, its default color is ""blue.""
Observing the patterns in the provided examples:

1. When ""wif walm dax zup"" is input, the output is ""red red red green yellow.""
2. When ""zup dax walm lug wif"" is input, the output is ""yellow green green green blue red.""
3. When ""zup wif walm lug"" is input, the output is ""yellow red red red blue.""
4. When ""dax lug walm"" is input, the output is ""green blue blue blue.""
5. Finally, when ""wif walm"" is input, the output is ""red red red.""

Let's examine the position and surrounding context of ""walm"" in each example:

- In all cases, ""walm"" directly follows another word.
- The color ""red"" appears immediately after ""walm"" in every example.

Despite different words preceding ""walm"" across the examples (""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug""), the word following ""walm"" is consistently ""red,"" regardless of the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.

Here's how the rule induction for the nonce word ""walm"" can be synthesized:

Rule: Whenever ""walm"" is used in the input, the color ""red"" immediately follows it in the output.

Thus, the meaning of ""walm"" could likely be a rule that causes the color ""red"" to be output immediately after its occurrence.

walm -> ""red""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif dax walm
    ",Output: blue red green red red,blue red green green green,False,73
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""lug"" by looking at the corresponding output in each instance.

1. ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green""
2. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
3. ""zup wif lug dax"" -> ""yellow red blue green""
4. ""lug"" -> ""blue""
5. ""wif lug dax walm"" -> ""red blue green green green""

In examples 1, 3, and 5, ""lug"" is followed by a color in the output that is not consistent with the colors following other words. ""Walm"" is associated with yellow in the first example, but with green in the fifth, and ""dax"" is associated with green in the first example, and with red in the third.

However, in every instance where ""lug"" appears, it is directly translated to ""blue"" in the output. There is no obvious condition or context affecting this translation, as ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"" regardless of its position or neighboring words.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples given, we can identify a pattern that associates each unique word with a specific color. For each occurrence of a specific word, there is a corresponding color in the output. With this consistency in the examples, we can induce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""dax"" as follows:

dax -> green

Rule:
- wif corresponds to red
- dax corresponds to green
- lug corresponds to blue
- bluf corresponds to blue
- zup corresponds to yellow 

Therefore, each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is correspondingly ""green"".
Based on the examples given, it seems that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. Here are the associations that can be inferred:

- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue""
- ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow""

Now, we use these associations to deduce the meaning of ""wif"" by comparing the input and output sequences:

- In the first example, ""dax wif"" gives ""green red"", which suggests that with ""dax"" accounted for as ""green"", ""wif"" would correspond to ""red"".
- In the second example, ""wif dax lug walm"" outputs ""red green blue blue blue"", and following the established pattern, ""wif"" should be the first color ""red"".
- In the third example, ""wif lug"" leads to ""red blue"", confirming again that ""wif"" is ""red"".
- In the fourth example, we see that the input ""zup dax walm lug wif"" corresponds to ""yellow green green green blue red"". Again, the last ""wif"" corresponds to the final ""red"".
- The fifth example, ""wif dax wif"", outputs ""red green red"", which supports the previous findings where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Rule:
wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"". The presence of the word ""zup"" in the input directly corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the context or the position of ""zup"" within the sequence of words.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule: bluf -> blue

The rule can be determined by observing the consistent placement of the word ""bluf"" in the input and the corresponding output of ""blue"" in the same position. This one-to-one mapping occurs in every example regardless of the position of ""bluf"" in the input string.
Rule: walm -> repetition of the most recent color.

Analyzing the given inputs and outputs:

1. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" Since ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" and repeats ""green"" it suggests that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax.""

2. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   - This input is the same as the first, providing further evidence that ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word.

3. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the color ""yellow"" is repeated. Also, ""walm"" appears again after ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and the color ""red"" is repeated.

4. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   - In this case, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the color ""green"" is repeated. ""walm"" also appears after ""lug,"" corresponding to ""blue,"" resulting in the color ""blue"" being repeated.

5. Input: dax walm zup walm
   Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" leading to another ""green,"" and again after ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and as observed, ""yellow"" is repeated.

Based on these observations, we can deduce that the word ""walm"" is an operation that repeats the color associated with the most recent word before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green."" Each instance of ""dax"" in the inputs corresponds to ""green"" in the outputs, regardless of the context or position of the word in the sentence. Other words such as ""lug,"" ""wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""bluf"" seem to correspond to other colors (""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" does not have a clear translation but may be related to ""red"" given the context of the last example).

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the outputs. Each time ""wif"" is present in an input, the word ""red"" appears in the same position in the output. There is no instance where ""wif"" leads to any color other than ""red.""

Therefore, the rule I have deduced is: wif -> red.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" I will examine the context in which it appears across the examples and its corresponding outputs:

Example 1:
Input: zup
Output: yellow

Example 2:
Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
Output: green green red yellow blue

Example 3:
Input: zup dax
Output: yellow green

Example 4:
Input: zup
Output: yellow

Example 5:
Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

The word ""zup"" consistently results in the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input series. No other words produce ""yellow"" as an output, and ""zup"" does not result in any other output in these examples.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" results in ""red"" when it follows the word ""wif,"" and results in ""green"" when it follows the word ""dax."" If ""bluf"" is preceded by the word ""zup,"" then the output is ""yellow."" There is no example where ""bluf"" is the first word or is preceded by any word other than ""wif,"" ""dax,"" or ""zup.""

From these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it. Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that its output is dependent on the word that comes before it, according to the following pattern:

- If preceded by ""wif,"" ""bluf"" results in ""red.""
- If preceded by ""dax,"" ""bluf"" results in ""green.""
- If preceded by ""zup,"" ""bluf"" results in ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> takes the color output of the preceding word. The color outputs are as follows:
- ""wif"" leads to red.
- ""dax"" leads to green.
- ""zup"" leads to yellow.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to correspond to the repetition of the color that comes before it. The repeated color spans the number of syllables present in ""walm"" (which has one syllable). 

Here's the breakdown of the rule:

- ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue"" (The color before ""walm"" is ""blue"", and it's repeated three times after ""walm"".)
  
- ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red"" (The color before ""walm"" is ""yellow"", and it's repeated three times after ""walm"" before a new color word ""dax"" appears.)

- ""wif lug dax walm"" -> ""red blue green green green"" (The color before ""walm"" is ""green"", and it's repeated three times after ""walm"".)

- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"" (The color before ""walm"" is ""yellow"", and it's repeated three times. ""walm"" appears at the end with no color word following it.)

- ""lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"" (The color before ""walm"" is ""yellow"", and it's repeated three times after ""walm"" before a new color word ""lug"" appears.)

Taking the given examples as a guide:

walm -> meaning. Meaning is the repetition of the previous color word, repeated three times, representing the number of occurrences for the single-syllable word ""walm"".

Rule: If X is a color word followed by ""walm,"" the output will be X repeated three additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples given where the word ""lug"" is consistently translated into ""blue,"" it is deducible that:

lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's consider the patterns of/Input and Output pairs provided:

1. When the input contains only ""dax wif,"" the output is ""green red."" Therefore, ""dax"" might correspond to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

2. With the input ""dax walm,"" the output is ""green green green."" Here, ""dax"" might still correspond to ""green,"" and ""walm"" doesn't seem to change the output color but rather alters the number of times ""green"" is produced, which is thrice.

3. The input ""zup bluf dax"" yields the output ""yellow yellow green."" From this example, it appears ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" also to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" remains consistent with ""green.""

4. For the input ""zup dax lug walm zup lug,"" the output is ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue."" This input has multiple words, showing that ""zup"" continues to match with ""yellow,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""walm"" possibly indicating repetition since after ""lug walm,"" we see ""blue"" three times. It aligns with the repetition observed with ""walm"" in the second example.

5. Finally, the input ""dax bluf zup"" and the output ""green green yellow"" reinforce that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""bluf"" to ""yellow"", with ""zup"" yielding yellow, indicating that the order of words impacts the output.

Based on the patterns observed, the rule for ""dax"" is consistent across all examples, where ""dax"" directly translates to ""green."" Thus:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided:

Whenever the word ""wif"" is present in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output. The number of times ""red"" appears corresponds to the number of words that follow ""wif,"" including ""wif"" itself. It's also important to note that ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule can be formulated as:

wif -> ""red"" for each occurrence of ""wif"" and for each word that follows ""wif"" in the input sequence.

Rule: For each occurrence of ""wif"" and each word following it in the input, output ""red."" If ""zup"" appears before ""wif,"" output ""yellow"" before the sequence of ""red""s corresponding to ""wif"" and the words that follow.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" adds the color ""yellow"" to the output sequence. However, its position relative to the other words seems to influence the output by duplicating the colors corresponding to the words that come before it. 

To break it down:

- When ""zup"" follows ""dax"" (which corresponds to the color green), we see ""yellow"" added after ""green"" in the output.
- When ""zup"" is surrounded by ""walm"" (which corresponds to the color red), ""yellow"" is added after a repetition of ""red"" colors.
- When ""zup"" follows ""lug"" (which represents the color blue), again ""yellow"" comes after ""blue"" in the output.

So, in short, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and triggers the repetition of the color(s) that appear before it in the input. Let's apply the rule:

Rule: ""zup"" means ""yellow"" and causes the repetition of preceding color(s). 

Thus, ""zup"" -> ""yellow"" and repeat previous colors.
To deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns in the examples provided:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" and the sequence ""walm,"" resulting in two reds followed by three greens. Since ""bluf"" does not seem to correlate with ""green"" directly (as we will see in other examples), it seems that it turns subsequent words until the end of the sequence into ""green.""

2. In the second example, ""bluf"" is the last word, and it corresponds to ""red."" This indicates that ""bluf"" itself, when it's the final word, turns into ""red.""

3. In the third example, ""lug"" directly follows ""bluf"" and corresponds to ""blue."" ""zup"" at the end translates to ""yellow."" This suggests that ""bluf"" doesn't inherently mean ""blue"" or ""yellow,"" and its influence ends before ""zup.”

4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and both translate to ""green."" This implies that ""bluf"" doesn't always turn the previous word or following words into ""green."" 

5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" (green) and followed by ""wif"" (red), while itself being rendered as ""green."" This suggests that ""bluf"" can turn itself and possibly subsequent words into ""green,"" except at the end of a sequence where it is red.

Based on these observations, a possible rule for ""bluf"" is that it turns itself and subsequent words into ""green"" until a different color is encountered or until the sequence ends, in which case ""bluf"" is red when it is the final word.

Rule: bluf -> When not at the end of a sequence, turns itself and subsequent words into ""green"" until another color (not green) occurs; if ""bluf"" is at the end, it translates to ""red.""
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" appears to represent a repetition of the color associated with the word right before it. For each occurrence of ""walm"", the color of the preceding word is repeated three times.

Here is the breakdown of each input and output, with the associated color for each word:

1. dax zup dax walm -> green yellow green green green
- dax is green
- zup is yellow
- walm comes after dax which is green, so it is green repeated three times

2. lug wif lug walm zup walm wif -> blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
- lug is blue
- wif is red
- walm comes after lug which is blue, so it is blue repeated three times
- zup is yellow
- walm comes after zup which is yellow, so it is yellow repeated three times
- wif is red

3. lug walm -> blue blue blue
- lug is blue
- walm comes after lug which is blue, so it is blue repeated three times

The rule appears consistent throughout all the examples provided.

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" represents the color of the preceding word repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm dax
    ",Output: yellow green green green,yellow yellow yellow green,False,76
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in every instance it appears in the examples.
From the given examples, it appears that the output generates a sequence of color words. Each input word is mapped to a specific color in the output. The repeated occurrence of the same input word leads to the repeated occurrence of its corresponding color in the output.

Here is what we can deduce from each example:

1. Input: ""dax walm wif walm zup"" leads to ""green green green red red red yellow""
   This suggests:
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""walm"" also corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

2. Input: ""lug walm dax"" leads to ""blue blue blue green""
   This suggests:
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" (confirmed from the first example), but here it appears as blue possibly because it follows ""lug""
   - ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green"" since it's the last word in the sequence and translates to green when it follows a ""walm"" that corresponded to blue.

3. Input: ""dax"" leads to ""green""
    This confirms that ""dax"" on its own corresponds to ""green"".

4. Input: ""dax zup"" leads to ""green yellow""
    Since we know ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" this example confirms again that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

5. Input: ""wif dax wif"" leads to ""red green red""
    This shows that regardless of its position, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Based on the above analysis, the rule seems to be that each word is consistently translated to a specific color, regardless of its position in the sequence (except for the ""walm"" instance, which may be contextually dependent). However, given the examples, the consistent result is that:

Rule: ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green"".
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Here is how the rule applies in each case:

- In the first example, ""lug wif"" translates to ""blue red,"" with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif dax lug walm"" becomes ""red green blue blue blue,"" with the first word ""wif"" clearly translating to ""red.""
- The third example, ""zup dax wif zup,"" translates to ""yellow green red yellow,"" with ""wif"" again corresponding to ""red.""
- The fourth example is just ""wif"" on its own, and the output is ""red.""
- The fifth example, ""wif zup,"" becomes ""red yellow,"" with ""wif"" being the first color, ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""

Here is the breakdown of each input and its corresponding output to support this conclusion:

- In the first example, ""zup"" appears twice and both times it is translated to ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" is sandwiched between two ""lug,"" which correspond to ""blue."" ""Zup"" again becomes ""yellow,"" maintaining consistency.
- In the third example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and it is repeated three times to match ""walm."" Since ""zup"" comes before ""wif walm"" and the output is ""yellow red red red,"" it implies that ""zup"" is once again ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, we start and end with ""lug"" which matches up with ""blue."" Since ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"" and from previous examples we see that ""walm"" seems to repeat the color preceding it (in this case, making ""yellow"" repeat), it suggests that ""zup"" stands for ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" which has been translated to ""yellow yellow."" There is no prior example of ""bluf,"" but if we take ""bluf"" to repeat the color of ""zup,"" it supports that ""zup"" would be ""yellow.""

Therefore, based on the available information, the rule is:

zup -> ""yellow""
Rule: bluf -> the color of the preceding word. 

Based on the input and output pairs:

- ""zup lug bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue blue"", suggesting that ""bluf"" takes the color of ""lug"" which is blue.
- ""dax bluf"" becomes ""green green"", suggesting that ""bluf"" takes the color of ""dax"" which is green.
- ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"" where the occurrence of ""bluf"" after ""lug"" results in ""blue"" following the pattern.
- ""dax zup bluf"" becomes ""green yellow yellow"" where ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the color is yellow.
- ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue green green"" where ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the color is green.

Therefore, ""bluf"" represents the color of the word right before it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we will analyze the patterns in the given examples and their corresponding outputs.

- In Example 1 (""wif walm""), ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red red red"". ""Walm"" seems to add two additional ""red"" to the output.

- In Example 2 (""dax wif walm""), ""walm"" follows ""wif"" again, and we now have ""green red red red"". We can see that ""dax"" correlates with ""green"", and the ""walm"" adds two more ""red"" after ""wif"".

- In Example 3 (""lug walm zup lug zup wif""), ""walm"" is between ""lug"" and ""zup"" and does not immediately follow ""wif"". Here ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"" and ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"". There is no repetition of ""blue"" after ""walm"", which means the rule of ""walm"" may only apply when it follows ""wif"".

- In Example 4 (""wif bluf dax walm""), ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and not directly after ""wif"". The output ""red red green green green,"" where ""bluf"" doesn't seem to affect the color pattern, implies ""dax"" still correlates to ""green"". Since ""walm"" doesn't immediately follow ""wif,"" it does not add additional reds.

- In Example 5 (""dax walm""), without ""wif"" preceding ""walm,"" we only have ""green green green"", suggesting ""walm"" by itself (without ""wif"" before it) simply repeats the color associated with the previous word (""dax"").

From these observations, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the color output of the directly preceding word unless it directly follows ""wif,"" in which case it adds two additional ""red"".

Rule: When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", it adds two more red to the output. When ""walm"" follows any other word, it repeats the color of that word.

So, walm -> meaning is as follows:
- After ""wif"": Adds two additional instances of ""red"" to the output.
- After any other word: Repeats the color associated with the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax
    ",Output: yellow green,yellow green,True,77
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Analyzing the examples provided, let's identify the pattern by comparing the inputs to their respective outputs:

Input: dax walm zup lug
Output: green green green yellow blue

- Here, ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""walm"" to blue, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""lug"" is the new word with no established meaning. It corresponds to blue in this context.

Input: dax lug
Output: green blue

- Again, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""lug"" to blue.

Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
Output: blue green green yellow blue red

- ""lug"" corresponds to blue at the beginning and end, ""dax"" to green, ""bluf"" to green as well, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""wif"" to red.

Input: zup lug
Output: yellow blue

- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""lug"" to blue.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

- ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""lug"" to blue, and ""walm"" to blue.

From all the given data points, it is clear that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present. There is no instance where ""lug"" does not correspond to blue in the outputs. 

Therefore, the rule for lug is as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in the outputs. Whenever ""dax"" is used in the input, ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. For example, in the first input where ""dax"" is used twice (""dax lug dax lug walm""), the corresponding output is ""green blue green blue blue blue"", with ""green"" appearing at both positions where ""dax"" was used in the input.

Given this consistent mapping, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, there's a consistent pattern where the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" seems to be associated with a specific color as part of a sequence. Each different nonce word corresponds to a color. The color following ""zup"" appears to be consistent across all examples, regardless of its position in the input. 

Analyzing the patterns:

- ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"".
- ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"".
- ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"".

Given these consistent mappings, we can conclude that ""zup"" directly translates to the color ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> translates to the color ""yellow"".
From the examples provided, it is evident that ""bluf"" always outputs a doubling of the color associated with the previous word. Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be to repeat the color that corresponds to the word that comes immediately before it. Here's the analysis of each input and output pair:

- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"": ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"", so ""bluf"" means repeating ""red"".
- ""wif bluf dax lug"" -> ""red red green blue"": ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and again results in ""red red"". ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"".
- ""lug wif bluf"" -> ""blue red red"": ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and results in a repetition of ""red"".
- ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green yellow red green green"": ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", so it repeats ""green"".
- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"": ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""dax"", which is ""green"".

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""bluf"".
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the given examples and their respective outputs while focusing on the occurrences of ""walm.""

Input: dax walm lug
Output: green green green blue
Observation: ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green green"" with a following ""green"".

Input: lug wif dax walm zup
Output: blue red green green green yellow
Observation: ""walm"" follows ""dax"" once more, and we have ""green green green"" after ""green green"".

Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
Observation: Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the output is ""blue blue green"". It's the first green after a series of ""blue"".

Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
Output: green green green red blue green green green
Observation: ""walm"" is again following ""dax"" and we see the pattern of ""green green"" followed by another ""green"".

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red
Observation: Once again, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and leads to a ""green green green"" sequence in the output after ""green green"".

From the outputs, we can see that each instance of ""walm"" is followed by a ""green"" in the output. Moreover, when looking at the context, ""walm"" appears to follow a pattern where it is preceded by a word that corresponds to ""green"" in the output (""dax""). 

Rule:
We can postulate that ""walm"" represents the continuation of the color associated with the previous word (in this case, ""green"" is the color associated with ""dax""). If that word corresponds to ""green"" in the output, then ""walm"" will also correspond to ""green.""

walm -> ""the same color as the immediately preceding word"" (in these examples, that color is green because walm follows ""dax,"" which is associated with green).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax wif
    ",Output: blue green red,blue green red,True,78
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following mappings for each word to its corresponding color:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> green (based on the third example, where ""bluf"" appears before ""wif"" and the output is ""green red"")
- walm -> blue yellow (based on the fifth example, ""walm"" corresponds to two colors ""blue yellow"" whenever it appears)

For the word ""lug,"" the common factor in each example is that it consistently maps to the color blue. In every instance ""lug"" appears, the output includes the color blue at that position.

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, it corresponds with the color ""green"" in the output. This is consistent across all given examples, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence.
Rule: wif → red

Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.

Input: zup wif Output: yellow red – Here, ""wif"" translates to ""red"" at the end of the sequence.
Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red – Again, ""wif"" is at the end of the sequence and translates to ""red"".
Input: dax walm wif Output: green green green red – ""wif"" is at the end and the corresponding output is ""red"".
Input: wif zup walm dax zup Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow – Even when ""wif"" appears at the beginning, it still translates to ""red"".
Input: zup dax wif Output: yellow green red – ""wif"" is at the end of the sequence and the corresponding output is ""red"".

Every instance of ""wif"" in the examples results in ""red"" in the corresponding output, regardless of its position in the sequence of words.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" results in the output of a color sequence, where the color repeated is determined by the word that precedes ""bluf.""

Here is the pattern that can be observed from the examples:

1. wif bluf -> red red (The word ""bluf"" repeats the color output of ""wif."")
2. lug wif bluf -> blue red red (The word ""bluf"" repeats the color output of ""wif."")
3. zup bluf wif -> yellow yellow red (The word ""bluf"" repeats the color output of ""zup."")
4. lug bluf dax lug -> blue blue green blue (The word ""bluf"" repeats the color output of ""lug."")
5. zup bluf dax lug -> yellow yellow green blue (The word ""bluf"" repeats the color output of ""zup."")

From this, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color output of the preceding word.

Using this rule, if we know the color output associated with the word that comes before ""bluf,"" we can predict that ""bluf"" will result in repeating that color output.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the examples given:

1. lug walm zup lug zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
2. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
3. wif dax lug walm -> red green blue blue blue
4. lug walm wif -> blue blue blue red
5. dax lug wif walm -> green blue red red red

Observing the input and output sequences, let's focus on ""walm."" The word ""walm"" in the inputs always results in repeated colors in the output. More specifically, it results in repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm."" For example:

- In the first input, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" is associated with blue, and ""walm"" causes the repetition.
  
- In the second input, ""lug walm"" is ""blue blue blue,"" consistent with the previous example.
  
- In the third input, ""lug walm"" is again ""blue blue blue"" following the same pattern.
  
- In the fourth input, ""lug walm"" is again ""blue blue blue.""
  
- In the fifth input, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red,"" where ""wif"" is associated with red, following the same repetition pattern for ""walm.""

From these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word that precedes it to repeat three times. 

Thus, the rule for the word ""walm"" is:

walm -> repeats the color of the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow blue,yellow yellow blue,True,79
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in every provided example.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position or the other words around it. Every appearance of ""dax"" in the input results in ""green"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Here's how the rule applies to each example:

Input: lug dax wif lug
Output: blue green red blue
Rule applied: lug -> blue, dax -> green, wif -> red

Input: wif dax lug
Output: red green blue
Rule applied: wif -> red, dax -> green, lug -> blue

Input: dax zup walm wif
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
Rule applied: dax -> green, zup -> yellow, walm -> yellow, wif -> red

Input: dax wif
Output: green red
Rule applied: dax -> green, wif -> red

Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
Rule applied: zup -> yellow, dax -> green, bluf -> green, wif -> red, lug -> blue

The rule for ""wif"" appears to be consistent across all examples, regardless of its position or the other words present.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can infer that each word corresponds to a specific color. The words preceding and following ""zup"" have an associated color in the output:

- ""wif"" always results in the color ""red"".
- ""lug"" always results in the color ""blue"".
- ""dax"" always results in the color ""green"".

When we have ""zup"" followed by these words, the color ""yellow"" appears before the color associated with the following word:

- ""zup wif"" results in ""yellow red"".
- ""zup dax"" results in ""yellow green"".

Similarly, when ""zup"" precedes or follows ""wif"":

- ""wif zup"" results in ""red yellow"".

Even if other words are present in the input that do not immediately precede or follow ""zup"", they are translated to their designated color, as indicated by the example ""lug walm zup wif"" which results in ""blue blue blue yellow red"", despite the word ""walm"" not appearing in any of the other examples.

Therefore the rule seems to be that for any given instance of ""zup"" in an input, the corresponding output includes the color ""yellow"" at the respective position of the word ""zup"".

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look at the way it's used in different contexts within the given examples. Let's examine how ""bluf"" correlates with the output in each example.

- In the first example, ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red."" Since ""wif"" on its own corresponds to ""red,"" it seems that ""bluf"" also represents ""red"" here.
- In the second example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" outputs ""red red green green green."" We know ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""dax"" is ""green,"" which leaves ""walm"" to be ""green"" as well. ""Bluf"" here is also followed by ""red,"" consistent with the first example.
- In the third example, ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" outputs ""green red yellow yellow red red red."" ""Dax"" corresponds with ""green,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow."" Since the appearance of ""bluf"" is directly followed by ""red,"" it seems that ""bluf"" must also correlate with ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup bluf wif bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow red red."" Here ""zup"" matches ""yellow,"" ""wif"" matches ""red,"" and ""bluf"" which is present twice, is followed by ""red"" each time.
- In the fifth example, ""dax bluf zup bluf dax"" outputs ""green green yellow yellow green."" ""Dax"" has already been established as correlating with ""green,"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow."" ""Bluf"" is directly followed by ""green"" here, which deviates from the previous patterns. However, if we assume that ""bluf"" may repeat the color associated with the preceding word, then the pattern would hold, because ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" and then follows ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""

From these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the previous word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze each input and its corresponding output:

1. lug walm wif -> blue blue blue red
2. lug wif lug walm zup walm wif -> blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
3. wif walm dax -> red red red green
4. lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
5. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue

Looking at the patterns, ""lug"" seems to consistently translate to ""blue,"" ""wif"" seems to consistently correspond to ""red,"" and ""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green."" ""Zup"" is a bit less consistent, but in the context where it appears before ""walm,"" it leads to a repetition of ""yellow.""

In every instance, ""walm"" appears to add additional instances of the previously-mentioned color rather than introducing a new color itself:

1. After ""lug"" (which is blue), ""walm"" adds two more blues.
2. After ""lug"" (blue), ""walm"" adds one more blue. Again, after ""zup"" (yellow), ""walm"" adds two more yellows.
3. After ""wif"" (red), ""walm"" adds two more reds.
4. ""Walm"" adds two more yellows after ""zup"" (yellow).
5. After ""lug"" (blue), ""walm"" adds two more blues.

Based on the patterns, it seems that ""walm"" represents a rule where the word repeats the color of the previous word, doing so twice. Hence:

Rule: walm -> When following a color word, repeat that color word two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. 

Based on the given examples where the input `lug` consistently equates to the output `blue`, the meaning of `lug` is straightforward.

Rule: lug means blue.
Observing the inputs and outputs, we can attempt to induce the rules associated with the word ""dax"" and other words in the examples. 

Here's the pattern that appears to be associated with each word:

- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" no matter its position in the input. 
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"".
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"".
- ""bluf"" consistently translates to another ""red"".
- ""walm"" has only appeared once and is followed by three ""green"" in output, which implies repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, which is ""dax"".
- ""lug"" has only appeared once and it translates to ""blue"".

According to this pattern, the rule seems to be that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color yellow in each of the provided examples.
bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" means ""red"". However, it is preceded by a color word that corresponds to its own sequence of colors but repeated. For example, if ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""bluf"" appears after ""lug"", it will be translated as ""blue red"". If ""bluf"" appears without any preceding color word, it translates only as ""red"".
Based on the examples provided, walm corresponds to a series of ""blue"" outputs. The number of times ""blue"" appears corresponds to the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence:

1. ""zup wif walm lug"" outputs ""yellow red red red blue"" - ""walm"" is the third word and is followed by ""lug"", giving us one ""blue"".
2. ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue"" - ""walm"" is the second and last word, resulting in three ""blue"" outputs.
3. ""wif dax lug walm"" outputs ""red green blue blue blue"" - ""walm"" is the fourth and last word, so we get three ""blue"" outputs.
4. ""lug walm wif zup wif"" outputs ""blue blue blue red yellow red"" - ""walm"" is the second word, followed by three other words, resulting in three ""blue"" outputs.
5. ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue"" - ""walm"" is the second word and followed by no other words, giving us three ""blue"" outputs again.

The rule seems to be that ""walm"" dictates that the output should be ""blue"" repeated a number of times. This number is one less than the total number of words that come after ""walm"" in the input sequence. When ""walm"" is the last word, the number of ""blue"" outputs is equal to the position of ""walm"".

Hence, the rule for walm is: walm -> a series of ""blue"" outputs. The number of ""blue"" outputs is one less than the number of words following ""walm"" if there are any, or equal to its position in the sequence if it is the last word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,81
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue,"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

- In the first example, ""lug dax zup"" translates to ""blue green yellow."" Since ""dax"" is positioned between ""lug"" (blue) and ""zup"" (yellow), it is reasonable to assume that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" alone translates to ""green,"" which supports our assumption from the first example.
- In the third example, ""lug dax wif lug"" translates to ""blue green red blue."" Here again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" further supporting our assumption.
- In the fourth example, ""dax lug"" translates to ""green blue,"" with ""dax"" once more corresponding to ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" by itself translates to ""green,"" which is consistent with the other examples.

Based on these observations, the rule we can induce is:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, there appears to be a pattern where the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Other words correspond to different colors consistently, such as ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is present in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output. No other word in the input correlates with ""yellow"" consistently across examples. To clarify:

- In the first example, ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" translates to ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue."" Here ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" with ""walm"" also translating to ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""zup lug dax lug"" becomes ""yellow blue green blue,"" where ""lug"" remains ""blue,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" is ""green.""
- In the third example, ""zup wif"" corresponds to ""yellow red,"" reaffirming the meanings of ""zup"" and ""wif.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax zup bluf"" becomes ""green yellow yellow,"" with ""zup"" consistently being ""yellow"" and ""dax"" continuing to be ""green."" It's not entirely clear what ""bluf"" means, but in this single instance, it translates to ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif bluf lug zup"" results in ""red red blue yellow,"" once again consistent with ""zup"" meaning ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" causes the output word to repeat in color what precedes it. Looking at the first input ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug,"" the word following ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color red. As a result, ""bluf"" causes the next output color (blue) to repeat once before continuing with the corresponding colors for the remaining input words.

Here is a breakdown to illustrate:

- ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" -> ""blue blue (bluf causes blue to repeat) red (wif) blue (lug) red (wif) red (walm) red (lug) blue (lug)""
- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow (bluf causes yellow to repeat)""
- ""lug bluf zup"" -> ""blue blue (bluf causes blue to repeat) yellow (zup)""
- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green (bluf causes green to repeat)""
- ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" -> ""blue (lug) red (walm) blue (wif changed by bluf) blue (lug) blue (bluf causes blue to repeat)""

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: bluf -> causes the next color to repeat once.
Based on the presented examples, the word ""walm"" seems to have the following rule associated with it:

""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the last color mentioned immediately before it.

To demonstrate this, here is the rule applied to each of the given examples:

Example 1:
Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
Translation: blue blue green blue yellow (walm repeats ""yellow"") yellow yellow blue
Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Example 2:
Input: zup wif walm lug
Translation: yellow red (walm repeats ""red"") red red blue
Output: yellow red red red blue

Example 3:
Input: zup walm dax
Translation: yellow (walm repeats ""yellow"") yellow yellow green
Output: yellow yellow yellow green

Example 4:
Input: zup dax walm
Translation: yellow green (walm repeats ""green"") green green
Output: yellow green green green

Example 5:
Input: lug walm wif zup wif
Translation: blue (walm repeats ""blue"") blue blue red yellow red
Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm -> repetition of the last mentioned color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug
    ",Output: red blue,red blue,True,82
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color green in the output. Each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green,"" regardless of its position or context in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" regardless of what follows it. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""red"".
zup -> ""yellow""

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" each time it is used, regardless of its position within the sequence of words. The other words correspond to different colors (""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""bluf"" to ""green""), but ""zup"" consistently represents ""yellow.""
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" directly corresponds to the color ""green"" in every instance it has been used. An analysis of each input and corresponding output verifies this:

- Input: ""dax bluf wif lug"" corresponds to Output: ""green green red blue"". Here ""bluf"" aligns with the second ""green"".
- Input: ""zup dax bluf"" corresponds to Output: ""yellow green green"". Here ""bluf"" aligns with the second ""green"".
- Input: ""wif bluf dax"" corresponds to Output: ""red red green"". Here ""bluf"" aligns with the second ""red"", which given the position and unique translation of other words, suggests ""bluf"" is ""green"".
- Input: ""lug wif bluf lug wif"" corresponds to Output: ""blue red red blue red"". The ""bluf"" here comes out as the second ""red"" in the output, considering that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red"".
- Input: ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" corresponds to Output: ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow"". Here it is clear that ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""yellow"". Note that ""zup"" seems to correspond with ""yellow"" and ""lug"" with ""blue"".

By examining all these instances, it is reasonable to deduce:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the color ""green"". Rule: The word ""bluf"" is always translated into the color ""green"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here's the analysis:

In the first example, ""lug zup dax walm"" translates to ""blue yellow green green green."" The word before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" which correlates to ""green,"" hence ""walm"" leads to an output of ""green green green.""

In the second example, ""zup walm"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""Walm"" follows the word ""zup,"" which correlates to ""yellow,"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow.""

In the third example, ""wif lug dax walm"" translates to ""red blue green green green."" Here ""walm"" again follows ""dax,"" which means ""green,"" resulting in ""green green green.""

In the fourth example, ""lug walm wif lug"" is ""blue blue blue red blue."" ""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" which means ""blue,"" leading to a repetition of ""blue.""

In the fifth example, ""zup dax walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow green green green blue red."" Here, after ""dax"" which means ""green,"" ""walm"" results in ""green green green.""

Rule: walm -> The meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color output of the word preceding it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
From the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" by examining its context and comparing the inputs with their respective outputs. Let's analyze the occurrences:

- Every time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Here are the patterns extracted from the examples:

1. Input: dax lug zup dax
   Output: green blue yellow green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

2. Input: zup lug
   Output: yellow blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

3. Input: lug dax wif lug
   Output: blue green red blue
   - Both instances of ""lug"" correspond to ""blue"".

4. Input: dax lug wif
   Output: green blue red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

5. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

Based on these observations, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" in this context is consistent:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Let's break down each example:

1. Input: wif dax wif
   Output: red green red
   - Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the presence of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

2. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   - In this example, ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green,"" while ""walm"" seems to repeat its corresponding color (""green"") for each subsequent instance. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

3. Input: zup bluf dax
   Output: yellow yellow green
   - This indicates that ""zup"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

4. Input: lug dax lug
   Output: blue green blue
   - Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

5. Input: dax lug bluf wif
   Output: green blue blue red
   - Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

Thus, the rule can be formulated as:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided:

Input: dax wif -> Output: green red
Input: wif lug bluf wif zup -> Output: red blue blue red yellow
Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
Input: wif -> Output: red
Input: wif -> Output: red

The word ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding context. As such, the meaning of ""wif"" does not appear to be dependent on context but is instead a fixed output.

wif -> meaning: red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the output will be ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, we can infer a pattern for the meaning of the word ""zup"" and its correlation with colors.

In each instance, the word ""zup"" corresponds with the color yellow in the output. Regardless of its position in the input sentence, ""zup"" consistently maps to yellow. Other words like ""dax,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""walm"" seem to have a one-to-one correspondence with other colors: ""dax"" with green, ""wif"" with red, ""lug"" with blue, and ""walm"" with yellow, the same as ""zup.""

Given this consistent pattern, we can conclude the following rule:

Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color yellow. 

Restated in the requested format:

zup -> yellow.
Reviewing the input-output pairs:

1. **zup** bluf → yellow yellow
2. **dax lug** walm **dax wif** bluf **dax** → green blue blue blue green red red green
3. **zup** bluf **lug zup** walm → yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
4. **zup** bluf **wif lug dax** → yellow yellow red blue green
5. **lug** bluf **zup lug** → blue blue yellow blue

From these examples, it seems that the output before and after the word ""bluf"" is the same color if it directly follows a single word:
- Example 1: ""zup"" before and after ""bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow"".
- Example 3: ""zup"" before ""bluf"" and ""lug"" after ""bluf"" leads to a change in color (yellow yellow blue).
- Example 5: ""lug"" before and after ""bluf"" leads to ""blue blue"".

However, in the cases where ""bluf"" is surrounded by more complex sequences, the output color changes:
- Example 2: The colors before and after ""bluf"" are ""green"" and ""red,"" respectively, and there are multiple words before and after.
- Example 4: ""bluf"" is followed by multiple words, and each has a differing output color.

The output change that occurs in the multi-word contexts before or after ""bluf"" involves a sequence of words linked to specific colors.

To surmise the rule for ""bluf,"" let's lay it out:

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" is surrounded by the same word (e.g., ""zup bluf zup""), the output is the same color twice. When ""bluf"" is surrounded by different words, it seems to have no consistent pattern that determines its output color.

Based on this assessment, the most consistent rule regarding ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: When ""bluf"" follows or is followed by the same word, the output color is repeated; otherwise, the output color seems to depend on other factors, perhaps related to the sequence and specific words surrounding ""bluf"".

If we consider the context in example 2 specifically:
- ""dax lug"" results in ""green blue"".
- ""dax wif"" results in ""green red"".
- ""bluf dax"" results in ""red green"".

It suggests a possible extra nuance that ""bluf"" may have an output related to the color associated with a subsequent noun when ""bluf"" appears in the sequence before other words. However, this pattern is not strongly supported by example 4's result of ""bluf wif lug dax"" → ""yellow red blue green,"" so this component of the rule is less certain without more evidence. 

Therefore, a cautious interpretation of the rule is as stated above.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to have an effect on the output that depends on the preceding word. The rule appears to be that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times. 

To verify this rule, let's look at each example:

1. ""zup walm wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" indicating that ""walm"" after ""zup"" (yellow) results in three yellows.

2. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" so after ""dax"" (green), ""walm"" produces three greens.

3. ""dax lug walm"" yields ""green blue blue blue."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and results in three blues.

4. ""lug walm wif zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue red yellow red,"" where ""walm"" follows ""lug"" again, producing three blues.

5. ""zup wif dax walm"" results in ""yellow red green green green."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) and thus produces three greens.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: When following a word that translates to a color, ""walm"" repeats that color three times in the output. 

Hence, walm -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf
    ",Output: yellow yellow,yellow yellow,True,84
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" in each example corresponds to the color ""blue"".
Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following occurrences of dax and their corresponding outputs:

1. lug dax -> blue green
2. dax zup walm wif -> green yellow yellow yellow red
3. zup bluf lug dax lug -> yellow yellow blue green blue
4. dax walm zup walm -> green green green yellow yellow yellow
5. dax wif walm -> green red red red

In the first example, the word ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and following ""dax,"" the output is green. In the third example, ""lug"" is also followed by ""dax"" and the output sequence again has blue followed by green. This suggests that ""dax"" might be the word that follows ""lug"" and corresponds to green.

Furthermore, in all the examples provided, whenever ""dax"" is present, ""green"" is the first color in the output sequence. This consistent presence of ""green"" whenever ""dax"" occurs indicates that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: dax translates to green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the outputs provided. It appears that ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red"" regardless of its position in the input string or the other words present.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Every time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output at the same position. 

Here is the inferred rule:
zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or the rule associated with the nonce word ""bluf."" To do this, we must compare the inputs and their corresponding outputs to find a consistent pattern.

Let's examine where ""bluf"" appears and its corresponding output color:

1. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red
2. dax zup wif bluf lug -> green yellow red red blue
3. wif bluf -> red red
4. wif zup bluf lug -> red yellow yellow blue
5. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> blue blue red blue red red red blue

Considering the examples, we notice the following:

- ""bluf"" always corresponds to ""red"" in the output.
- The position of ""bluf"" in the input does not seem to affect the output; it consistently maps to ""red.""
- Other words (e.g., ""dax,"" ""walm,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""wif"") map to different colors depending on their position or surrounding words.

With these observations, we can deduce that the rule for ""bluf"" is consistent and independent of context:

bluf -> meaning. Rule: ""bluf"" always corresponds to the color ""red.""
To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" we can examine the patterns in the inputs and outputs provided. Specifically, we are interested in how the presence of ""walm"" in the input affects the corresponding output colors.

Let's consider each example and note the output colors corresponding to the presence of ""walm"":

Example 1: 
- Input: ""wif walm dax zup""
- Output: ""red red red green yellow""
Here, the word ""walm"" corresponds to the second ""red"" output.

Example 2:
- Input: ""wif bluf dax walm""
- Output: ""red red green green green""
In this case, ""walm"" corresponds to the third ""green"" output.

Example 3:
- Input: ""zup dax walm lug wif""
- Output: ""yellow green green green blue red""
Here, ""walm"" corresponds to the third ""green"" output again.

Example 4:
- Input: ""zup walm""
- Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
""walm"" corresponds to the second and third ""yellow"" outputs.

Example 5:
- Input: ""zup wif dax walm""
- Output: ""yellow red green green green""
In this case, ""walm"" corresponds to the last two ""green"" outputs.

From the above examples, we can see a pattern: 

1. The presence of ""walm"" always results in ""green"" in the output, except for example 4, where ""walm"" generates ""yellow."" This suggests that ""walm"" could take on the color of the word that precedes it.

2. Example 4 also shows that when ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" both instances are ""yellow."" This is the only example where ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" and the pattern of the same color repeating is not contradicted in the given dataset.

3. In Example 1, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red."" In Example 5, ""wif"" also precedes the first ""green,"" but ""walm"" appears later in the sequence, which might indicate that the position of ""walm"" after a certain number of words influences the color output.

Based on this evidence, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it unless there is a positional influence that overrides this pattern. However, the given examples are not sufficient to firmly establish the positional influence rule because they are too few and partially conflicting (considering Example 1).

Given that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it except in unclear positional circumstances, the most consistent rule we can derive is:

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the preceding word. If the preceding word is ""zup,"" the color is yellow; if it is any other word, the color is green. The rule for positional influence is unclear due to insufficient data.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif zup dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it is clear that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color in the output. For instance, ""wif"" always results in ""red,"" ""zup"" always results in ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" always results in ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" 

Since the input ""lug"" consistently leads to the output ""blue"" in all instances, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present, we can deduce the meaning of ""lug.""

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""dax"" is consistently translated to the color ""green."" Regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it, ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green.""

Therefore, the rule is:
dax -> green
wif -> ""red""

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in every instance it appears.
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the term ""yellow"" appears in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns in relation to the input and output examples given:

1. In the first example, every time ""lug"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue."" So ""lug bluf"" seems to translate to ""blue blue."" However, when ""lug"" appears without ""bluf,"" the output is ""red,"" therefore ""lug"" alone translates to ""red.""

2. In the second example, ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow blue yellow yellow."" Focusing on the end of the sequence where ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" we can see that ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow"" in the output, unlike the expected ""blue"" from the first example.

3. In the third example, ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow."" Assuming ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" the presence of ""bluf"" here again results in ""yellow.""

4. Following the pattern, in the fourth example, ""zup lug bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue blue."" Here ""zup lug"" seems to translate to ""yellow blue,"" and with the addition of ""bluf,"" it results in another ""blue.""

5. In the fifth example, ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup"" translates to ""yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow."" Following our established understanding of the other words, every time ""bluf"" appears, the color mentioned just before it is repeated in the output.

Extracting the pattern from these examples, it appears that ""bluf"" acts as an instruction to repeat the color word that precedes it. Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the preceding color.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to identify patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs, focusing on where ""walm"" occurs:

1. In the first example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif,"" the output sequence is ""red red green green red red red blue red."" We can observe that ""walm"" comes right after ""wif"" and before ""lug,"" corresponding to the colors ""red blue.""

2. In the second example, ""dax walm,"" the output sequence is ""green green green."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes no other word, with the output being ""green"" repeated three times.

3. In the third example, ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm,"" the output sequence is ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue."" Again, ""walm"" follows both ""wif"" and ""lug,"" corresponding to sequences ""red blue blue.""

4. In the fourth example, ""zup wif lug zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow."" ""Walm"" comes after ""zup,"" resulting in ""yellow"" repeated three times.

5. In the fifth example, ""wif walm dax,"" the output sequence is ""red red red green."" Similar to the second and third examples, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" as well as ""dax,"" aligning again with the color ""red.""

The rule here seems to be related to the word following ""walm,"" and there may also be a prefix pattern attached to ""walm"" that defines its color output:

- Following ""wif,"" the word ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- Following ""dax,"" the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repeating of the current color, hence ""green green green.""
- Following ""lug"" and ""zup,"" the word ""walm"" results in the color before ""walm"" to repeat.

With this in mind, we can establish the following rule:
walm -> meaning. After ""wif,"" ""walm"" translates to the color ""red."" After ""dax,"" ""walm"" causes the previous color to repeat. After ""lug"" or ""zup,"" ""walm"" also causes the previous color to repeat.

Rule: The word ""walm"" may indicate a repetition of the previous color or translate to ""red"" when preceded by ""wif."" When it causes a repetition, it repeats the previous color as many times as the number of syllables in the word that comes immediately after ""walm."" The repetition count for ""lug"" and ""zup"" is three times. 

Please note that this rule is inferred with limited data and may not apply if more examples are presented that do not fit this pattern.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" across all examples.
Rule: dax -> green

Explanation: In each example, whenever the word 'dax' appears, the output always includes the color green. There is no change in this output regardless of the position of 'dax' in the input sequence or the presence of other words alongside it. Therefore, it can be deduced that 'dax' corresponds directly and consistently to the color green.
Based on the provided examples, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" The other words appear to translate as follows: ""bluf"" translates to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, the word 'zup' consistently corresponds to the color 'yellow' in the output. There is a one-to-one mapping between the nonce word 'zup' and the color 'yellow', regardless of context or position within the input string.

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
bluf -> blue

Rule: Whenever the nonce word ""bluf"" appears, it corresponds to the color ""blue.""
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to be associated with a repetitive pattern in the output. Specifically, it appears to cause a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. To determine the specific rule, let's break down each example:

1. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
- Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" After ""lug"" comes ""walm,"" and we see a repetition of ""blue"" three times.

2. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" The word ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" leading to ""yellow"" being repeated three times. The last word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

3. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" After that, ""walm"" is present, leading to a repetition of ""green"" two more times. The word ""wif"" then corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" ""Walm"" causes a repetition of ""green"" two more times.

5. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and then ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green."" Finally, ""walm"" leads to ""green"" being repeated three times.

Given these examples, ""walm"" seems to cause the color corresponding to the preceding word to repeat three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color of the word immediately before it to repeat three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,87
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it is clear that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position within the input sequence.

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, each instance of a nonce word correlates with a specific color. Here's the breakdown:

- Each instance of ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red.""
- Each instance of ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green.""
- The word ""walm,"" when it appears before ""dax,"" seems to add an additional ""red"" before the ""green"" that ""dax"" represents.
- The appearance of ""zup"" at the end of a sequence correlates with the color ""yellow.""

Given these observations, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
From the provided examples, we can deduce that each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output. By examining the consistent output across different inputs where the word ""zup"" is used, it is evident that the word ""zup"" always corresponds to the same output color, regardless of its position in the input sequence. The examples show that:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Since ""zup"" alone provides the output ""yellow"" and in every instance where ""zup"" is used in combination with other words, the corresponding output for ""zup"" remains ""yellow"", it's clear that the meaning of ""zup"" is directly mapped to ""yellow"". 

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color indicated by the word that precedes it. In each instance, ""bluf"" immediately follows a color-indicating word and produces a duplicated output of that color. Here's a breakdown of each example:

- ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue"", with the word ""bluf"" duplicating the color indicated by ""lug"" (blue).
- ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" results in ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"", with ""bluf"" again duplicating ""lug"" (blue), and no other instance of ""bluf"" here.
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" results in ""red red green green green"", with ""bluf"" duplicating ""wif"" (red).
- ""wif dax zup bluf"" results in ""red green yellow yellow"", where ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and duplicates the color indicated by it (yellow).
- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"", with ""bluf"" duplicating ""wif"" (red).

The rule seems consistent across all examples given.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color indicated by the word immediately preceding it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the pattern of colors associated with each word in the input and output sequences. Each word seems to correspond with a specific color in the output:

- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""dax"" when it appears translates to ""green.""
- ""lug"" appeared only once but corresponds to ""blue.""

With the word ""walm,"" we observe the following patterns:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax zup,"" and the output for ""walm"" is three ""yellow"" colors followed by a ""green"" for ""dax"" with a ""yellow"" after for another ""zup"". This suggests that ""walm"" is not represented by a single color but potentially by a sequence.

2. In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is three ""red"" colors which correlate to the ""wif"" and ""walm"" combination. This again suggests that ""walm"" contributes to a sequence of the same color that is initiated by ""wif.""

3. In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and is followed by ""dax zup."" The output is three ""red"" colors followed by a ""green"" and a ""yellow,"" which aligns with ""wif,"" ""walm,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup"" respectively. The ""walm"" is again translating to a repetition.

4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" and is represented by three ""yellow"" colors. 

5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" results in four yellow colors in the output, following the pattern of the color before it (representing ""zup"" - yellow).

From these observations, we can deduce a rule for ""walm."" It seems to extend the color of the word immediately preceding it, such that the output for ""walm"" is a repetition of the same color as the word before it.

Rule: walm -> extends the color sequence of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf
    ",Output: yellow yellow,yellow yellow,True,88
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following rule:

lug -> blue

This is evident since every occurrence of ""lug"" in the inputs corresponds to ""blue"" in the outputs.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the output colors are correlated with the position of words in the input sequence, specifically their relationship with the word ""dax"". The word ""dax"" always results in the output ""green"" regardless of its position, suggesting that ""dax"" itself is tied to the color green.

Analyzing the position of ""dax"" in relation to other words:

- When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""green green."" This indicates that ""walm"" in the presence of ""dax"" also yields green.
- When ""dax"" is followed by a sequence of words that are not ""walm,"" such as ""zup wif,"" the first word (""zup"") after ""dax"" results in yellow, while subsequent words result in the color one step darker on the ROYGBIV scale (with ""red"" coming after ""yellow""). 
- When ""dax"" precedes ""lug,"" ""lug"" still results in a color (""blue""), but this color does not directly follow the pattern of ""dax"" preceding other words, suggesting that some words may have intrinsic colors.
- Without the context of additional words that aren't preceded or followed by ""dax,"" it is difficult to make concrete rules about their corresponding colors.

Thus, the rule seems to be:
Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" When followed by other words, the first word after ""dax"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and subsequent words follow in darker ROYGBIV order unless there is an intrinsic color rule that is not defined by the examples given.
Analyzing the provided inputs and outputs, we can deduce the following:

1. ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red"" suggests that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" translates to ""red"". Since ""wif"" is followed by ""red"", we could initially hypothesize that ""wif"" means ""red"".

2. ""wif lug dax"" -> ""red blue green"" implies ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""dax"" is ""green"". However, the initial hypothesis that ""wif"" means ""red"" still holds as ""wif"" comes first and is followed by ""red"".

3. ""lug wif lug wif lug"" -> ""blue red blue red blue"" confirms that ""lug"" means ""blue"" and supports the hypothesis that ""wif"" means ""red"" as every instance of ""wif"" is followed by ""red"".

4. ""dax walm wif bluf"" -> ""green green green red red"" introduces a new word ""walm"", which corresponds to ""green"", same as ""dax"". The pattern suggests that repetitive colors (""green green green"") might be related to repeated new words or the same word (""dax walm""), but the important part for ""wif"" is that it is again followed by ""red"".

5. ""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red"" supports all previous translations and the ""wif"" hypothesis.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be that it is immediately followed by the color ""red"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> red (when followed by a color in the output, that color is ""red"").
Based on the provided examples, we can observe the following correspondences between the inputs containing the nonce word ""zup"" and their outputs:

- Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
- The position of ""zup"" in the input doesn't appear to affect its corresponding output; it is consistently mapped to ""yellow"".
- ""zup"" does not seem to depend on the context of words around it, as its mapping to ""yellow"" remains consistent regardless of what other words (""wif"", ""lug"", ""dax"", ""bluf"") are present.

Given these observations, we deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""zup"" maps to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position or the context in the input sequence.

Hence:
zup -> yellow
From the examples provided, we can observe the following patterns:

- ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green""

When ""bluf"" is paired with another word, the output is a repetition of the color that corresponds to that word. For example:

- In ""zup bluf"", ""zup"" is yellow, and the output is ""yellow yellow"".
- In ""lug bluf"", ""lug"" is blue, and the output is ""blue blue"".
- In ""wif bluf"", ""wif"" is red, and the output is ""red red"".
- In ""dax bluf"", ""dax"" is green, and the output is ""green green"".

Based on these observations, we can induce that ""bluf"" functions as a duplicator of the color output of the word it follows.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color output of the previous word.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the following word to repeat its associated color three times. Here's the break down of the examples:

- ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" is ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""wif"" which gets a single output of ""red,"" repeats three times when followed by ""walm,"" giving ""red red red."" Similarly, ""zup"" usually outputs one ""yellow,"" but it repeats three times to ""yellow yellow yellow"" after ""walm.""
- ""lug walm"" becomes ""blue blue blue."" The word ""lug"" produces ""blue,"" and followed by ""walm"", it repeats to give three ""blue.""
- ""zup walm"" gives us ""yellow yellow yellow."" The word ""zup"" itself translates to ""yellow,"" but it repeats thrice with the influence of ""walm.""
- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green."" The word ""dax"" is ""green,"" which is repeated three times after ""walm.""
- ""lug walm wif bluf"" becomes ""blue blue blue red red."" Again, ""lug"" followed by ""walm"" produces three ""blue,"" and ""wif"" follows the normal rule without the influence of ""walm"" to produce two ""red"" for ""bluf.""

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the subsequent word's associated color to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif
    ",Output: blue red,blue red,True,89
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, it looks like certain words are consistently translated to specific colors. Here's the correlation seen in the examples:

- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""bluf"" -> red (it seems like there might be a mistake since ""bluf"" was translated into red, which is usually for ""wif""; however, we do not have enough context to correct it, hence we will take it at face value)

Thus, the rule appears to be direct word-to-color translations with no additional context changing their meanings. The translations remain consistent regardless of position in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the input-output patterns with particular attention to words accompanying ""wif"" and the color outputs they correspond to.

1. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   Analysis: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""bluf"" to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" also to ""yellow."" ""wif"" appears twice, and both times ""red"" follows.

2. Input: dax bluf wif zup
   Output: green green red yellow
   Analysis: The presence of ""wif"" once again corresponds to ""red,"" following ""bluf,"" which gave ""green"" rather than ""yellow"" this time. ""zup"" remains consistent with ""yellow.""

3. Input: wif
   Output: red
   Analysis: ""wif"" on its own corresponds to ""red,"" reinforcing the pattern.

4. Input: wif bluf lug dax wif
   Output: red red blue green red
   Analysis: ""wif"" starts and ends the sequence with ""red,"" ""bluf"" yields ""red"" instead of ""green"" or ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" yields ""blue.""

5. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   Analysis: ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" produces three ""blue"" instead of ""red.""

It appears that ""wif"" does not change meaning based on context; it consistently results in the output ""red."" Other words seem to have a variable output, but ""wif"" does not. Therefore:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" is consistently translated to the color ""yellow."" Regardless of the context or the words that follow ""zup,"" the output always starts with ""yellow."" There doesn't seem to be a variation in this pattern, so we can induce the rule that ""zup"" correlates directly to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Analyzing the given examples, we can see that each instance of the nonce word ""bluf"" is consistently translated to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Here are how the examples break down:

Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
Output: red yellow yellow red green
- ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""yellow"" in the output.

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
- ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""yellow"" following ""zup"".

Input: wif lug bluf wif zup
Output: red blue blue red yellow
- ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""blue"", which appears to be a translation error based on the consistent results of the other examples.

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red
- Similarly, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red"" which continues the apparent inconsistency.

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
- ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""yellow"" again.

There are inconsistencies in the third and fourth input-output pairs. However, if we ignore these inconsistencies and focus on the clear matches from other examples, then we can deduce the meaning assigned to the nonce word ""bluf"" as ""yellow"".

Rule: bluf -> yellow
Analyzing the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" is associated with the repetition of the color assigned to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" Here's the breakdown:

1. ""wif walm"" becomes ""red red red"" - ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""walm"" leads to two more ""red.""
2. ""lug walm"" becomes ""blue blue blue"" - ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" leads to two more ""blue.""
3. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" becomes ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red"" - ""zup"" is yellow, ""lug"" is blue, and ""walm"" follows another ""zup,"" resulting in two more ""yellow."" ""wif"" is red, leading to a double ""red"" again with ""walm.""
4. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" becomes ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"" - again, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" leading to two more ""yellow.""

From these examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately before it twice. So, if we were to express ""walm"" as a rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm
    ",Output: green green green,green green green,True,90
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. 

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color green in the output across all examples.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following correlations:

- Every instance of ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it always corresponds to ""red red.""
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" both when it follows ""wif"" and when it stands alone.
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" both when it follows ""wif"" and when it stands alone.

Putting these observations together, it seems that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of the context. Therefore:

wif -> ""red""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word zup translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Given the examples provided:

1. zup lug zup lug zup bluf -> yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
2. wif bluf -> red red
3. zup lug bluf -> yellow blue blue
4. lug bluf dax bluf -> blue blue green green
5. wif bluf -> red red

From (1), (3), and (4), we can deduce:

- When the nonce word precedes ""bluf,"" its output color is doubled.
  - ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow, when followed by ""bluf,"" results in yellow yellow.
  - ""lug"" which corresponds to blue, when followed by ""bluf,"" results in blue blue.
  - ""dax"" which corresponds to green, when followed by ""bluf,"" results in green green.

From (2) and (5), we encounter ""wif bluf"" in both instances providing the output ""red red,"" which supports the pattern identified.

Therefore, we can determine the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" as follows:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word preceding ""bluf"". If ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the color yellow is repeated; if it follows ""lug,"" the color blue is repeated; if it follows ""dax,"" the color green is repeated; if it follows ""wif,"" the color red is repeated.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" affects the color output of the subsequent words until a new word appears that changes the pattern. To determine the precise rule, let's match each occurrence of ""walm"" in the input with the corresponding output pattern:

1. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red
   - After ""walm,"" the output becomes ""green"" repeatedly until ""wif"" changes it to ""red.""

2. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   - After ""walm,"" the output is ""red"" until ""dax"" changes it to ""green"" and then ""zup"" changes it to ""yellow.""

3. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   - ""Walm"" occurs at the end, and the output is ""red"" repeatedly after it, which was the last color before ""walm.""

4. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - After ""walm,"" the output is ""blue"" repeatedly, which was the color for ""lug.""

5. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
   - After ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow"" repeatedly until ""dax"" changes it to ""green,"" and then ""wif"" changes it to ""red.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, it causes the output to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it until a new word changes the pattern.

Therefore, we can state the meaning of ""walm"" as follows:

walm -> Causes the repetition of the last color until the pattern is changed by a subsequent word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow blue,yellow yellow blue,True,91
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the meaning of the word ""lug"" by comparing inputs to outputs. We start by analyzing each instance of ""lug"" in the examples and their corresponding outputs:

Example 1: lug walm zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow red
Example 2: lug bluf -> blue blue
Example 3: lug walm -> blue blue blue
Example 4: zup bluf lug -> yellow yellow blue
Example 5: zup lug wif dax lug -> yellow blue red green blue

From these examples, it's evident that every occurrence of ""lug"" corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output. As ""lug"" is not followed by any modifiers or conditions that change its corresponding output, we can conclude that ""lug"" simply translates to the word ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The term ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in all provided examples, regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other terms.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" Here are the observations that lead to this conclusion:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, irrespective of its position, the output always contains ""red.""
- The output ""red"" is not associated with any other input than ""wif.""
- The occurrence of ""wif"" does not seem to affect the colors associated with other words; ""dax"" is always green, and so on.

Therefore, based on these examples, we can deduce the following rule:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to find a pattern in the given examples. By looking at the input and corresponding output, we can infer the meaning of ""zup"":

- In the first example, ""zup wif dax walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red green green green blue."" Here, ""zup"" appears before ""wif"" which is translated as ""red.""

- In the second example, ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow."" Here, ""zup"" is at the end, and it follows ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

- In the third example, ""zup dax wif zup"" translates to ""yellow green red yellow."" Here, ""zup"" appears both at the beginning and the end, both times translating to ""yellow.""

- In the fourth example, ""zup lug"" translates to ""yellow blue."" Here, ""zup"" is followed by ""lug,"" which is translated to ""blue.""

- In the fifth example, ""lug walm zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow red."" Here, ""zup"" appears before ""wif"" and after ""walm,"" resulting in the translation ""yellow.""

From these examples, we can see that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow,"" regardless of its position or neighboring words. So, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's break down each example and see if we can identify a pattern:

1. zup bluf wif bluf -> yellow yellow red red
   It seems that ""zup"" corresponds to the first ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" Based on this, ""bluf"" appears to correspond to the second ""yellow"" and the second ""red.""

2. dax zup lug bluf -> green yellow blue blue
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" Since the last word is ""bluf,"" and the output is ""blue,"" we might think ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" here.

3. dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow
   Again, ""dax"" relates to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The output associated with ""bluf"" is ""green,"" which is the same as the color for ""dax.""

4. lug dax bluf wif dax -> blue green green red green
   ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red."" The output for ""bluf"" is green, which is the same as ""dax,"" similar to previous observation.

5. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green
   ""Dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red."" There's a new word here, ""walm,"" which seems to correspond to ""blue."" The ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" which is the same as ""wif.""

Based on these examples, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes on the color of the word that immediately follows it. If ""bluf"" is the last word, then it takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Here's how the rule holds up in the examples:

- In the first example, each ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word following it: red (from ""wif"").
- In the second example, ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word following it: blue (there's no word after ""bluf"" so it takes the color of ""lug"").
- In the third example, ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word following it: green (from ""dax"").
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word following it: green (from ""dax"").
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word right before it, because ""bluf"" is at the end: red (from ""wif"").

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> takes on the color of the word immediately following it; if it is the last word, it takes on the color of the word immediately before it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the given examples, let's attempt to identify a pattern based on the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

1. lug walm -> blue blue blue
2. zup dax walm lug wif -> yellow green green green blue red
3. lug walm wif zup wif -> blue blue blue red yellow red
4. dax wif walm -> green red red red
5. wif walm zup lug zup walm -> red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Notice that every time ""walm"" appears, it produces a sequence of the same color word in the output. Specifically, it seems to produce three repetitions of the color word that follows it:

1. walm -> blue blue blue
2. walm -> green green green
3. walm -> blue blue blue
4. walm -> red red red
5. walm -> red red red and yellow yellow yellow (as there are two occurrences of ""walm"")

Another observation is that ""walm"" does not seem to affect the color words before it, suggesting that its effect is not retroactive but only applies to the words that follow.

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" indicates the repetition of the next color word three times in the output. If ""walm"" appears more than once, each occurrence triggers the repetition for the next immediate color word in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug walm dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" seems to correspond to the color ""green"". Each time ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, ""green"" is present in the corresponding position in the output. 

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" translates to a specific output color, which is consistent across all instances. Examining each example:

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: wif
Output: red
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: wif
Output: red
- ""wif"" corresponds again to ""red""

Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds again to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds again to ""blue""

Rule:
wif -> red
Rule: zup -> ""yellow""

Every time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output at the same position. This consistency suggests that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".
bluf -> repeats the color word that precedes it.

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" appears after a color word, it repeats that color word. For example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"" because ""lug"" means blue, and ""bluf"" repeats the color word that comes directly before it.
Based on the provided examples, we can observe the following patterns:

1. When 'walm' follows 'dax', the output is a sequence of three greens (""green green green"").
2. When 'walm' follows 'lug', the output is a sequence of three blues (""blue blue blue"").
3. When 'walm' is used in other contexts, it appears to add three instances of the color associated with the word prior to it into the output sequence. For example:
   - After 'zup' (""yellow""), the output includes three yellows (""yellow yellow yellow"").
   - After 'wif' (""red""), the output includes three reds (""red red red"").

Given these observations, 'walm' seems to be a function that means ""repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.""

Rule: walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" in the input corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be as follows:

1. The word ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
2. The word ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" if it follows ""wif,"" and ""green"" if it follows ""dax.""
3. The word ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
4. The word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
5. The word ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

When considering the context in which ""dax"" appears, it consistently translates to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence of words.

Hence, the rule for ""dax"" is as follows:

dax -> green. 

Rule: The word ""dax"" always translates to the color ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" Each instance of ""wif"" translates to ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input string.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given input and output pairs, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"". Each time ""zup"" is presented in the input, the corresponding output includes the word ""yellow"" in the same position.

Here's the breakdown of the example translations with ""zup"" identified:

1. lug zup lug -> blue yellow blue
2. zup wif -> yellow red
3. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
4. lug bluf wif lug bluf zup -> blue blue red blue blue yellow
5. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue"". Here is the reasoning:

In the first example, ""wif walm lug bluf"" produces the output ""red red red blue blue"". We don't have enough context from this alone to determine what ""bluf"" means, but in the second example, ""zup bluf dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow green blue"". The word ""bluf"" is associated with ""blue"" and it is consistent here.

In the third example, ""zup lug bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue"". We can see that both ""lug"" and ""bluf"" translate to ""blue"". This suggests that ""bluf"" indeed means ""blue"", as ""lug"" is repeated and gives the same color each time.

In the fourth example, ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" translates to ""green green red yellow blue"". In this sequence, ""bluf"" is associated with ""green"" in the output, but since we have established that ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" and ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"" in previous examples, it becomes clear that ""bluf"" has to represent ""blue"" to keep the association consistent.

In the last example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"". In this context, it seems like each word corresponds to a color being mentioned twice, so ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""bluf"" should be ""green"" here as well. However, based on previous instances where ""bluf"" was associated with the color ""blue"", it suggests that there was an error in the output, and ""bluf"" should actually produce ""blue blue"".

Given these analyses and assuming the last example contains an error or represents an exception, the rule seems to be:

bluf -> blue
Based on the given examples, the word 'walm' appears to have a rule where it repeats the color associated with the word that precedes it three times.

Here's the breakdown of what 'walm' does with each input:

1. Input: zup walm
   - 'zup' is associated with 'yellow'
   - Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - Rule: walm makes 'zup' repeat its associated color three times.

2. Input: dax walm
   - 'dax' is associated with 'green'
   - Output: green green green
   - Rule: walm makes 'dax' repeat its associated color three times.

3. Input: zup walm dax lug
   - 'zup' is associated with 'yellow'
   - 'dax' is associated with 'green'
   - 'lug' has an associated color 'blue' and isn't directly influenced by 'walm', as 'walm' has already acted on 'zup'.
   - Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
   - Rule: walm makes 'zup' repeat its associated color three times, and then the sequence continues with the colors associated with the following words.

4. & 5. Inputs: wif walm & wif walm
   - 'wif' is associated with 'red'
   - Output: red red red (for both examples)
   - Rule: walm makes 'wif' repeat its associated color three times.

Therefore, the meaning of 'walm' can be described as follows:

walm -> meaning: 'walm' is a word that, when following another word, causes that word's corresponding output to be repeated three times. If that output is a color, 'walm' makes it appear three times consecutively in the sequence.

Rule: When 'walm' follows a word, the associated color of that word is repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,94
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. 

Rule: Each unique word corresponds to a unique color, and ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" The word ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""walm"" to ""blue"" in the given examples. However, since ""lug"" also translates to ""blue,"" ""walm"" seems redundant when ""lug"" is present in the sequence. It could be that ""lug"" always precedes other colors to indicate its presence, meaning that it represents the color ""blue"" every time it appears.
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to induce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word 'dax.' We'll examine each example and look for patterns.

In the first example:
- Input: dax walm wif
- Output: green green green red

In the second example:
- Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
- Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

In the third example:
- Input: dax walm zup lug
- Output: green green green yellow blue

In the fourth example:
- Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
- Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow

In the fifth example:
- Input: dax
- Output: green

From the examples, we can notice that whenever 'dax' appears in the input, the word 'green' appears in the same position in the output, regardless of its position in the input string or the presence of other words. This consistency suggests that 'dax' directly translates to 'green' in the output, independent of the context it is used in.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" There are no examples that contradict this, and ""wif"" does not appear to change meaning based on position or context within the given sequences. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Here is a detailed breakdown:

- In the first example, ""wif zup lug wif"" translates to ""red yellow blue red"", indicating ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- In the second example, ""dax zup wif zup"" translates to ""green yellow red yellow"", further supporting that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- In the third example, ""lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"", and ""zup"" is again translated as ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup,"" is translated to ""yellow yellow red green red yellow,"" with both instances of ""zup"" resulting in ""yellow"".
- In the fifth example, ""dax lug zup"" becomes ""green blue yellow,"" consistent with the prior translations of ""zup"" to ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at the consistent relationship between the input and the output.

1. In the first example, ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green."" Here, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" meaning ""bluf"" is associated with ""red"" as well.

2. The second example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug,"" translates to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue."" In this case, ""bluf"" immediately precedes a ""lug,"" which results in the sequence ""yellow blue,"" indicating ""bluf"" could mean ""yellow"" in this context. However, ""zup"" also translates to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" Since ""wif"" is still ""red,"" ""bluf"" must represent a color that, when followed by ""blue,"" results in ""yellow blue,"" which is contradictory to the first example. Therefore, ""bluf"" likely does not translate directly to ""yellow.""

3. In the third example, ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red green red red."" In this example, ""bluf"" occurs after ""wif"" and before the sequence ends. The ""wif"" before ""bluf"" translates to ""red,"" and since the sequence ends with ""red red,"" it suggests that ""bluf"" again corresponds to the color ""red.""

4. The last two examples also correlate ""bluf"" with the color ""red,"" since the sequences start with ""wif bluf"" and lead to ""red red"" in the output.

By comparing the different cases, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" when it directly follows ""wif"" and precedes either another color or the end of the sequence. Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" when it is in proximity to ""wif.""

Rule: bluf -> red (when in proximity to ""wif"")
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's closely examine the correlation between the input and output in each example. The examples show that the word immediately preceding ""walm"" in the input corresponds to the color that is repeated three times in the output. We can break down each example:

1. ""dax walm wif walm"" corresponds to ""green green green red red red."" Here, ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" and ""wif"" correlates with ""red."" ""Walm"" appears to trigger the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.
   
2. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" The presence of ""walm"" after ""zup"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated.

3. ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green,"" once again indicating ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" and ""walm"" triggers the repetition.

4. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" corresponds to ""blue red yellow red red red."" The last color before ""walm"" is ""red"" associated with ""wif,"" and it is repeated three times after ""walm.""

5. The repetition of ""dax walm"" yielding ""green green green"" reinforces the pattern.

From these observations, the meaning of ""walm"" appears to be a rule that triggers the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately before it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif walm dax
    ",Output: red red red green,red red red green,True,95
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears, it corresponds to the color ""blue.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word translates to a specific color. The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" The word ""walm"" is only present in one example, but based on that example, it seems to translate to a repetition of the color ""red"" three times. 

From this, the rule for ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" we must look at the output whenever ""wif"" appears in the input and compare it with the surrounding words to understand its translation or rule that applies to it.

From the examples:

1. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   Here, the word before ""wif"" is ""walm,"" and the word after is ""lug."" ""Walm"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

2. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
   ""Wif"" is the first word followed by ""dax"" and ""bluf,"" which correspond to ""green green."" Again ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

3. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   In this sequence, ""wif"" is at both the beginning and near the end. Both times ""wif"" is translated to ""red.""

4. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow
   ""Wif"" is followed by ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" itself is ""red.""

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   ""Wif"" is the first word followed by ""zup,"" and in the output ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

By examining the examples where ""wif"" appears, a consistent pattern shows that ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" regardless of its position or the surrounding words. It is independent of context.

Rule: wif -> red.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Explanation: Each example shows that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Regardless of the position of the word ""zup"" in a sequence, it always translates to ""yellow.""
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine the inputs and outputs, looking for patterns that could inform us about the rule governing ""bluf.""

- In the first example, ""dax bluf zup"" turns into ""green green yellow."" The word ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" which is associated with ""green"" and before ""zup"" which is associated with ""yellow.""
  
- In the second example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" which is associated with ""yellow.""
  
- In the third example, ""lug bluf dax lug"" translates to ""blue blue green blue."" ""Bluf"" appears between ""lug"" (blue) and ""dax"" (green).
  
- In the fourth example, ""wif lug bluf"" corresponds to ""red blue blue."" Here ""bluf"" is after ""lug,"" which correlates with ""blue.""
  
- In the fifth example, ""zup wif bluf zup"" leads to ""yellow red red yellow."" ""Bluf"" is after ""wif"" (which results in ""red"").

When ""bluf"" is surrounded by or follows words that have been given a consistent color, the color for ""bluf"" seems to match the color immediately preceding it. However, if different colors precede and follow ""bluf,"" the rule might be different, such as in the first example where ""dax"" (green) is followed by ""zup"" (yellow), and ""bluf"" takes the color of ""dax"" (green).

Based on the data provided, the working rule can be:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. If the word preceding ""bluf"" has not been associated with a color, then a default rule may apply (not identifiable from the given examples).

Therefore, the meaning we can assign is:

bluf -> Takes on the color of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the provided input-output pairs and identify any patterns associated with the word ""walm"" and the corresponding output colors.

Here's a breakdown of where ""walm"" appears and what color it produces:

1. Example One:
   - Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   - Output: yellow green green green yellow red
   - ""walm"" following ""dax"" results in green.

2. Example Two:
   - Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   - Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""walm"" at the end of the sequence results in yellow.

3. Example Three:
   - Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   - Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   - The first ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" resulting in yellow. The second ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" resulting in red.

4. Example Four:
   - Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   - Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" resulting in blue.

5. Example Five:
   - Input: dax walm zup lug
   - Output: green green green yellow blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" resulting in green again.

The color change appears to depend not on ""walm"" itself, but on the word immediately before it:

- After ""lug"" -> blue
- After ""dax"" -> green
- After ""zup"" -> yellow
- After ""wif"" -> red

So the rule seems to be that ""walm"" takes the color of the output corresponding to the word just before it in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> Takes the color of the preceding word in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug wif zup bluf
    ",Output: red blue red yellow yellow,red blue red yellow yellow,True,96
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: When ""lug"" is mentioned on its own or with ""walm,"" it translates to the color blue. Specifically:

- When ""lug"" is input by itself, the output is ""blue.""
- When ""lug"" is used alongside ""walm,"" each instance of ""walm"" is also translated into ""blue.""
- The presence of ""lug"" preceding other words appears to dictate that those other words (""walm"" in the given examples) should be translated as ""blue"" until another nonce word is mentioned (as seen in the second input where ""dax"" changes the pattern and the output becomes ""green"").
dax -> green. 

Rule: The term ""dax"" consistently corresponds with the color green in the output, regardless of the position it appears in the input or the other words present.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" appears to be consistent across all cases. In each instance, the word ""wif"" is translated to the color ""red"". There is no indication that the meaning of ""wif"" changes depending on the context within these examples. 

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
Considering the examples provided and their corresponding outputs, we can try to induce the rule that governs the meaning of the nonce word ""zup."" To do this, we will look for patterns in the input and output pairs:

1. Input: lug zup bluf dax
   Output: blue yellow yellow green
   
   Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to an apparent misspelling of ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" The occurrence of ""zup"" precedes two instances of ""yellow.""

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

   ""Walm"" has no direct correspondence before, but ""zup"" is followed by three ""yellow.""

3. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue

   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" Again, ""zup"" is followed by three ""yellow.""

4. Input: dax wif zup dax
   Output: green red yellow green

   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" The occurrence of ""zup"" is followed by one ""yellow.""

5. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" Each instance of ""zup"" is followed by a variable number of ""yellow,"" with one occurrence before ""lug"" and one occurrence before ""wif.""

Based on the above patterns, it seems that ""zup"" consistently correlates with the color ""yellow"" in the output, but the number of times ""yellow"" is mentioned after ""zup"" appears to be variable and not directly deducible from the examples given. However, we do see that each occurrence of ""zup"" is followed by at least one ""yellow.""

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates into at least one occurrence of the word ""yellow"" in the output, with the exact number of occurrences not necessarily predictable based on the input alone.

zup -> at least one ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" is associated with a color. In each example, whenever the word ""bluf"" appears, the output is ""blue."" Therefore, the most straightforward rule that can be deduced is that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue.

Rule: bluf -> blue
walm -> meaning. 

Based on the given examples, ""walm"" seems to be a rule dependent on the context of the preceding word. Whenever ""walm"" appears after another word, the output is a series of colors, specifically, the color that corresponds to the word that comes before ""walm"", repeated three times if it is ""lug"", or otherwise repeated as many times as there are letters in the preceding word.

For example:
- ""zup lug walm"" results in ""yellow blue blue blue"" – ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and it is repeated three times after the word ""walm.""
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" – ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and since ""zup"" has three letters, ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" – ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and it is repeated three times.
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" results in ""yellow yellow red red red"" – ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and since ""wif"" has three letters, ""red"" is repeated three times.
- ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue"" – ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and it is repeated three times.

Rule: The word ""walm"" prompts the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. If the preceding word is ""lug,"" the color is always repeated three times. For any other word, the repetition is based on the number of letters in that word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each provided example.
Analyzing the examples provided, here are the associated outputs for each input containing the word ""dax"":

- dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
- zup dax -> yellow green
- lug dax -> blue green
- wif bluf lug dax wif -> red red blue green red
- dax walm -> green green green

From the given examples, we can deduce that ""dax"" always translates to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the context of the other words.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
Based on the given examples, the rule can be deduced as follows:

- Each input word corresponds to a color in the output.
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- The word ""bluf"" corresponds to red.
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- The word ""zup"" appears to be a transition word that produces the color yellow.

So, following the pattern from the inputs to the outputs, it appears that:

- ""wif"" -> red
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""bluf"" -> red (though this may be a typo since it's given the same color as ""wif"" in the second example)
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""zup"" -> yellow

Rule: zup -> yellow
Observing the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, we can try to decipher the meaning or rule behind the word ""bluf."" 

Looking at each usage of ""bluf"" and its output:

- In the first example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green."" Both ""dax"" and ""bluf"" result in ""green.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" and before ""lug,"" and both ""bluf"" and ""lug"" translate to ""red blue.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" appears a total of three times. We see ""bluf"" first after ""lug,"" translating to ""blue blue,"" again between ""zup"" and ""dax,"" translating to ""yellow yellow green,"" and lastly before ""wif walm,"" translating to ""green red red.""
- In the fourth example, we see ""bluf"" twice. It comes after ""wif,"" which results in ""red red,"" and appears before ""wif walm,"" resulting in ""green red red.""
- In the last example, ""bluf"" again comes after ""lug,"" and they translate to ""red blue blue.""

Based on these observations, we can infer that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word. Therefore, if ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which is green, then ""bluf"" means green. If ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which is blue, then ""bluf"" would be blue, and so on.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the word immediately before it.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the pattern of colors that follow it in each example:

- In the first example, ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" produces ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue"". The word ""walm"" is followed by a sequence of red red red and blue blue blue, indicating a possible repetition of three of the same color.
  
- In the second example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" confirming the rule of three of the same color following the word ""walm.""
  
- The third example, ""wif bluf dax walm,"" gives us ""red red green green green."" Again, ""walm"" is followed by three of the same color: green green green.
  
- In the fourth example, ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug,"" the output is ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" which shows ""walm"" followed by three yellows.
  
- Finally, the fifth example, ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax,"" results in ""green blue blue blue green red red green,"" and here ""walm"" is followed by blue blue blue.

Given these examples, we can deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm."" It seems that when ""walm"" is used, it is followed by three of the same color in the output. However, the specific color that is repeated three times appears to be dependent on the word that directly follows ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> meaning. Meaning: The word ""walm"" in the input causes the following word's associated color to be repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup dax
    ",Output: green yellow green,green yellow green,True,98
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green every time it appears. The context or position of ""dax"" doesn't seem to affect its meaning. Other words ""lug"" and ""wif"" correspond to the colors blue and red, respectively, and ""zup"" to yellow.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

dax -> green

Meaning that the word ""dax"" represents the color green regardless of its position or the context within the provided inputs.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is input, the output consistently includes the color ""yellow."" Additionally, from the given outputs, it does not seem that the position of ""zup"" in the list of input words affects its corresponding color. Thus, the meanings of other words, such as ""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" ""dax,"" and ""walm,"" seem to translate to ""red,"" ""blue,"" ""blue,"" ""green,"" and ""green"" respectively, regardless of their position relative to ""zup.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Observing the given examples, each time the word ""bluf"" occurs, it duplicates the preceding color's word. Here's how we can deduce the rule:

- In the first example ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" which means that ""bluf"" takes the color that ""wif"" represents, which is ""red.""
- In the second example ""wif dax zup bluf,"" the output is ""red green yellow yellow,"" hence ""bluf"" is duplicating ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow.""
- In the third example ""lug dax bluf wif dax,"" the output is ""blue green green red green,"" showing that ""bluf"" takes the color of ""dax"" (green) just before it.
- The fourth example ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" translates to ""red blue blue red yellow,"" so ""bluf"" is copying ""lug"" (blue).
- In the fifth example ""zup bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow,"" indicating again that ""bluf"" duplicates the color of ""zup"" (yellow).

Rule:
bluf -> Duplicates the color word that immediately precedes it.
To figure out the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the given examples and establish a correlation between the inputs and their corresponding outputs. We can start by comparing the inputs to their outputs and looking for consistent patterns related to the presence of the nonce word ""walm.""

Here are the examined examples with observations:

1. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   Observation: 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow,' 'walm' corresponds to three occurrences of 'red' (red red red), and 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'.

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Observation: 'zup' is followed by 'walm' and the output is three occurrences of 'yellow.' Given that 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow' from the first example, 'walm' here may represent the repetition of the color that comes before it.

3. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   Observation: Here 'zup' corresponds to the first 'yellow,' 'bluf' to the second 'yellow,' and 'wif' to the first 'red.' Since 'walm' follows 'wif ' and translates to two additional 'red' colors, it reinforces the idea that 'walm' is a repetition related to the color that precedes it. 

4. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue
   Observation: 'dax' corresponds to 'green,' 'zup' is 'yellow,' and 'lug' is 'blue.' Since 'walm' comes after 'dax' and results in two more 'green,' it again seems to dictate repetition of the previous color.

5. Input: lug wif zup wif walm
   Output: blue red yellow red red red
   Observation: 'lug' corresponds to 'blue,' 'wif' to 'red,' 'zup' to 'yellow,' and another occurrence of 'wif' again to 'red.' The appearance of 'walm' after 'wif' results in two more repetitions of 'red.'

Considering these observations, the rule that 'walm' seems to follow is that it indicates a repetition of the color expressed by the word that comes right before it, in the form of three consecutive repeats.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color denoted by the preceding word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm zup
    ",Output: blue blue blue yellow,blue blue blue yellow,True,99
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following:

- When ""lug"" appears alone, the output is ""blue"" (Examples 2 and 3).
- When ""wif"" appears alone with ""lug,"" the output adds ""red"" after ""blue"" (Example 1).
- When ""lug"" is followed by ""zup wif,"" the output is ""blue yellow red,"" suggesting that ""zup wif"" corresponds to ""yellow red"" (Example 5).
- When ""lug"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""bluf wif,"" the output is ""green blue blue red,"" where ""dax"" may correspond to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" potentially to another ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red"" (Example 4).

From this, we can infer that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Therefore:

lug -> meaning. Meaning: blue. Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the same position in the output.
Based on the examples given, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a color as follows:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- bluf -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow 
- walm -> yellow

It is noted that ""bluf"" and ""dax"" both output the color green. Every other word has a consistent one-to-one relationship with a color. Given this information, the rule appears to be:

Rule: Each nonce word represents a specific color, and the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green.
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""wif"" leads to the output of ""red"" in every instance where it appears. Following that pattern, I'll list each instance and its corresponding output:

- wif lug -> red blue
- wif bluf dax -> red red green
- wif bluf -> red red
- zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
- wif lug -> red blue

It appears that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red,"" and the other words in the input dictate the remaining colors in the output. Since each instance where ""wif"" appears alone it is followed by a ""red"" color output, and when it is combined with another word, those words account for the additional colors, we can deduce:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
The examples provided associate each nonce word with a color. Reviewing the outputs corresponding to each input, we can attempt to deduce the rule or meaning behind the word ""bluf."" Let's analyze each input-output pair:

1. ""dax bluf wif zup"" maps to ""green green red yellow"":
   Since ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" and ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" it appears that ""bluf"" maps to ""green"" when following ""dax.""

2. ""zup dax bluf"" maps to ""yellow green green"":
   Here, we again see that ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""bluf,"" following ""dax,"" is ""green.""

3. ""wif bluf"" maps to ""red red"":
   ""wif"" is consistently ""red,"" and here ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and is also ""red.""

4. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" maps to ""red red green green red red red blue red"":
   Observing the sequence, when ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" it is ""red,"" and when it follows ""dax,"" it is ""green."" ""Walm"" and ""lug"" correspond to ""red"" and ""blue"" respectively. 

5. ""lug bluf"" maps to ""blue blue"":
   Here ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" following ""lug"" is also ""blue.""

From these patterns, we can deduce that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it:

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the word that comes before it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" I'll analyze the examples provided and aim to identify patterns that govern the outputs:

1. zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red
2. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
3. lug zup dax walm -> blue yellow green green green
4. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue
5. dax wif walm -> green red red red

Each 'walm' is followed by a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word that immediately follows 'walm':

1. walm -> yellow (lug = yellow immediately after walm)
2. walm -> red (lug = red immediately after walm)
3. walm -> green (none immediately after, but 'lug' earlier corresponds to blue and 'dax' to green)
4. walm -> blue (none immediately after, but 'lug' corresponds to blue)
5. walm -> red (none immediately after, but 'wif' corresponds to red)

Rule: walm -> causes the color corresponding to the next word (if there is a next word) to be repeated. If 'walm' is the last word, it causes the color corresponding to the previous word to be repeated.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Here is the rule that I've induced:

Rule:
lug -> blue

Each instance of the word ""lug"" in the input results in the word ""blue"" in the output, regardless of what other words accompany it.
Rule: dax -> green

Each instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds with the color ""green."" Regardless of the word's position in an input sequence, it consistently maps to ""green"" in the output sequence. Other words present in the inputs, like ""lug"" and ""walm,"" may correspond to other colors, but the rule induction for the word ""dax"" is that it translates to ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
Based on the given examples, the patterns indicate that the word ""bluf"" directly repeats the color that was mentioned just before it. Here is the evidence supporting this conclusion:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and the output is ""blue,"" which repeats the color of ""lug.""
- In example 2, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" again and the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue"" once more.
- Example 3 has ""bluf"" following ""wif"" without any other words, and the output is ""red red,"" indicating that ""bluf"" simply repeats the prior color.
- In example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green,"" reinforcing the rule that ""bluf"" repeats the previous color.
- Finally, in example 5, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and has ""walm"" preceding it with no output color assigned for ""walm,"" and the output reaffirms that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word just before it, which is ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the word before it.
walm -> meaning: The word ""walm"" means ""repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it."" 

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color-associated word, it causes the output to repeat the corresponding color of the preceding word the number of times equal to the number of letters in the preceding color-associated word. 

For example:
- ""zup walm"" produced ""yellow yellow yellow"" since ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow,"" and ""zup"" has three letters, thus the color ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- ""zup wif walm"" produced ""yellow red red red"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""wif"" has three letters, therefore ""red"" is repeated three times after the ""yellow"" corresponding to ""zup.""
- ""lug zup walm lug"" produced ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" where ""zup"" is once again before ""walm,"" causing ""yellow"" to repeat three times between the two ""blue"" which correspond to ""lug.""
- ""lug zup dax walm"" resulted in ""blue yellow green green green,"" with ""dax"" preceding ""walm"" resulting in the color ""green"" being repeated three times since ""dax"" has three letters.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color blue regardless of its position in the sequence.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the given examples, every time the nonce word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" is included in the output, regardless of the other words around it. Therefore, the rule is that ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
Based on the examples, it appears that each word has an associated color. ""Wif"" consistently translates to ""red,"" no matter its position in the sequence. Therefore, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following patterns:

- The word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- The word ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
- The word ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- The word ""walm"" translates to ""yellow,"" but when it is repeated in the sequence, it maintains a repetition of ""yellow"" for each subsequent occurrence.
- The word ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" with repetition causing it to repeat the word ""blue"" for each subsequent occurrence.
- The word ""bluf"" translates to ""blue,"" but without the repetition effect seen in ""lug"" and ""walm.""

From these patterns, it's clear that the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" without influencing the repetition pattern of subsequent words. Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> ""yellow""
Analyzing the examples provided, the results suggest that the word ""bluf"" leads to the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word. Here is how we can determine this:

- ""zup bluf"" corresponds with ""yellow yellow"": ""zup"" means yellow, ""bluf"" repeats it.
- ""lug wif bluf"" corresponds with ""blue red red"": ""lug"" means blue, ""wif"" means red, ""bluf"" repeats the color red.
- ""lug bluf zup lug"" corresponds with ""blue blue yellow blue"": ""lug"" means blue, ""bluf"" repeats the color blue, ""zup"" means yellow, the next ""lug"" means blue.
- ""dax lug bluf"" corresponds with ""green blue blue"": ""dax"" means green, ""lug"" means blue, ""bluf"" repeats the color blue.
- ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" corresponds with ""blue red blue green green"": ""lug"" means blue, ""wif"" means red, the next ""lug"" means blue, ""dax"" means green, ""bluf"" repeats green.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the word before it.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to relate to the repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it.

Here's the analysis of each example:

1. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" results in ""green blue blue blue yellow red."" After ""lug,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times; since ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it suggests that ""walm"" caused the repetition of ""blue.""

2. ""zup walm wif"" has the output ""yellow yellow yellow red."" The color ""yellow"" is repeated three times following ""zup,"" which precedes the ""walm,"" again indicating repetition due to ""walm.""

3. ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green."" The color ""green"" is repeated three times, which further supports the idea that ""walm"" causes repetition of the preceding color.

4. & 5. For both inputs, ""wif walm,"" the output is ""red red red."" Here again, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and ""red"" is repeated.

Since the repetition effect of ""walm"" is consistent across all examples, it seems that the term implies repeating the color of the word before it.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Each occurrence of ""lug"" results in ""blue"" in the output.
Rule: dax -> green

The examples provided consistently show that when the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the same position in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently maps to the color ""red"" in the Output. Each example where ""wif"" appears, regardless of the other words around it, results in ""red"" in the corresponding position in the Output. 

Here's the breakdown:

- In the first Input, ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red,"" with ""wif"" corresponding to the second ""red.""
- In the second Input, ""wif lug dax"" translates to ""red blue green,"" with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red.""
- In the third Input, ""wif bluf lug"" translates to ""red red blue,"" with ""wif"" corresponding to the first ""red.""
- In the fourth Input, ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax"" translates to ""red red yellow red blue green,"" with the first ""wif"" corresponding to the first ""red,"" and the second ""wif"" appearing before ""lug dax"" which have consistently mapped to ""blue green"", confirming that ""wif"" again maps to ""red.""
- In the fifth Input, ""wif"" alone translates to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the context of other words around it. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce what ""bluf"" means by looking for patterns between the inputs and the outputs. Here's what we can observe from the given data:

1. In example 1, ""bluf"" follows after ""wif,"" and the output for ""wif"" is ""red."" The output for ""bluf"" is also ""red."" Also, in this sequence, ""bluf"" precedes ""dax,"" which has an output of ""green,"" the same as the output for the ""dax"" that follows ""bluf.""

2. In example 2, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" again, and the output is ""red"" again, consistent with example 1.

3. In example 3, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and the output gives ""blue,"" which matches the output for ""lug.""

4. In example 4, ""bluf"" occurs twice, once following ""dax"" and another time after ""zup,"" and each time the output for ""bluf"" matches the color corresponding to the word that precedes it (green after ""dax,"" yellow after ""zup"").

5. In example 5, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow,"" matching the output for ""zup.""

Drawing from these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word that immediately precedes it. Therefore, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> the color output corresponding to the word that comes immediately before ""bluf.""

Given this rule, if ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue""), the output is ""blue."" If ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (which corresponds to ""green""), the output is ""green,"" and so on.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" indicates repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it in the sequence. Following this pattern, when ""walm"" is used after a color word, the color word's corresponding color is outputted three times. Here is the analysis of the given examples:

- ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red"": ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated three times.
- ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue"": ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- ""zup wif lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"": ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red"": This is a repetition of the first example.
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green"": ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> A rule where the color word before ""walm"" gets repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" means blue in every context it appears within the examples provided. Regardless of the surrounding words (dax, zup, wif, bluf, walm), ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
Based on the examples provided, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the output. However, there is another pattern observed when the word ""wif"" is introduced between ""dax"" which leads to ""red"" in the sequence ""green red green.""

Here's the breakdown according to the given examples:

- ""dax zup"" -> ""green yellow"": ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""
- ""dax walm wif dax"" -> ""green green green red green"": We can assume ""walm"" translates to ""green,"" while the pattern ""dax wif dax"" translates to ""green red green.""
- ""lug dax"" -> ""blue green"": ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""
- ""dax"" -> ""green"": ""dax"" alone translates to ""green.""
- ""dax wif dax"" -> ""green red green"": The pattern ""dax wif dax"" results in ""green red green"" with ""wif"" seemingly causing ""red"" to appear between two greens.

Rule:
- dax -> green
- Whenever ""dax"" is followed by ""wif"" and another ""dax,"" there's a ""red"" in between the ""green"" outputs.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
From the given examples, we can try to induce the rule that determines what zup means in contrast to the other words.

- In all occurrences of ""zup"", the output always contains ""yellow"".
- ""zup"" appears before ""wif"" twice and both times the sequence translates to ""yellow red"". 
- ""zup dax wif"" translates to ""yellow green red"", and since we know ""wif"" translates to ""red"", it suggests that ""dax"" translates to ""green"".
- ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" gives us ""green green red yellow green"". The sequence ""bluf"" seems to translate to ""green"" as well, ""wif"" again to ""red"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and finally ""dax"" to ""green"" once more.
- ""lug zup dax lug dax"" translates to ""blue yellow green blue green"". By this point, ""lug"" seems to be consistently translating to ""blue"", confirming that ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"".

Based on these observations, we can deduce:

Rule: zup -> yellow

So, ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".
To deduce the meaning or rule of ""bluf"" let's look at the inputs and outputs given, paying special attention to repetitions and variations:

1. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
2. ""wif zup bluf"" -> ""red yellow yellow""
3. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""
4. ""zup bluf lug zup"" -> ""yellow yellow blue yellow""
5. ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" -> ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue""

Looking at the patterns, we can make several observations:

- Whenever ""bluf"" occurs after ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- ""bluf"" appears directly after ""wif"" twice, the output is ""red red"" in one instance and ""red yellow yellow"" in the other, suggesting ""bluf"" could be repeat of the prior color.
- In the phrase ""zup dax bluf,"" the output is ""yellow green green,"" again indicating that ""bluf"" could represent a repetition because ""green"" corresponds to ""dax"" and is repeated after ""bluf.""

Given these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" represents a repetition of the color word output that directly precedes it.

Therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" is:
bluf -> repeat the previous color word in the output.
To figure out the meaning or rule for ""walm"", let's look at how the word ""walm"" affects the output in each provided example:

1. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red
   - Here ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" resulting in double green.
   
2. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   - The first ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and again turns ""wif"" to blue (green after ""lug""). The second ""walm"" makes additional ""red"" duplicates after ""wif"".
   
3. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   - Here ""walm"" comes after ""wif"" and it seems that it duplicates the output color for ""wif"", which is red.
   
4. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   - Again, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and seems to duplicate the ""red"".
   
5. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue
   - Once more ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and it duplicates the ""blue"" before changing the next color to red.

Based on the patterns above, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word that comes before it at least once, then influences the following word. Here are the rules that can be drawn:

- When ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" (blue), the next word is ""wif"" (ordinarily red), but it becomes blue and then resumes its original color for the following iterations.
- When ""walm"" comes after ""wif"" (red), the next words are duplicates of red and do not change until a new word without ""walm"" appears.

Rule: walm -> duplicates the output color of the word that precedes it, and seems to affect the color of the following word if that following word is ""wif"" (forces ""wif"" to take on the color of the preceding word rather than its own usual color).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif bluf
    ",Output: green red green green,green red red,False,104
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Based on the provided examples, every instance of ""lug"" corresponds directly to the output ""blue,"" regardless of the position of ""lug"" in the input sequence or the presence of other words. 

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""
Based on the given examples, the following mappings can be observed:

- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> green
- wif -> red

The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence. From the information provided:

- ""lug zup dax walm"" outputs ""blue yellow green green green,"" which indicates that ""walm,"" like ""dax,"" means ""green.""
- ""zup dax lug"" outputs ""yellow green blue,"" supporting the translations above for ""zup"" and ""lug.""
- ""lug dax"" outputs ""blue green,"" further corroborating that ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""dax"" is ""green.""
- ""dax zup"" outputs ""green yellow,"" which again supports that ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow.""
- ""zup dax lug wif dax"" outputs ""yellow green blue red green,"" where the only new word is ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red"" in the output. ""Dax"" is used twice and corresponds to ""green"" both times.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples:

1. Whenever the word ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red.""
2. Other words such as ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" and ""zup"" are associated with different colors: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Given that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
The provided examples show a consistent pattern in which the nonce word ""zup"" is always followed by distinct outputs in terms of color. There is a rule that can be drawn by looking at each instance where ""zup"" appears:

- In the first example, ""dax zup dax walm"" translates to ""green yellow green green green"". ""Zup"" appears after ""dax"" and before another ""dax"", and the output is ""yellow"".
- In the second example, ""lug zup bluf dax"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow green"". ""Zup"" appears after ""lug"" and before ""bluf"", and the output is ""yellow"".
- In the third example, ""lug dax zup dax wif"" translates to ""blue green yellow green red"". ""Zup"" occurs after ""dax"" and before another ""dax"", with the output being ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""wif zup dax bluf"" translates to ""red yellow green green"". ""Zup"" appears after ""wif"" and before ""dax"", and the output is ""yellow"".
- In the last example, ""zup lug wif"" translates to ""yellow blue red"". ""Zup"" occurs at the beginning, and the associated output is ""yellow"".

Based on these examples, it is observed that regardless of the words that come before or after ""zup"", the output associated with ""zup"" is always ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the inputs and their corresponding outputs to find patterns.

1. In the first example, the output sequence is ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" and we see that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" appears to correspond to ""blue.""

2. In the second example, ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" again is output as ""blue.""

3. In the third example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" to ""green.""

4. In the fourth example, it's the same as in the second example: ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""bluf"" is ""blue.""

5. In the fifth example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" to ""green.""

Upon reviewing these examples, it appears that ""bluf"" directly corresponds to the color that precedes it. In cases where ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" it is ""blue,"" and where it follows ""dax,"" it is ""green."" Hence, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it when that word corresponds to a color.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word that corresponds to a color.
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the rule for the nonce word ""walm."" Here is the analysis:

- In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the output is ""red blue."" Since ""lug"" on its own translates to ""blue,"" ""walm"" must correspond to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" which yields ""green red."" We know that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""walm"" must correspond to ""green.""
- In the third and fourth examples, the repeated sequence ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue."" Since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" here also must correspond to ""blue.""
- In the final example ""walm"" occurs in the middle of the sequence and at the end corresponds to ""yellow,"" since the beginning and ending colors are associated with ""zup"" and ""dax"" respectively, while the ""walm"" in the middle is followed by ""dax,"" leading to ""yellow green.""

The consistency in all the examples is that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" acts as a mimic or placeholder for the color of the previous word. If there is no previous color word, it defaults to the next color word following it.

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the preceding word in the sequence. If there is no preceding word, defaults to the color of the following word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm
    ",Output: yellow yellow,yellow yellow yellow,False,105
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each instance, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the context.
dax -> green

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green"". It does not matter what other words are around it or what the order is; ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"".
Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the rule by looking at the correspondence between the input and output sequences:

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" is repeated three times and corresponds to ""blue"" each time

Input: zup dax walm lug wif
Output: yellow green green green blue red
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" at the end

Input: lug dax wif
Output: blue green red
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" at the end

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: wif
Output: red
- ""wif"" alone corresponds to ""red""

From these examples, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow.""
bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" in the input corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the consistent patterns of the inputs and outputs:

1. Input: zup lug walm wif walm | Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
   - ""wif"" changes the next output color to red, it occurs once but results in three reds.

2. Input: dax walm wif | Output: green green green red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green.
   - The pattern after ""walm"" continues with the color green before changing to red, due to ""wif"".

3. Input: dax zup dax walm | Output: green yellow green green green
   - This set reinforces that ""dax"" corresponds to green and that ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
   - ""walm"" is followed by greens, so it seems to repeat the last color mentioned before it.

4. Input: lug walm wif lug | Output: blue blue blue red blue
   - This set reinforces that ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
   - Again, ""walm"" is followed by blue, repeating the last mentioned color before turning red due to ""wif"".
   - Finally, another ""lug"" produces another blue.

5. Input: lug walm zup wif | Output: blue blue blue yellow red
   - Similar to the previous examples, ""lug"" produces blue, ""zup"" yellow, and ""wif"" red.
   - ""walm"" once again is followed by repeating the color that precedes it before the color changes.

Based on the pattern from the examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the last color mentioned before it.

Rule: walm -> repeats the last mentioned color until a color change is indicated by another word, such as ""wif"" which changes the sequence to red.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,106
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. 

Based on the given examples, every time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding output. Therefore, the rule is that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" means ""blue"".
Based on the examples provided, each instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds directly to the word ""green"" in the output. This suggests that ""dax"" means ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> meaning. Rule:

Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" seems to correspond to the color ""red."" Every time the word ""wif"" is presented in the input, the color ""red"" is part of the output. Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" can be translated to the color ""red.""

If the second word in the input is ""lug"" (as seen in the first examples), the output is ""red blue."" However, without additional context or examples for the word ""lug,"" we cannot determine with certainty what ""lug"" translates to. We could hypothesize that ""lug"" might mean ""blue,"" but without further evidence, this is not a conclusive rule.

For the input containing ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red,"" which might suggest ""bluf"" correlates with ""red,"" but again, due to the limited data, we cannot establish a definitive rule for ""bluf.""

Lastly, in the case of the input ""zup wif,"" the output ""yellow red"" indicates that ""zup"" might translate to ""yellow."" However, we would need additional data points to corroborate this rule.

In summary, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow. Rule: When ""zup"" is present in the input, the word ""yellow"" is outputted. When other nonce words follow ""zup,"" they correspond to additional color outputs (e.g., ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" and ""bluf"" both correspond to ""blue"").
Analyzing the given examples and their corresponding outputs, it seems that the word ""bluf"" directly echoes the color associated with the word that precedes it. Here is how the rule applies to each example:

- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"": ""bluf"" echoes the color associated with ""zup,"" which is yellow.
- ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" -> ""green green red yellow red"": ""bluf"" echoes the color associated with ""dax,"" which is green.
- ""zup dax bluf"" -> ""yellow green green"": ""bluf"" echoes the color associated with ""dax,"" which is green.
- ""lug dax bluf wif dax"" -> ""blue green green red green"": ""bluf"" echoes the color associated with ""dax,"" which is green.
- ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue"": ""bluf"" echoes the color associated with ""lug,"" which is blue.

Rule: bluf -> the color that matches the word immediately preceding it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" I will correlate the outputs associated with occurrences of ""walm"" in the inputs:

1. dax zup walm wif walm -> yellow appears twice after ""walm"", signifying that it may result in ""red red red"" (since ""dax"" and ""zup"" correlate with ""green"" and ""yellow"" earlier in the output).
2. dax wif walm -> ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and is again associated with ""red red red.""
3. wif lug dax walm -> ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green green green.""
4. lug walm wif lug bluf -> ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the output is a single ""blue"" before it reverts to the pattern associated with ""wif lug bluf.""
5. zup walm dax lug -> ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and is followed by ""green blue,"" which corresponds to ""dax lug.""

Given these outputs, it appears that ""walm"" causes a repetition in the output color of the previously mentioned input word.

Now, let's apply the rule to each example:
1. ""dax zup walm wif walm"" -> ""dax"" triggers green, ""zup"" triggers yellow, ""walm"" should repeat the color triggered by ""zup"" which is yellow, ""wif"" triggers red, and the last ""walm"" should repeat red, hence ""yellow yellow red red red.""
2. ""dax wif walm"" -> ""dax"" triggers green, ""wif"" triggers red, ""walm"" should repeat red, hence ""red red red.""
3. ""wif lug dax walm"" -> ""wif"" triggers red, ""lug"" triggers blue, ""dax"" triggers green, and ""walm"" should repeat green, hence ""green green green.""
4. ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" -> ""lug"" triggers blue, ""walm"" should repeat the color for ""lug"" which is blue, followed by the sequence of ""wif lug bluf"" which gives the sequence ""red blue blue.""
5. ""zup walm dax lug"" -> ""zup"" triggers yellow, ""walm"" should repeat the yellow color, ""dax"" triggers green, and ""lug"" triggers blue.

The rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the input word immediately before it to repeat. Based on this deduction, we can write the rule for ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: walm -> Causes the color of the output immediately preceding it to repeat.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
Based on the given examples, the rule for the use of the word ""dax"" seems to be that it translates to the color ""green."" Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. The other words each have their own color associations as well, and these do not change regardless of position or repetition. 

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output. Here are the examples and their translations:

- lug dax lug wif -> blue green blue red
- wif -> red
- dax walm wif walm zup -> green green green red red red yellow
- zup wif bluf zup -> yellow red red yellow
- wif zup -> red yellow

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, where 'zup' consistently results in the output 'yellow', the rule seems to be that the nonce word 'zup' means 'yellow'. 

Rule: zup = yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look at the commonalities between all examples provided. To start with, let's look for a pattern relating to the word ""bluf"" and the output colors:

1. wif **bluf** dax -> red **red** green
2. dax **bluf** wif zup wif -> green **green** red yellow red
3. dax zup **bluf** -> green yellow **yellow**
4. dax **bluf** wif -> green **green** red
5. wif lug **bluf** zup **bluf** dax -> red blue **blue** yellow **yellow** green

In views of the examples above, we can assert the following about ""bluf"":

- In example 1, the word ""bluf"" triggers an output color that matches the color output of the word right in front of it (""wif"" -> red, ""bluf"" -> red).
- Example 2 also shows ""bluf"" taking the color of the word right before it (dax -> green, bluf -> green).
- Again in example 3, ""bluf"" takes on the color of ""zup"" which precedes it.
- Example 4 supports the same rule as before.
- Example 5 is crucial because ""bluf"" occurs twice and adopts the color of the preceding words which are different (""lug"" -> blue, ""bluf"" -> blue; ""zup"" -> yellow, ""bluf"" -> yellow).

From the pattern, we can induce that ""bluf"" changes its meaning according to the context, more specifically, it takes on the meaning (or in this case, the color) of the word immediately preceding it. Hence, we can formulate the rule that:

Rule: bluf -> takes the meaning or attribute (color in this context) of the word directly preceding it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns between inputs and their corresponding outputs by focusing on the occurrences of ""walm"" and their relationships with the other words and colors.

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
- ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" and ""zup,"" with the outputs ""green"" and ""yellow,"" respectively.
- ""wif"" has a constant output of ""red.""

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""walm"" immediately follows ""zup"" with the same output color ""yellow.""
- This input does not provide a discernible differentiation for ""walm"" because ""yellow"" could be the output for ""zup"" without additional context.

Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
- Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" and ""lug,"" with output colors ""blue"" for both.
- This suggests that ""walm"" depends on the word that follows it, at least in this context.

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
- This is the same as the first input, so no new information is provided here.

Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green
- Here ""wif"" and ""lug"" both precede ""dax"" and ""walm,"" with ""dax"" and ""walm"" sharing the same output color ""green.""

Now, let's form a hypothesis: ""walm"" repeats the color output of the word that follows it. This hypothesis is consistent with examples 1, 3, and 5. Example 2 doesn't invalidate the hypothesis because ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and both have the same output color.

Rule: walm -> the color output of the word following it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,108
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples given, we can infer a pattern for the meaning of ""lug"" as well as the other nonce words (""zup,"" ""dax,"" ""bluf,"" and ""wif""). It appears that each of these words translates to a specific color.

Here's what we can deduce from the examples:

- Whenever lug appears, the output is ""blue.""
- For zup, the output is ""yellow"" when it precedes other nonce words.
- For dax, the output is ""green"" when it precedes other nonce words.
- For bluf, the output is ""blue"" when it precedes other nonce words.
- For wif, the output is ""red"" when it follows other nonce words.

It seems that each nonce word consistently translates to the same color regardless of their position in the sequence, with the exception that wif always translates to ""red"" when it follows other words.

Therefore, the rule is:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"" in the output, regardless of the context it's used in. The words that precede ""dax"" in the examples (""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""zup"") each correlate to a different color (""red,"" ""blue,"" ""yellow"" respectively). Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""dax"" directly translates to the color ""green,"" independent of other words in the input.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position within a sequence of words. Thus, the rule can be written as:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
bluf -> repeat the color word that directly precedes it.

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" follows a color word, it indicates that the color word should be repeated in the output.
To find the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look for patterns and consistencies in its usage and the corresponding output in the provided examples.

Let's analyze each instance:

1. lug walm wif lug -> blue blue blue red blue
2. zup bluf lug zup walm -> yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
3. dax walm zup lug walm -> green green green yellow blue blue blue
4. lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue
5. dax wif walm -> green red red red

The first thing to note is that ""walm"" appears to generate a varying number of blue outputs, except in the last example where the output is red. More precisely:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" which means ""walm"" following ""lug"" generates two additional blue outputs.
- ""zup walm"" results in a single yellow, indicating that in this context ""walm"" does not modify the output.
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green,"" which implies that ""walm"" following ""dax"" generates one additional green output.
- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red,"" showing that when ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it turns the output to red.

The patterns suggest that ""walm"" is dependent on the word preceding it, and modifies the output based on that word. Let's formalize that observation:

Rule:
- After ""lug,"" ""walm"" adds two more of the previous color, which is blue.
- After ""zup,"" ""walm"" does not add any new color outputs.
- After ""dax,"" ""walm"" adds one more of the previous color, which is green.
- After ""wif,"" ""walm"" changes the output to red and repeats it once.

Applying the rule consistently to the provided examples, we get the correct output sequences.

Thus, walm -> When following a color-indicating nonce word, ""walm"" repeats the corresponding color output either one or two more times depending on the preceding word, except when following ""wif"" where it changes the color output to red and repeats it once.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow blue blue blue,yellow yellow yellow blue,False,109
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" Here's the summary of the instances where ""lug"" was used:

- In the first example, ""lug"" is followed by ""zup walm,"" which translates to ""blue yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""lug"" is ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" stands alone or alongside other words, and each time it translates to ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""lug"" is between ""wif"" and ""dax,"" which translates to ""red blue green,"" again indicating that ""lug"" is ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" is the only input, and the output is ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" repeats and each instance translates to ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the word ""green"" regardless of context. The meaning of ""wif"" and ""walm"" in the second and fourth examples correspond to ""red"" and ""green green green"" respectively, but they do not affect the meaning of ""dax,"" which remains ""green"" in all cases.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" from the given examples, let's look at the output in each case:

1. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red
   
   The word ""wif"" appears at the end of the input, and ""red"" is the corresponding color in the output.

2. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   
   The word ""wif"" appears at the beginning of the input, and ""red"" is the first color in the output followed by ""blue,"" which repeats for the next two words.

3. Input: wif
   Output: red
   
   Here ""wif"" is the sole input, and ""red"" is the sole output.

4. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   
   ""Wif"" appears twice. When it first appears, it's followed by ""red"" in the output. When it appears the second time at the end, it's again followed by ""red.""

5. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red

   The appearance of ""wif"" is once again followed by ""red"" in the output.

From these examples, we can deduce that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" consistently in all provided examples.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to examine the pattern of how it's used in the examples and how it corresponds to the outputs.

In the first input ""dax bluf,"" the output is ""green green."" Since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output, this suggests that ""bluf"" might also correspond to ""green.""

In the second input ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red red"" in the output. The rest of the outputs (""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green"") seem to be paired with their respective inputs except for ""bluf.""

In the third input ""wif walm lug bluf,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue"" in the output. Here again, we see ""bluf"" being associated with a double color.

In the fourth input ""lug bluf dax lug,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue"" in the output. Just as before, ""bluf"" results in a doubled output of the color corresponding to the previous word.

In the fifth input ""dax zup bluf,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow"" in the output, creating a double of the color corresponding to ""zup"" which is ""yellow.""

Based on this analysis, it seems that ""bluf"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it to be repeated in the output. Therefore, ""bluf"" leads to the duplication of the color that represents the word right before it.

Rule: bluf -> causes the preceding word's corresponding color to be outputted twice.
Based on the examples given, it appears that the walm is associated with a sequence of the same color followed by that sequence's color dominating the given context. To understand this, let's break down each example:

1. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green.
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red.
   
   Here, the appearance of ""walm"" is followed by three instances of ""yellow,"" which is the color associated with ""zup"" (just prior to walm).

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - Again, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and results in three instances of ""yellow.""

3. Input: lug walm zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
   
   The appearance of ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in three ""blue,"" the color associated with ""lug.""

4. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to green, although used only once. But based on this example alone, ""bluf"" could be interpreted differently. It requires further examples to definitively determine its color.
   - ""walm"" following ""zup"" results in three ""yellow,"" which is the color for ""zup.""
   
5. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in three instances of ""blue,"" the color for ""lug.""

Rule:
Based on these observations, we conclude that ""walm"" triggers a triplet of the color that corresponds to the word that immediately precedes ""walm.""

Therefore, walm -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,110
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
From the examples provided, we can infer that each word maps to a specific color. Here's what we can deduce from each input-output pair:

1. ""lug wif"" -> ""blue red""
This indicates that ""lug"" could mean ""blue"" since ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red"" based on other examples.

2. ""zup dax lug dax"" -> ""yellow green blue green""
Again, ""lug"" appears before ""blue"" while ""zup"" and ""dax"" correspond to ""yellow"" and ""green"" respectively. This reinforces the idea that ""lug"" means ""blue"".

3. ""zup lug"" -> ""yellow blue""
Here ""zup"" is followed by ""lug"" which again results in ""yellow blue"", supporting the claim that ""lug"" means ""blue"".

4. ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax"" -> ""red red yellow red blue green""
In this sequence, ""lug"" appears before ""blue"" and after ""wif"" which has been established as ""red"". This continues to support the meaning of ""lug"" as ""blue"".

5. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" -> ""yellow red green green green blue""
Once again, ""lug"" comes before ""blue"" and none of the previous words (""zup"", ""wif"", ""dax"", ""walm"") have been associated with ""blue"" based on the previous patterns.

Rule: lug -> ""blue""
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we should look for patterns in the provided examples. Notice how ""dax"" corresponds to a certain color output in each example:

- ""wif dax zup"" -> ""red green yellow""
  Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

- ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""
  Considering the previous example, ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" ""Bluf"" and ""walm"" must both correspond to ""red"" and ""green"" respectively, with ""walm"" causing a repetition of ""green.""

- ""dax lug"" -> ""green blue""
  ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

- ""zup dax walm zup wif"" -> ""yellow green green green yellow red""
  Building on the previous examples, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to ""dax"" (green), ""wif"" is ""red.""

- ""wif dax wif lug wif"" -> ""red green red blue red""
  Keeping with the consistent translations so far, ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue.""

Considering these patterns, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence. 

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples given, it seems that the word ""wif"" is associated with the output ""red"". When ""wif"" appears in a series of inputs with other nonce words, those words are followed by their respective colors, with ""wif"" consistently translating to ""red"".

Here are the associations:
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" (could be coincidental as it appears only once with ""wif"")

Therefore, irrespective of its position, whether at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of an input string, ""wif"" leads to the output ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it (lug, dax, walm, bluf, wif), ""zup"" always corresponds to the color yellow in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to identify patterns associated with the appearance of ""bluf"" and its corresponding output in the given examples. Let's examine the outputs that coincide with each occurrence of ""bluf"":

1. red green red **red** yellow red
2. yellow blue red green **green** red
3. yellow yellow yellow blue **red** red
4. yellow blue yellow **yellow** blue
5. yellow **yellow**

It seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to different colors in the output in each instance it appears. To determine the rule, let's look at the words that immediately precede ""bluf"" in each input:

1. wif -> red 
2. dax -> green 
3. wif -> blue 
4. lug -> yellow
5. None (occurs at the beginning of the input)

Now let's find the correlation between these preceding words and their outputs to see if there is a pattern regarding the output for ""bluf"":

- When ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is red.
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is green.
- When ""lug"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is yellow.
- When ""bluf"" appears at the beginning, the output is also yellow.

The rule appears to be that ""bluf"" itself does not have a consistent output color, but rather the word before it affects the output color. However, there's not enough information to provide a rule based on the given examples alone since the word ""wif"" is indicated to produce both red and blue, and ""bluf"" appears at the beginning only once.

Therefore, based on the inconsistent and limited data, we can only hypothesize that ""bluf"" might mean to repeat the color of the word that precedes it. However, the hypothesis fails for the third example where ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" but the output is ""red red,"" so the general rule for ""bluf"" is uncertain with the given examples.

This analysis suggests that there might be other contributing contextual factors not captured in the examples given, or that there might be an error in the dataset. Therefore, we cannot establish a definitive rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" based on the given information.

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" is inconclusive based on the given examples.
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to affect the color following it, causing it to repeat. Here are the observations:

1. ""wif walm lug bluf"" translates to ""red red red blue blue"". ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and the ""lug"" that comes after ""walm"" is repeated.

2. ""zup dax walm zup wif"" yields ""yellow green green green yellow red"". ""Walm"" is followed by a repeated ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"".

3. ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" becomes ""green green green red blue green green green"". After the first ""walm"", the ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"" is not repeated, but after the second ""walm"", the existing ""green"" from ""dax"" is repeated.

4. ""zup walm dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green"". After ""walm"", ""zup"" is not repeated, but ""green"", the color corresponding to ""dax,"" is.

5. ""lug wif dax walm zup"" leads to ""blue red green green green yellow"". Here, ""green"" from ""dax"" is repeated after ""walm"".

According to these observations, ""walm"" causes the color output (in English) that immediately follows it to be repeated. However, in case ""walm"" is followed by a new nonce word, there seems to be no repetition (see example 3 and 4); instead, the color that represented the nonce word before ""walm"" is repeated (or in other words, the sequence maintains its color pattern).

Rule: ""walm"" causes the preceding color sequence to extend by repeating the color associated with the word that appears right after ""walm"" when that word has had a color assigned to it. If a new nonce word follows ""walm"", the existing color pattern continues.

Hence, the rule is:
walm -> Triggers a repetition of the previous color if the word following walm has been previously associated with a specific color. If not, it continues the color pattern that preceded walm.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif bluf zup lug wif
    ",Output: red red yellow blue red,red red yellow blue red,True,111
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color blue in every provided example.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in each given example.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
Based on the examples provided:

Input: zup lug -> Output: yellow blue
Input: dax zup wif bluf lug -> Output: green yellow red red blue
Input: lug wif zup wif -> Output: blue red yellow red
Input: zup -> Output: yellow
Input: dax wif dax zup bluf -> Output: green red green yellow yellow

From these examples, we can see that whenever the word ""zup"" appears, the word ""yellow"" is also present in the output. Therefore, by examining the input-output pairings, it can be deduced that ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in each instance. No matter where ""zup"" appears in the sequence, it consistently translates to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we will analyze its association with the corresponding output colors across the examples:

1. wif bluf dax -> red red green
2. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
3. wif bluf -> red red
4. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
5. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red

From examples (1) and (3), it seems that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red. We'll use this observation as a starting point.

If we look at examples (1), (2), and (3), ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and results in another red. This happens regardless of what word comes next (or even if no word comes next, as in example 3). Therefore, it seems that ""bluf"" has a consistent output of red when it follows ""wif.""

Now, let's inspect examples (4) and (5) to see how ""bluf"" behaves with ""dax"" and in a longer sequence:

In example (4), ""dax bluf zup"" yields green green yellow. We see ""dax"" at the beginning, which corresponds to green, and ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" also resulting in green, like in the first position of example (1). ""Zup"" in the third position corresponds to yellow.

In example (5), ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" results in green red yellow yellow red red red. Here, ""dax"" is green, ""wif"" is red, ""zup"" is yellow. But then, we have ""bluf wif,"" which outputs yellow red. Notice that here ""bluf"" does not output red as it did in examples (1) to (3) but instead outputs yellow. Next comes another ""wif,"" which once again is red, and ""walm"" which results in red, its first appearance in the examples.

Let us look at the pattern:
- ""bluf"" follows a color word: green (dax), red (wif), yellow (zup) and the output color corresponds to the color of the word that comes before ""bluf"": when after ""dax"" it is green, when after ""wif"" it is red.
- However, in example (5), ""bluf"" precedes ""wif"" and produces yellow, while ""wif,"" as established, produces red.

From the information given, it is challenging to deduce a perfect rule since we have only one example where ""bluf"" does not follow a color word. But with the limited data, we could hypothesize that ""bluf"" assumes the color of the preceding word except when followed by ""wif,"" in which case it might assume a default or different color (yellow in the solitary example).

Here's a proposed rule based on the limited examples:

Rule: ""bluf"" assumes the color of the word just before it, unless it is followed by ""wif,"" in which case it might assume the color yellow, but additional examples would be needed for a more robust rule.
In analyzing the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we observe the following patterns:

Input: ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" -> Output: ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue""
Here, the nonce word ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" and the corresponding colors are ""blue blue.""

Input: ""zup walm dax"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow yellow green""
Here, ""walm"" is precedes ""dax,"" and the corresponding colors are ""yellow green.""

Input: ""lug wif dax zup walm"" -> Output: ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow""
In this example, ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, preceded by ""zup,"" and we see ""yellow yellow"" as the corresponding colors.

Input: ""zup walm lug"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow yellow blue""
""Walm"" follows ""zup"" and is followed by ""lug,"" giving us ""yellow blue.""

Input: ""zup walm wif"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow yellow red""
Finally, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""wif,"" resulting in ""yellow red.""

Upon closer examination, the pattern becomes clear: the term ""walm"" corresponds directly to the color ""yellow"" whenever it appears. We can determine that in every instance of the provided examples, ""walm"" translates to the color ""yellow,"" and there is no contextual change that alters this translation within the given data.

Rule: walm -> yellow.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax zup lug dax bluf
    ",Output: blue green yellow blue green blue,blue green yellow blue green green,False,112
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Rule: dax -> green

Regardless of its position in the sequence, the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in the output.
Based on the provided examples, I can induce the following rules:

1. Whenever the word ""wif"" appears alone, the output is ""red"".
2. When the word ""wif"" is followed by ""lug"", the output is ""red blue"".
3. When the word ""wif"" is followed by ""lug bluf"", the output is ""red blue blue"".

From these observations, we can deduce the following meanings:

- ""wif"" by itself translates to ""red"".
- ""lug"" following ""wif"" translates to ""blue"".
- ""bluf"" also translates to ""blue"" when following ""wif lug"".

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""wif"" always translates to ""red"", and the additional words after ""wif"" translate to ""blue"", potentially corresponding to their position in the input sequence. However, it is important to note that this rule is based on limited examples. If ""wif"" appeared in different contexts not provided here, the meaning might require adjustment. 

Rule: wif -> ""red"", when followed by other words, subsequent words may have specific color translations.
Based on the given examples, the rule can be inferred as follows:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the color indicated by the word that precedes it. For instance:

- When ""dax"" (green) precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""green green"".
- When ""wif"" (red) precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""red red"".
- When ""lug"" (blue) precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""blue blue"".

Therefore, we can determine that ""bluf"" acts as a duplicator of the color associated with the word that comes right before it. If ""X"" represents any color word and ""Y"" the resulting color, then the rule seems to be:

bluf -> meaning. The meaning of bluf is to duplicate the color of the preceding word. Rule: If ""X"" is the color word and ""Y"" is the corresponding color, then ""X bluf"" results in ""Y Y"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to correlate with a repetition of the color that precedes it. To deduce its meaning:

In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and following ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green."" This suggests that ""walm"" could mean ""repeat the previous color three times.""

In the second example, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and following ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red."" Again, ""walm"" results in the previous color repeating three times.

In the third example, the sequence ""wif walm lug"" corresponds to ""red red red blue."" Here, ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times, and ""lug"" is blue separately, which is consistent with the previous pattern.

In the fourth example, ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow,"" and there is no color given after ""walm"" to disrupt the pattern, so ""walm"" again results in three repetitions of the preceding color.

In the final example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue blue red blue blue."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (which is blue) and causes it to repeat three times, while ""wif lug bluf"" follows its own pattern afterward.

Based on all these examples, the rule for the word ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color immediately before it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,113
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" seems to act as a delimiter or marker that determines the color translation for the words that follow it until another instance of ""wif"" appears. The pattern of translation suggests the following correspondences:

- ""dax"" translates to ""green"" when it follows ""wif""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" when it follows ""wif""
- ""walm"" translates to ""red"" when it follows ""wif""
- ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" both when it follows ""wif"" and by itself
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" when it follows ""wif""

However, the translation of ""walm"" in the third example (""wif dax"") is not given, which would have helped in confirming its standalone translation, but the consistent ""red"" for ""bluf"" and ""lug"" after ""wif"" hints at its standalone translation.

Hence, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""wif"" signals that specific words following it will be translated to specific colors according to a predetermined list until ""wif"" appears again.

Therefore:

wif -> signals color translation based on the preceding word rule.
From the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" by examining its consistent relationship to a particular output across the different inputs.

Analyzing the examples one by one, we have:

1. Input: ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" 
Output: ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
In this sequence, both instances of ""zup"" are followed by the output ""yellow."" 

2. Input: ""zup""
Output: ""yellow""
This example, with ""zup"" as the sole input, still gives the same output, ""yellow.""

3. Input: ""zup walm wif""
Output: ""yellow yellow yellow red""
Again, ""zup"" appears at the start and corresponds to ""yellow.""

4. Input: ""lug zup wif lug""
Output: ""blue yellow red blue""
Here ""zup"" is again followed by ""yellow.""

5. Input: ""zup""
Output: ""yellow""
Consistently, a single ""zup"" produces the output ""yellow.""

Given the consistency across examples, we can derive the following meaning for the nonce word ""zup"":

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word 'bluf' seems to correspond to the color 'red' in the Output. Whenever 'bluf' appears in the Input, 'red' appears in the Output at the corresponding position.

Therefore, the rule is:

bluf -> red.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the corresponding outputs for each instance where ""walm"" appears:

1. Input: ""zup wif walm"" -> Output: ""yellow red red red""
    The words ""zup"" and ""wif"" correlate respectively with ""yellow"" and ""red"". The appearance of ""walm"" then is followed by three ""red"".

2. Input: ""dax walm zup lug"" -> Output: ""green green green yellow blue""
    The words ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug"" correlate respectively with ""green,"" ""yellow,"" and ""blue"". ""Walm"" here is followed by three ""green"".

3. Input: ""zup wif dax walm"" -> Output: ""yellow red green green green""
    ""Zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""dax"" correlate respectively with ""yellow,"" ""red,"" and ""green."" After ""walm"" appears, there are three ""green"".

4. Input: ""zup lug walm wif dax"" -> Output: ""yellow blue blue blue red green""
    ""Zup,"" ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""dax"" correlate respectively with ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" ""red,"" and ""green."" After ""walm"" there are three ""blue.""

5. Input: ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow red red red""
    ""Zup"" and ""wif"" correlate respectively with ""yellow"" and ""red,"" while ""bluf"" correlates with ""yellow."" Following ""walm,"" there are again three instances of ""red.""

From these examples, we notice that ""walm"" consistently triggers a repetition of three of the same color that is designated by the word that immediately precedes ""walm."" This replication does not depend on ""walm"" being at the end of the sequence, as seen in example 4. It purely relies on the word right before it.

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the color corresponding to the word just before it to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup lug
    ",Output: green yellow blue,green yellow blue,True,114
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word lug consistently translates to the color blue, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following rules for the word ""dax"":

- When ""dax"" is by itself, the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is preceded by the word ""wif,"" the output before and after ""dax"" is ""red green."" It suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" remains ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" and then ""wif,"" we see an output of ""green green green red."" Since ""dax"" itself translates to ""green,"" ""walm"" translates to ""green,"" and ""wif"" remains ""red.""
- When ""dax"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output is ""blue green,"" indicating that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" still translates to ""green.""

Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" appears to be consistently producing the output ""green"" regardless of the preceding word. 

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"". The other words each correspond to a different color: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""bluf"" to ""yellow"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""walm"" appears to also correspond to ""blue"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be that each nonce word is directly associated with a specific color. Given this pattern, the meaning of ""wif"" in the context of these examples can be summarized as:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"". Each instance where ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the respective position in the output. 

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the color ""blue."" This is evident because each time ""bluf"" is mentioned in the input, it is directly translated to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""bluf"" within the sequence of words.

Rule: bluf -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" adds repetitions of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. The preceding word's color output is then repeated an additional number of times.

Let's analyze the examples:

1. ""lug dax walm"" gives us ""blue green green green"". The word ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green"", and after the introduction of ""walm"" we see two additional greens.

2. ""wif bluf dax walm"" gives us ""red red green green green"". The word ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the color ""green"" is repeated two additional times following its original occurrence.

3. ""dax walm zup lug"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue"". After ""dax"" and ""walm"" we see two additional greens, followed by the colors for ""zup"" and ""lug"".

4. ""dax walm wif bluf"" yields ""green green green red red"". Again, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" adding two additional greens, and ""wif bluf"" follows with their associated colors without further repetitions.

5. ""wif walm zup"" provides ""red red red yellow"". The word ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" resulting in two extra reds before the color for ""zup"".

These examples suggest the following rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the color output of that word is repeated two additional times.

Therefore, walm -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word two extra times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: In each instance, the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be a direct mapping from input words to color words in English as output. Each instance of the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Similarly, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, we can try to find a consistent pattern for the word ""wif"" and its corresponding output:

Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green
- ""wif"" occurs at the start and corresponds to ""red.""
- The outputs for ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and ""walm"" are consistent across examples.

Input: dax zup lug wif zup
Output: green yellow blue red yellow
- ""wif"" is before the last ""zup"" and corresponds to ""red.""

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow
- ""wif"" precedes ""zup,"" and the output is ""red.""

Input: lug dax walm wif
Output: blue green green green red
- ""wif"" occurs at the end and corresponds to ""red.""

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue
- ""wif"" precedes ""lug,"" and the output is ""red.""

Regardless of its position, whether at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of the input, ""wif"" always corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the output.
Rule: bluf -> repeats the color word that immediately precedes it. 

In each example, ""bluf"" follows a color word and the output repeats that color word. For instance, ""wif lug bluf"" translates to ""red blue blue"", with ""bluf"" taking on the value of ""blue"" which was the color word before it. Similarly, in ""lug dax bluf wif dax"", ""bluf"" is between ""dax"" and ""wif"" which correspond to colors ""green"" and ""red"", respectively, and ""bluf"" takes the value of ""green"", the color word immediately before it. This pattern is consistent across all examples provided.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the provided inputs and corresponding outputs. Let's analyze the examples given:

1. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green
2. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
3. zup wif lug zup walm -> yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
4. lug walm zup -> blue blue blue yellow
5. lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue

First, we notice that each nonce word in the input is associated with a specific color in the output:

- dax is associated with green
- zup is associated with yellow
- wif is associated with red
- lug is associated with blue
- bluf is associated with red

With this understanding, let's consider the outputs where ""walm"" is present:

1. Green, blue, **blue blue blue**, green, red, red, green
2. Yellow, red, **red red red**
3. Yellow, red, blue, yellow, **yellow yellow**
4. Blue, **blue blue**, yellow
5. Blue, yellow, **yellow yellow**, blue

We can observe that ""walm"" seems to be repeating the color preceding it multiple times. Let's see if this pattern holds when ""walm"" is used:

- In the first example, ""lug"" is blue, and after ""walm,"" we get three blues.
- In the second example, ""wif"" is red, and after ""walm,"" we get three reds.
- In the third and fifth examples, ""zup"" is yellow before ""walm,"" and after ""walm,"" we see the color yellow two times in the third example and one time in the fifth example.

It seems that ""walm"" repeats the preceding color, but the exact number of repetitions might be dependent on another factor. Let's consider the position of ""walm"":

- Whenever ""walm"" is at the second position, the preceding color is repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" is at the last position in the sequence, the preceding color is repeated once.
- If ""walm"" is in a middle position, the color seems to repeat as many times until a new nonce word breaks the sequence or the sequence ends.

So it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm."" The number of repetitions may be connected to the position of ""walm"" in the sequence or the presence of another word to interrupt the repetition.

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated an uncertain number of times, potentially until another color word appears or the sequence ends.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif
    ",Output: green red,green red,True,116
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided where the output color corresponds directly with an input word, we can establish the following word-color associations:

- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" must then correspond to ""blue""

Each instance of ""lug"" is paired with the color ""blue"" in the output regardless of its position or the words surrounding it. There is no indication that the meaning of ""lug"" depends on the context since it always corresponds to the same color. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""lug"" can be defined as:

Rule: lug -> ""blue""
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. When ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green"" for each occurrence of ""dax"". Other words in the input correspond to other colors, for example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". The outputs for these words match their respective colors for each occurrence.

Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" seems to be as follows:

Whenever ""wif"" occurs, the output is ""red"". Additionally, ""wif lug"" results in ""red blue"", indicating that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". This pattern is consistent across the examples, regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input string.

Rule: wif -> ""red""
Based on the given examples, each instance of ""zup"" produces the output ""yellow."" Taking into account that the other words consistently produce the same color (""lug"" always results in ""blue,"" ""wif"" always results in ""red,"" and ""dax"" always results in ""green""), it is rational to conclude that the nonce word ""zup"" directly translates to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> red

Rule: The color represented by the nonce word ""bluf"" is consistently translated to ""red"" in the given examples.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color that is associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here is a breakdown of how the rule appears to apply:

- In the first example, ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" leads to the repetition of blue twice.

- In the second example, ""lug wif dax zup walm"" translates to ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" results in the repetition of yellow two more times.

- In the third and fourth examples, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green."" Here, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" leads to the repetition of green twice.

- In the fifth example, ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue green red blue red."" The first occurrence of ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" which results in two additional instances of blue, while the second occurrence of ""lug"" is not followed by ""walm,"" thus not leading to a repetition.

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup walm dax lug zup
    ",Output: blue yellow yellow yellow green blue yellow,blue yellow yellow yellow green blue yellow,True,117
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: Whenever the nonce word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word 'dax' always translates to the color 'green', regardless of its position or the words around it. Other words seem to have their own color associations (lug -> blue, wif -> red, walm -> green) that translate independently of 'dax'.
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the output includes the color red.
Analyzing the examples provided, we can deduce the following translations for each word based on consistent patterns:

- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"".
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"".
- ""walm"" always follows ""lug"" and translates to an additional ""blue"".
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" when following ""wif"" or ""lug"".
- ""bluf"" only appears once after ""zup"" and translates to ""yellow"".

Let's now focus on the word ""zup"". This word appears in various contexts and consistently translates to ""yellow"", regardless of the position in the sequence or the words that come before or after it.

Here are the specific instances:
1. ""zup wif zup"" translates to ""yellow red yellow"", with ""zup"" translated to ""yellow"" at both the beginning and the end.
2. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" has ""zup"" as the first word, which translates to ""yellow"".
3. In ""lug dax zup lug wif"", ""zup"" is in the middle and translates to ""yellow"".
4. ""wif lug zup bluf"" has ""zup"" followed by ""bluf"" (which we've only seen once), and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".
5. ""lug walm zup lug walm"" has a single ""zup"" among ""lug"" and ""walm"" pairs, translating to ""yellow"".

Given this consistent translation, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look at each example and the corresponding output.

- In ""lug wif lug dax bluf,"" the output is ""blue red blue green green."" Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the final ""green.""
- In ""zup wif bluf,"" the output is ""yellow red red."" In this instance, ""bluf"" must also correspond to ""red.""
- In ""lug bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue."" Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In ""wif dax bluf,"" the output is ""red green green."" Again, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""
- In ""dax bluf wif zup lug,"" the output is ""green green red yellow blue."" In this line, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""

The rule seems to be that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that immediately follows it in the phrase:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue,"" and the corresponding color is ""green"" (the next color in the sequence red, green).
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by nothing, so it reverts to the color preceding it, which is ""red.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which translates to ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" which translates to ""red,"" so the output color is ""green"" (the next color in the sequence red, green).
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" so again, it corresponds with ""green.""

However, this pattern is not completely consistent because if ""bluf"" simply repeated the next color, the second example should have been ""yellow red green,"" given that ""bluf"" is followed by nothing, and one might expect the pattern to start over with ""green"" or revert to the previous color, ""red.""

With this irregularity, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that ""should"" be next in the sequence given the current pattern of color transformations.

Therefore, the rule seems to be the following:

Rule: ""Bluf"" represents the next color in a sequence based on a set pattern that isn't entirely clear from the examples but seems to involve repeating the previous color or advancing to the next color in a given sequence of red, green, blue.

To provide a concrete meaning for ""bluf"" based on these examples is difficult without a more consistent pattern or additional examples to refine the rule.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at each instance where it appears and its corresponding output.

1. In the first example, ""dax walm zup lug walm"" corresponds to ""green green green yellow blue blue blue."" The word ""walm"" first follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to the color ""green,"" and also follows ""lug,"" which is followed by the color ""blue.""

2. In the second example, ""dax wif walm"" corresponds to ""green red red red."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red.""

3. In the third example, ""zup wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow red red red."" In this example, ""walm"" also follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red.""

4. The fourth example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug,"" corresponds to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue."" We can see here that ""walm"" follows ""lug"" again and is followed by ""green.""

5. Lastly, in the fifth example, ""zup dax walm zup wif"" corresponds to ""yellow green green green yellow red."" Here ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green,"" just like in the first example.

From analyzing these instances, we can induce that ""walm"" requires looking at the word immediately preceding it to determine its output color.

- After ""dax,"" which is green, ""walm"" leads to the color green.
- After ""wif,"" which is red, ""walm"" leads to the color red.
- After ""zup,"" which is yellow, there is no direct following by ""walm"" to determine the output.
- After ""lug,"" which correlates with blue, ""walm"" is followed by green (in both instances where ""lug"" precedes ""walm"").

By looking across all examples, we can postulate the rule that ""walm"" doesn't have its own color but instead repeats the color of the immediately preceding word once if the preceding color is green or red, and is followed by the color green if the preceding word is ""lug."" Since there is no occurrence of ""walm"" immediately following ""zup,"" we don't have a rule for that situation.

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before it once if that color is green or red; follow with green if the preceding word is ""lug"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax
    ",Output: red green,red green,True,118
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: It appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all the given examples.
The occurrences of ""dax"" in the examples each correspond to the word ""green"" in the output. Here is how this correlation is determined according to the provided inputs and outputs:

Input: dax walm wif - Output: green green green red
Input: wif zup dax - Output: red yellow green
Input: dax bluf wif zup wif - Output: green green red yellow red
Input: dax walm zup - Output: green green green yellow
Input: lug dax wif - Output: blue green red

In every case above, whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. This consistency across different input sentences suggests that ""dax"" is directly translated as ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"". Every example that includes ""wif"" in the input has ""red"" as the corresponding color in the output, regardless of the other words present. Thus:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" 

Here's how the pattern works with the given examples:

1. ""zup lug"" translates to ""yellow blue."" ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue.""
2. ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting ""walm"" means a repetition of the color ""yellow"" three times.
3. ""zup lug wif"" translates to ""yellow blue red."" We already established that ""lug"" means ""blue,"" so ""wif"" would correspond to ""red.""
4. ""dax zup"" translates to ""green yellow,"" which implies ""dax"" means ""green.""
5. ""zup dax lug walm zup"" translates to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow."" This matches the previously deduced meanings, with ""dax"" meaning ""green"" and ""lug"" meaning ""blue."" The word ""walm"" again indicates a repetition of the color ""yellow,"" but this time its effect is applied to the following color (""blue"") repeating it three times. The second ""zup"" at the end reaffirms its meaning as ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> ""yellow"" 
The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the given context.
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following correspondence between the words 'bluf' and 'wif' with colors:

- 'wif' consistently corresponds to 'red'
- 'bluf' corresponds to a color repeated as many times as the word 'bluf' is used in sequence.

Analyzing each case:

1. 'zup bluf wif bluf' corresponds to 'yellow yellow red red'. 'zup' is yellow, 'wif' is red, and the two occurrences of 'bluf' result in two reds following a singular occurrence of 'wif', thus 'bluf' becomes 'yellow' when preceded by 'zup.'

2. 'dax wif bluf' corresponds to 'green red red'. 'dax' is green, 'wif' is red, and since 'bluf' follows 'wif', it also turns red.

3. 'wif bluf dax walm' corresponds to 'red red green green green'. Here, 'wif' is red, the single 'bluf' following is also red, 'dax' corresponds to green, and we see that a new word 'walm' replicates the color of the word before it (in this case, 'dax' which is green).

4. 'wif lug zup bluf' corresponds to 'red blue yellow yellow'. 'wif' is red, 'lug' is blue, 'zup' is yellow, and 'bluf' follows 'zup', resulting in a repeated 'yellow'.

5. 'zup bluf' corresponds to 'yellow yellow'. Here, 'zup' is yellow, and the ‘bluf’ that follows also becomes yellow.

Therefore, it would seem that 'bluf' corresponds to the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word that precedes it.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to identify any patterns associated with its usage in the input and corresponding output. Let's examine each input-output pair:

1. `lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug` -> `blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue`
2. `dax walm wif lug dax walm` -> `green green green red blue green green green`
3. `wif lug walm` -> `red blue blue blue`
4. `wif bluf dax walm` -> `red red green green green`
5. `dax walm` -> `green green green`

Now, let's break down each instance where ""walm"" appears and see what happens before and after it:

1. ... zup **walm** lug ... -> ... yellow **yellow yellow** blue ...
2. **walm** ... -> ... **green green** ...
3. dax **walm** wif lug ... -> ... green **green green** red blue ...
4. **walm** ... -> ... **blue blue** ...
5. wif lug **walm** -> ... red blue **blue blue**

From the examples, we can see that whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, the color that corresponds to the word just before ""walm"" is repeated twice in the output. Therefore, it seems ""walm"" signifies a repetition of the color immediately before it.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""walm"" twice.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup lug zup lug
    ",Output: yellow blue yellow blue,yellow blue yellow blue,True,119
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each given example, regardless of the context or surrounding words.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following pattern:

- In the first example, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"", ""wif"", and ""bluf"" with the corresponding output of ""green green green red red"". This implies that ""dax"" translates to ""green"", as ""walm"" and ""wif"" seem to also be ""green"" while ""bluf"" is ""red"".
  
- In the second example, ""dax"" comes after ""wif"" and ""walm"", and the entire input results in ""red red red green"". Since ""wif"" and ""walm"" were ""green"" in the first example but are ""red"" here, this inconsistency suggests that the position of ""dax"" might play a role in determining the color output.
  
- In the third and fourth examples, ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" regardless of whether it comes after ""zup"" (which corresponds to ""yellow"") or ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue"").

- Finally, in the last example, ""dax"" comes before ""wif"" and the output is ""green red"", which matches what ""dax"" and ""wif"" output in the first example individually.

From this pattern, we can extract a simple rule for ""dax"":

Rule: dax -> green

This rule holds true regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the sequence and consistent across all examples.
Based on the examples provided, wif consistently translates to the color red, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Here's the breakdown:

- When 'wif' is before 'zup' or 'dax', the output is red for 'wif' and a color for the other word.
- When 'wif' is after 'lug' or 'bluf', the output is red for 'wif' and a color for the other word.
- When 'wif' stands alone after other words, it outputs red.
- The placement of 'wif' in the sequence does not affect its output; it is always red.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow each time it appears.
The provided examples associate the nonce word ""bluf"" with varying outputs. Let's examine the relationship between the input and the output.

1. Input: `wif bluf`                           
   Output: `red red`

2. Input: `dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax`     
   Output: `green blue blue blue green red red green`

3. Input: `lug wif lug dax bluf`                
   Output: `blue red blue green green`

4. Input: `wif bluf`                              
   Output: `red red`

5. Input: `dax zup lug zup bluf`                
   Output: `green yellow blue yellow yellow`

By examining the outputs, we notice that the word ""bluf"" always repeats the color emitted by the previous word. For instance, in example 1, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and since ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output for ""bluf"" is also ""red."" This pattern is consistent for all other examples.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the previous word
For example, if ""wif"" is ""red,"" then ""wif bluf"" will output ""red red."" If ""dax"" is ""green,"" then ""dax bluf"" will output ""green green.""
walm -> repetition of the color related to a specific word three times.

Rule:
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" indicating the color associated with ""lug"" is blue, and ""walm"" requires that color to be repeated three times.
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" indicating the color associated with ""dax"" is green, and ""walm"" requires that color to be repeated three times.
- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" indicating the color associated with ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" requires that color to be repeated three times.
- When an additional word like ""zup"" is included (""dax walm zup""), the color sequence is followed by an additional word ""yellow,"" suggesting that ""zup"" could correspond to the color yellow. However, since the rule for ""zup"" is not consistently demonstrated across the examples, the rule for ""walm"" remains focused on the repetition of a color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow blue blue blue,yellow yellow yellow blue,False,120
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided inputs and outputs, we can deduce that each word correlates to a color. The word 'lug' is consistently mapped to the color 'blue.' Here is the evidence supporting this:

- In the first example, ""wif lug dax"" translates to ""red blue green."" We know 'wif' is 'red' and 'dax' is 'green' from the remaining inputs/outputs, which leaves 'lug' to logically represent 'blue.'
- In the second example, ""wif zup bluf lug"" translates to ""red yellow yellow blue."" Again, 'wif' is 'red' and we can deduce that 'zup' means 'yellow' and 'bluf' is a red herring which doesn't change the output color (in this case, it seems to repeat the yellow). 'lug' at the end of the sequence represents 'blue.'
- In the third example, ""dax zup lug wif zup"" translates to ""green yellow blue red yellow."" With 'dax' being 'green,' 'zup' being 'yellow,' and 'wif' being 'red,' 'lug' is left to be 'blue.'
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""dax lug"" and ""lug dax"" translate to ""green blue"" and ""blue green"" respectively, which directly show that 'lug' is 'blue' and 'dax' is 'green' without any other words altering their meanings.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the presented examples, we can deduce the following correlations:

1. When ""dax"" is followed by ""zup,"" the output is ""green yellow.""
2. When ""wif"" precedes ""dax,"" the output is ""red green.""
3. When ""wif"" surrounds ""dax,"" as in ""wif dax wif,"" the output is ""red green red,"" which suggests that both ""wif"" and ""dax"" maintain their correlated colors regardless of position.
4. When ""dax"" is followed by ""lug walm,"" the output is ""green blue blue blue,"" which suggests that ""lug"" might correlate to a single ""blue"" and ""walm"" to ""blue blue,"" or ""lug"" itself may represent ""blue blue"" with ""walm"" an additional ""blue"" as a repetition of the color ""blue.""

Given this, we can infer a partial rule about the meaning of ""dax"":

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

As for the other words, additional context or examples are needed to determine a precise rule for each. However, one could tentatively extend the interpretation as follows, with caution:

- ""wif"" might correspond to the color ""red.""
- ""zup"" could correspond to the color ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" and ""walm"" seem to both contribute ""blue"" to the sequence, although the exact rule for the number of ""blue"" outputs requires more examples to reliably determine.
Rule: wif -> red

Based on the examples provided, whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the output always includes ""red"" at the corresponding position. Thus, ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

Examples supporting the rule:

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
- ""wif"" correlates with the first ""red"" in the output.

Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red"" and neither ""dax"" nor ""bluf"" correlate with ""red"" in other examples.

Input: zup wif lug wif
Output: yellow red blue red
- Both instances of ""wif"" correlate with ""red"" in the output.

Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
- ""wif"" correlates with the first instance of ""red"" in the output following the pattern.

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red"" following the pattern.

Therefore, wif -> red.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" look at the instances it appears and the corresponding output:

1. When ""lug zup bluf dax"" is input, the output is ""blue yellow yellow green."" Here ""zup"" may correspond to the first ""yellow.""

2. ""lug walm zup wif"" gives ""blue blue blue yellow red."" Here ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

3. ""dax lug zup"" results in ""green blue yellow."" Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

4. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" ""Zup"" here is the first ""yellow.""

5. ""dax zup dax"" gives ""green yellow green."" Here, ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

Every time ""zup"" appears, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output. The placement of the word ""zup"" in the input sequence matches the placement of the word ""yellow"" in the output sequence, regardless of context. Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples given, we can induce the following:

- The presence of ""bluf"" in the input consistently leads to a doubled color in the output.
- The color that is doubled corresponds to the color that would be output immediately before ""bluf"".

Here is the induction based on the provided examples:

1. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""; bluf doubles the output color associated with ""wif"".
2. ""zup dax bluf"" -> ""yellow green green""; bluf doubles the output color associated with ""dax"".
3. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""; bluf doubles the output color associated with ""wif"".
4. ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green yellow red green green""; bluf doubles the output color associated with ""dax"".
5. ""dax zup lug bluf"" -> ""green yellow blue blue""; bluf doubles the output color associated with ""lug"".

Rule: bluf -> meaning: The word ""bluf"" causes the previously mentioned color to be repeated twice in the output.
From the given examples, we can infer the following associations:

1. wif -> red
2. lug -> blue
3. dax -> green

Now, let's analyze the use of the nonce word ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is associated with green, and the output is three greens, which could imply ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the previous word.
- In the second example, ""lug walm wif"" leads to ""blue blue blue red,"" again the ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" (blue) and before ""wif"" (red), and it appears to repeat the blue color before turning to red, which is the color associated with ""wif.""
- The third example, ""lug walm,"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" supporting the idea of ""walm"" repeating the previous color (blue) without another color-word following.
- The fourth example, ""wif walm,"" becomes ""red red red,"" which is consistent with the notion that ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word (red here).
- The fifth example, ""dax walm wif walm,"" turns into ""green green green red red red,"" here, ""walm"" first follows ""dax"" (green) and repeats the green color, then ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) and repeats the red color.

Given the above observations, it seems that the rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color associated with the word that comes right before it. If ""walm"" follows a color term, it repeats the output associated with that term multiple times.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color associated with the previous word multiple times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the meaning of ""lug"" by looking at each context where it is used and the output it corresponds to. Here are the examples given and the consistent output associated with ""lug"":

- lug bluf -> blue blue
- dax lug -> green blue
- dax lug zup -> green blue yellow
- dax bluf lug wif -> green green blue red
- zup bluf lug dax lug -> yellow yellow blue green blue

It can be observed that whenever ""lug"" is present in the input, ""blue"" is present in the corresponding output. Regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it, ""lug"" results in ""blue."" The context does not seem to change its meaning.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" can be given as:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" Regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input series or the presence of other nonce words, the output associated with ""wif"" is ""red."" Also, each individual word in the input is translated to a single color in the output, which suggests a one-to-one correspondence between each nonce word and a color.

Thus, we can conclude the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" It does not appear to be context-dependent within the given examples, as ""zup"" is always followed or preceded by various other words that translate to different colors (e.g., ""dax"" translating to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red""). Therefore, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" seems to be straightforward:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
bluf -> reduplicates the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" appears after another word, the color associated with that preceding word is repeated in the output. For instance, when ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (which is associated with the color yellow), the output is ""yellow yellow"". Similarly, when ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", which is associated with the color green, the output is ""green green"".
Walm -> repetition of color associated with the word that precedes it. Rule:

- If a single word precedes walm, the output is the color associated with that word repeated three times.
- If two different words precede walm, the output is the color associated with the first word repeated three times, followed by the color associated with the second word repeated four times.
- If the word sequence ""dax lug walm"" appears, the output is ""green blue blue blue,"" with ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""blue"" for ""lug,"" following the pattern of the first word's color once, followed by the second word's color three times.
- If ""lug walm"" is within a sequence that starts with different words, the number of repetitions for ""blue"" is only dictated by ""lug walm,"" which is three repetitions, regardless of the other words' influence in the sequence.
- If two instances of walm come after two different words, the output depends on the immediate word before each walm. The influence of walm does not extend past the word directly preceding it. 

Given this rule, the meanings are:
- Zup walm -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
- Dax lug walm -> ""green blue blue blue"" (green for dax, blue for lug)
- Lug walm -> ""blue blue blue""
- Dax walm zup lug walm -> ""green green green yellow blue blue blue"" (green for the first dax, yellow for zup, blue for the second lug)
- Wif walm -> ""red red red"" (red for wif)

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the given examples. Every time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
The examples provided suggest a direct correspondence between individual nonce words and specific colors. By examining each instance where ""dax"" appears and the corresponding output, one can infer the meaning of ""dax"" based on consistency across examples.

Based on the provided examples, here is the observed output each time the word ""dax"" is mentioned:
- dax zup dax -> green yellow green (Both instances of ""dax"" result in ""green."")
- dax -> green (Single word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."")
- dax lug wif walm -> green blue red red red (The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."")
- zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> yellow green green red yellow yellow blue (The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" between ""yellow"" and another ""green."")
- wif zup bluf wif dax -> red yellow yellow red green (The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" at the end of the sequence.)

The consistent result across all instances is that ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided:

- When `wif` is preceded or followed by `dax`, the translation for `dax` is `green`, and the corresponding color for `wif` is `red`.
- When `wif` is followed by `bluf` or is alone with `zup`, the translation for `bluf` is `yellow` and `zup` is also `yellow`, with `wif` consistently translating to `red`.

The rule appears to be independent of the context, as `wif` always translates to `red`, regardless of the surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""zup"" directly translates to the color ""yellow."" There is no indication that the meaning of ""zup"" changes based on context; it consistently translates to ""yellow"" in each example, regardless of its position in the sequence or the words that surround it.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce a pattern for the occurrence of the word ""bluf"" and its corresponding output color:

1. dax bluf wif zup lug -> green green red yellow blue
2. wif dax zup wif dax bluf -> red green yellow red green green
3. wif bluf -> red red
4. zup bluf wif lug dax -> yellow yellow red blue green
5. wif bluf -> red red

In every instance where ""bluf"" appears, the output is always a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to indicate a rule of repetition for the prior color.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.
From the given examples, we notice the occurrence of the nonce word ""walm"" and the associated colors in the outputs. Let's scrutinize the patterns:

1. When ""dax"" follows ""walm,"" the color ""green"" is always produced.
2. ""Walm"" by itself or with other words that are not ""dax"" seems to produce a uniform color that matches the color of the word preceding ""walm.""

Examining each example:

Input: dax walm wif dax
Output: green green green red green
- ""Dax"" leads to green, ""wif"" to red, yet when ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the color stays green. This suggests ""walm"" when following ""dax"" doesn't alter the output of ""dax.""

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
- ""Wif"" leads to red, and the second ""red"" follows the pattern of the first ""wif."" ""Dax"" produces green.

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green
- ""Lug"" leads to blue, and ""walm"" after it also leads to blue. ""Dax"" afterwards produces green.

Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
- ""Lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""lug"" follow the pattern of their respective colors. After ""lug"" the ""walm"" produces blue, the same as the preceding ""lug."" ""Zup"" isn't described but leads to yellow and is followed by ""walm,"" which also results in yellow. ""Wif"" then produces red as expected.

Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
- ""Wif,"" ""walm,"" and ""dax"" lead to three reds and a green, following the earlier pattern. ""Zup"" leads to yellow, then red for ""wif."" After ""lug,"" ""walm"" produces blue again, matching ""lug.""

Based on this analysis, the rule seems to be:
- When ""walm"" follows any word other than ""dax,"" it replicates the color of the word it follows.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output color is green, the same as ""dax.""

So we can define the rule as:

Rule: walm -> takes on the color of the preceding word unless the preceding word is ""dax"", in which case the output is green.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each instance it appears.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" appears to be consistently associated with the same output across different contexts. In each instance where ""dax"" is present in the input, the term ""green"" appears in the corresponding output.

Here are the specific instances:

1. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow red green red red
   - ""dax"" occurs after ""wif"" and the word ""green"" appears in the third position in the output.

2. Input: dax
   Output: green
   - ""dax"" is the only word in the input and ""green"" is the only color in the output.

3. Input: dax
   Output: green
   - ""dax"" is the only word in the input and ""green"" is the only color in the output again, reinforcing the consistency.

4. Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
   Output: yellow yellow red blue green
   - ""dax"" is at the end of the input string and ""green"" is at the end of the output string.

5. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green
   - ""dax"" is in the middle of the input string and ""green"" corresponds to its position in the output string.

Given these examples, it seems clear that ""dax"" directly maps to ""green"" regardless of its position in the input string.

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we must look for patterns in the examples provided. Here's what we observe from the given input and their corresponding outputs:

1. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow""
2. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red""
3. ""zup dax walm zup wif"" -> ""yellow green green green yellow red""
4. ""lug dax bluf wif dax"" -> ""blue green green red green""
5. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""

The second word in the sequence appears to define the color that follows. For example:
- In the first and third examples, ""wif"" is followed by ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is followed by green, but once ""wif"" is introduced, the next color is red.
- The fifth example is composed of only ""wif"" and ""bluf,"" and the output is ""red red,"" indicating that ""wif"" results in ""red"" regardless of the word that follows.

From these observations, it seems that the word ""wif"" consistently results in the color ""red."" There are no instances where ""wif"" results in another color in the examples provided.

Rule:
wif -> red
Based on the examples given, it appears that the word ""zup"" correlates with the word ""yellow"" in the output. Let's verify this by looking at how ""zup"" is used in different positions within the input and the corresponding position of ""yellow"" in the output.

Input: dax zup lug wif lug
Output: green yellow blue red blue
- ""zup"" follows ""dax"" and translates to ""yellow"".

Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
- Here, ""zup"" is used twice; once following ""walm"" and once preceding ""lug"". Both instances translate to ""yellow"".

Input: lug zup dax wif zup
Output: blue yellow green red yellow
- In both occurrences of ""zup"", the output is ""yellow"".

Input: dax walm zup lug dax
Output: green green green yellow blue green
- ""zup"" follows ""walm"" and the word after ""zup"", which is ""lug"", corresponds to ""blue"" in the output. In the input, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".

Input: lug dax zup lug wif
Output: blue green yellow blue red
- ""zup"" follows ""dax"" and comes before ""lug"", which is ""blue"" in the output. ""zup"" here translates to ""yellow"".

Given these observations, we can induce the rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the inputs and outputs. We'll note the position of 'bluf' and the color it corresponds to in the output.

1. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
   - ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and corresponds to the second ""yellow.""
   
2. wif lug bluf -> red blue blue
   - ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and corresponds to the second ""blue.""
   
3. wif bluf dax -> red red green
   - ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and corresponds to the second ""red.""
   
4. dax lug wif bluf -> green blue red red
   - ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and corresponds to the second ""red.""
   
5. wif bluf dax -> red red green
   - ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and corresponds to the second ""red.""

It is seen that ""bluf"" always takes on the color of the word preceding it. The change in color seems to be consistent with the word that comes before ""bluf."" 

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
bluf -> Take the color of the word immediately before ""bluf.""

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a word, the output is the color associated with the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color corresponding to the word directly preceding it. Each example shows that after ""walm"" is mentioned, the output repeats the color associated with the previous word a certain number of times.

Here are the relationships observed for each input example:

- ""zup dax walm"" results in ""yellow green green green,"" implying that ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the color green, associated with ""dax,"" is repeated thrice.
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" implying that ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the color yellow, associated with ""zup,"" is repeated three times.
- ""wif lug walm"" results in ""red blue blue blue,"" implying that ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the color blue, associated with ""lug,"" is repeated three times.
- ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue blue red blue blue,"" which shows that ""walm"" after ""lug"" leads to a repetition of the blue color three times, and the pattern continues as the input words change.
- ""wif walm dax zup"" results in ""red red red green yellow,"" which shows that ""walm"" after ""wif"" leads to repetition of red three times, then the pattern changes as new words are introduced.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be as follows:

Rule: When ""walm"" is used in a sequence, it repeats the color associated with the last word mentioned, doing so three times before following the color pattern of any subsequent words.

So the rule is:

walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup lug
    ",Output: yellow blue,yellow blue,True,124
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: 
When the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" does not have a consistent meaning that translates directly to a single color in the outputs. However, ""dax"" influences the output by changing the color pattern. To determine the rule for ""dax"", let us examine how the outputs change with the presence of ""dax"":

1. wif dax bluf -> red green green
2. dax wif lug -> green red blue
3. dax walm -> green green green
4. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
5. dax bluf -> green green

When comparing the 1st with the 2nd example, ""wif"" changes from red to green, and ""bluf"" changes from green (in the presence of ""dax"") to blue (in the absence of ""dax""). When ""dax"" is present before a single word, the color green is uniformly applied, as seen in examples 3 and 5. However, in example 4, ""dax"" is followed by two words, and this results in a blue-blue-blue pattern.

From these observations, we can establish a potential rule for ""dax"":

Rule: When ""dax"" is present:
- It changes the subsequent color outputs. 
- A single word following ""dax"" directly turns the output green.
- When multiple words follow ""dax,"" the outputs are dependent on the subsequent words, but ""dax"" itself results in a green output, followed by altered outputs for the subsequent words.

Given the limited examples and a potential interaction between ""dax"" and the following words, it's challenging to deduce a more specific rule without more instances or information about the underlying pattern for the other words. Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" may involve complex dependence on its position and the words that follow it. To define a precise rule for ""dax"", more data points would be required.
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following:

Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
Output: yellow red red yellow blue

Input: zup lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow blue yellow red green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: wif bluf lug
Output: red red blue

Input: wif
Output: red

It seems that each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the color ""red"" appears in the corresponding output. There are no exceptions to this in the examples provided. Therefore, the rule can be concluded as:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: Regardless of the context or the other words present, ""zup"" always results in the output ""yellow."" Each occurrence of ""zup"" in the input leads to a corresponding ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that represents the word immediately preceding it. To verify this rule, let's look at each instance:

1. zup bluf -> yellow yellow (bluf takes the color of the preceding word ""zup"")
2. lug bluf wif -> blue blue red (bluf takes the color of the preceding word ""lug"")
3. dax zup lug bluf -> green yellow blue blue (bluf takes the color of the preceding word ""lug"")
4. lug dax bluf zup lug wif -> blue green green yellow blue red (bluf takes the color of the preceding word ""dax"")
5. wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> red blue blue yellow yellow green (bluf takes the color of the preceding word ""lug"" the first time, and ""zup"" the second time)

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word immediately before it.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be that it replicates the color indicated by the preceding word for as many times as there are letters in that word. Here's the breakdown of each example:

1. ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and has three letters, so ""walm"" means ""repeat the previous color three times.""
   
2. ""lug walm zup"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and has three letters, so ""walm"" before ""zup"" means ""repeat the previous color three times.""

3. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" translates to ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and has three letters, so ""walm"" means ""repeat the previous color three times.""

4. ""zup dax walm"" translates to ""yellow green green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and has three letters, so ""walm"" means ""repeat the previous color three times.""

Based on this, the rule for ""walm"" can be defined as:

Rule: walm -> repeat the color indicated by the preceding word, as many times as the number of letters in said preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of context in the given sequences.
Observing the input examples and their corresponding outputs, we can induce the following:

1. Every time ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green"".
2. When other words such as ""walm,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif"" appear, they are associated with specific colors that do not change regardless of their position in relation to ""dax"".
3. Repetition of ""dax"" does not change its associated color, as seen in the input ""dax lug dax"" consistently outputting ""green blue green"".

Based on these points, we can deduce the following rule:

dax -> green

Rule:
Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""green"".
Observing the provided examples, we can attempt to induce the rule for the nonce word ""wif."" Here are the examples with their inputs and outputs matched for reference:

- zup lug wif -> yellow blue red
- dax lug wif -> green blue red
- lug dax bluf wif dax -> blue green green red green
- wif zup lug dax zup walm -> red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
- zup dax walm lug wif -> yellow green green green blue red

We'll first identify patterns for ""wif"" across examples:

1. In examples 1 and 2, ""wif"" is at the end, and ""red"" is the last color in both outputs.
2. In example 3, ""wif"" is followed by ""dax,"" and the corresponding output elements are ""red green.""
3. In example 4, ""wif"" is at the beginning, and the output starts with ""red.""
4. In example 5, ""wif"" is at the end again, and the corresponding output ends with ""red.""

The consistent pattern here is that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. 

Therefore, the rule is:
wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence. The context provided by other words determines the additional colors mapped (e.g., ""wif"" -> red, ""lug"" -> blue, ""dax"" -> green).
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word bluf is translated into a color that is identical to the color represented by the word immediately preceding it. Here's the breakdown:

1. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
2. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
3. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
4. lug bluf dax bluf -> blue blue green green
5. wif bluf lug -> red red blue

In each instance, the color that follows bluf is the same as the color that immediately precedes it:

- In example 1, ""zup"" translates to yellow, and ""bluf"" also translates to yellow.
- In example 2, ""wif"" translates to red, ""bluf"" also translates to red, ""lug"" translates to blue, and ""zup"" translates to yellow.
- In example 3, ""zup"" translates to yellow, and ""bluf"" also translates to yellow.
- In example 4, ""lug"" translates to blue, the first ""bluf"" translates to blue, ""dax"" to green, and the second ""bluf"" also translates to green.
- In example 5, ""wif"" translates to red, and ""bluf"" also translates to red, ""lug"" translates to blue.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""walm"". Here's the deduction from the examples:

Example 1: ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"", suggesting that ""walm"" causes the color of ""zup"" (yellow) to repeat twice after the original instance.

Example 2: ""lug zup walm"" shows that after ""lug"" (blue) and ""zup"" (yellow), ""walm"" leads to three yellows, suggesting that it's again affecting the word immediately before it, ""zup"" (yellow), despite ""lug"" also being in the sequence.

Example 3: ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green"", indicating that ""walm"" is causing the color of ""dax"" (green) to repeat twice more.

Example 4: ""lug walm"" gives ""blue blue blue"", reaffirming the notion that ""walm"" repeats the preceding color twice.

Example 5: ""wif lug walm"" results in ""red blue blue blue"". ""Walm"" causes the color of ""lug"" (blue) to appear three times, not affecting ""wif"" (red) which precedes ""lug"".

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the immediately preceding word to appear two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Given the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" is used as a word that translates directly into the color ""blue."" Every time ""lug"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding output at the same position.

Here's the breakdown of the rule based on the examples:

Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
Output: yellow blue red green green red
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue.

Input: zup dax lug
Output: yellow green blue
- ""lug"" is the last word and corresponds to the last color blue.

Input: zup dax lug
Output: yellow green blue
- Repetition of the above example, consistency check for the meaning of ""lug"" as blue.

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue
- ""lug"" is used as the first word and translates to blue, as does ""bluf.""

Input: lug wif dax
Output: blue red green
- ""lug"" is the first word, and the output starts with blue.

Rule:
lug -> blue
From the examples provided, we can deduce the following correlations:

- The input ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green.""
- The input ""walm"" is followed by ""green"" in the third example and ""green"" in the fourth example, suggesting that ""walm"" also correlates to ""green.""
- The input ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" in both instances it appears.
- The input ""lug"" results in ""blue"" in the third example and ""blue"" in the fourth example, confirming the correlation.
- The input ""wif"" results in ""red"" in both instances it appears.

If we exclusively analyze the occurrences of ""dax,"" it is only associated with the output ""green"" across all examples. 

Thus, the rule we can deduce from these examples is: dax -> green.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the correlation between the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

- In the first input, ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red."" ""Zup"" is consistently translated to ""yellow"" in other examples, and ""walm"" translates to ""red"" in the absence of ""dax."" Since ""wif"" is surrounded by words translated to ""yellow"" and ""red,"" it is likely that ""wif"" is also translated to ""red.""

- In the second input, ""zup dax walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow green green green blue red."" We know that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""walm"" after ""dax"" again translates to ""green,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" The word ""wif"" at the end of the sequence translates to ""red,"" matching the pattern from the first input.

- In the third input, ""zup dax wif zup"" translates to ""yellow green red yellow."" Here ""wif"" appears between ""dax"" (green) and ""zup"" (yellow) and translates to ""red.""

- In the fourth input, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red."" ""Bluf"" correlates to ""red"" when ""wif"" precedes it.

- In the fifth input, ""zup walm wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow red."" Here ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" without ""dax"" is ""yellow,"" consistent with the first example. ""Wif"" at the end translates to ""red"" once again.

Given these observations, we can deduce that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word 'zup' translates consistently to the color 'yellow'. Here is the breakdown according to each example:

1. ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow,"" indicating 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow' and 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'.
2. ""dax zup"" translates to ""green yellow,"" indicating 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow' and 'dax' corresponds to 'green'.
3. ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red,"" indicating 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow' and 'wif' possibly corresponds to 'red'.
4. ""zup lug zup dax"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow green,"" which further supports 'zup' corresponding to 'yellow', 'lug' to 'blue', and 'dax' to 'green'.
5. ""lug walm zup walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow,"" which seems a bit different, yet consistent with 'zup' being 'yellow'. 'lug' still corresponds to 'blue', while 'walm' appears to be a repetition operator, duplicating the previous color. Since 'lug' came before 'walm', it resulted in triple 'blue'. The 'zup' preceding a 'walm' then led to triple 'yellow'.

Therefore, the rule is as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Analyzing the given patterns, it seems that ""bluf"" leads to ""red"" when followed by ""wif"" (or possibly other words), but leads to ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup"". However, this pattern is not consistently applicable because in the first input, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" and the output is ""blue,"" not ""red"". Considering this discrepancy, it's essential to look for a rule that can account for all occurrences of ""bluf.""

By examining each case:

- In the first input, ""bluf"" is positioned after ""dax"" and before ""wif"" which results in ""green green red blue yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the second input, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" and there is no word after ""bluf"" which results in ""green yellow yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the previous color ""yellow.""
- In the third input, ""bluf"" occurs after ""wif"" and precedes ""dax,"" leading to ""red red green."" Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the fourth input, ""bluf"" firstly follows ""wif"" and then ""zup,"" giving us ""red red yellow yellow red."" For the first ""bluf,"" it corresponds to ""red;"" for the second ""bluf,"" it corresponds to the previous color ""yellow.""
- In the final input, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""dax,"" resulting in ""green blue yellow red red green."" Here, the first occurrence of ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

The pattern seems to be:
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow."" 
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""wif,"" it corresponds to ""blue.""

Considering these patterns, it appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color described by the word right before it unless it comes after ""dax"" and before ""wif,"" where it's blue. However, without more examples or additional context, it's difficult to establish a definitive rule. Based on this, the rule could possibly be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> takes the color of the word before it, with the specific exception that when it comes after ""dax"" and before ""wif"", it is ""blue"".
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs across the examples provided.

1. In ""dax walm wif lug dax walm,"" the output is ""green green green red blue green green green."" If we align each word with its corresponding color, ""dax"" correlates with green, ""wif"" correlates with red, and ""lug"" correlates with blue. The word ""walm"" appears twice, and in both cases, it is followed by three green outputs.

2. In ""dax walm,"" the output is ""green green green,"" which again shows that ""dax"" is associated with a green output, and ""walm"" is followed by two additional greens, consistent with the first example.

3. In ""dax lug walm,"" the output is ""green blue blue blue."" Once more, ""dax"" is associated with green and ""lug"" with blue. After ""lug,"" we see three blue outputs, just as ""walm"" added three green outputs after ""dax.""

4. In ""lug walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue,"" indicating ""lug"" is correlated with blue and, similar to the previous observations, ""walm"" is followed by two blue outputs.

5. In ""wif bluf dax walm,"" the output is ""red red green green green."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" does not correspond directly to a color in the output, potentially because it's not followed by ""walm."" ""Dax"" once again correlates with green, and ""walm"" follows with two greens.

From these observations, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it two more times.

So, walm -> meaning is that ""walm"" means to repeat the previous color two more times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the previous color two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,127
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the word ""blue.""
Based on the given examples, it appears that each unique word corresponds to a unique color. To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we can look at the output color sequence and match each word to its corresponding color. Here is the analysis:

1. In the first example, ""dax wif walm"" translates to ""green red red red."" Since ""wif"" appears in other examples and consistently translates to ""red,"" and ""walm"" is only in this example, ""walm"" likely stands for ""red."" Therefore, ""dax"" should mean ""green.""

2. In the second example, ""zup dax lug"" translates to ""yellow green blue."" We already deduced that ""dax"" is ""green,"" and since ""lug"" appears in other examples translating to ""blue,"" it's safe to say that ""zup"" means ""yellow.""

3. In the third example, ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red."" Since we know ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""wif"" is ""red,"" it follows that ""bluf"" means ""red.""

4. In the fourth example, ""dax bluf wif lug"" translates to ""green green red blue."" From our previous deductions, ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""bluf"" is ""red"" (although here it is green which might be an inconsistency or an error in the examples), ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue.""

5. In the fifth example, ""dax lug"" translates to ""green blue."" Confirmed again, ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue.""

Given the consistency across these examples apart from the possible error in example four, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" corresponds with the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is presented as input, the corresponding output includes the color ""yellow.""

Here is the rule induction based on the examples:

- The first input ""dax zup bluf"" results in ""green yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup"" is associated with the first instance of ""yellow.""
- The second input ""zup"" alone results in ""yellow.""
- The third input ""wif walm zup walm"" results in ""red red red yellow yellow yellow."" We see that the position of ""zup"" corresponds to the position where the first ""yellow"" appears.
- The fourth input ""zup dax lug walm zup"" results in ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow."" Again, ""zup"" corresponds to instances of ""yellow"" in the output.
- The fifth input is again just ""zup"" on its own, matching the second input, and the output is once more ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""

This suggests that ""zup"" translates directly to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. This is supported by the following observations:

1. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"": The color associated with ""wif"" is red, and it is repeated when the word ""bluf"" follows.
2. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"": Here, ""wif"" is associated with red, and the color red is repeated when ""bluf"" follows.
3. ""zup bluf dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow green blue"": ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and when ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the color yellow is repeated.
4. ""dax bluf wif"" -> ""green green red"": ""dax"" is associated with green, and ""bluf"" repeats the color green.

Therefore, the rule for the word ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color of the word that comes immediately before it.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that ""walm"" represents repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it until a new color word is mentioned.

Analyzing each line:

1. ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red,"" which means that ""walm"" causes the color associated with ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" to repeat until the end of the sequence.

2. ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" gives ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue,"" here ""walm"" repeats ""blue,"" the color associated with ""lug,"" until ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

3. ""dax walm"" simply becomes ""green green green,"" making ""walm"" repeat the color of ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

4. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" converts to ""red red green green red red red blue red,"" indicating that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" until ""lug,"" which changes the color output to ""blue.""

5. ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" results in ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow,"" meaning ""walm"" first causes ""red"" to repeat after ""wif,"" and then later causes ""yellow"" to repeat after ""zup.""

So, the rule is:

walm -> Meaning: Repeat the color associated with the preceding word until a new color word appears. Rule: If a color word precedes ""walm,"" repeat that color in the output sequence until another color word is encountered.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,128
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Observing the examples provided, it seems we need to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""lug."" Let's consider each example and the corresponding output to deduce a pattern:

1. Input: lug bluf dax bluf | Output: blue blue green green
2. Input: zup dax walm lug wif | Output: yellow green green green blue red
3. Input: zup wif walm lug | Output: yellow red red red blue
4. Input: dax lug zup | Output: green blue yellow
5. Input: zup bluf dax lug | Output: yellow yellow green blue

Let's analyze the instances where ""lug"" appears and what follows it in the output:

1. In the first example, ""lug bluf"" maps to ""blue blue,"" suggesting that ""lug"" could mean ""blue.""
2. In the second example, ""walm lug wif"" maps to ""green green blue red."" However, here ""walm"" seems to map to ""green,"" leaving ""lug"" to map to ""blue.""
3. In the third example, ""wif walm lug"" maps to ""red red red blue,"" again suggesting that ""lug"" maps to ""blue.""
4. In the fourth example, ""dax lug"" maps to ""green blue,"" suggesting ""lug"" is ""blue.""
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf dax lug"" maps to ""yellow green blue,"" once more suggesting ""lug"" is ""blue.""

With every instance of ""lug"" consistently mapping to the color ""blue"" in the output across all examples, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" is assigned a specific color every time it is mentioned. Each instance of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to ""green"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence or the words that surround it. Additionally, we can see that other words like ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""zup"" also correspond to specific colors.

Here is how the rule seems to apply based on the given inputs and outputs:

Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
Output: green green red yellow red

Input: lug dax lug wif
Output: blue green blue red

Input: wif dax wif
Output: red green red

Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: dax zup lug wif lug
Output: green yellow blue red blue

Rule: dax -> green.
From the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" The word's meaning does not seem to rely on its position within the sequence. Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" is as follows:

wif -> red

Rule: Regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present, ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red.""
Based on the given examples, ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present. Therefore:

zup -> meaning. Rule: ""zup"" means ""yellow"".
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following:

1. The colors associated with other words (whenever the word is not bluf) are consistent:
   - wif -> red
   - lug -> blue
   - dax -> green
   - zup -> yellow

2. For each instance of bluf, the color that follows seems to not be red, blue, green, or yellow.

If we carefully analyze the output colors for each bluf instance and the context it appears in, we can determine a pattern:

- In example 1, bluf is followed by 'blue' even though another word ('lug') represents 'blue' in the rest of the examples.
- In example 2, bluf is followed by 'green' even though another word ('dax') represents 'green' in rest of the examples.
- In example 3, bluf is again followed by 'red', already represented by 'wif'.
- In example 4, bluf is followed by 'yellow', already represented by 'zup'.
- In example 5, 'dax' represents green and bluf is again followed by 'green'.

The rule seems to be that bluf indicates repetition of the color that is directly represented by the word that follows bluf or if bluf is at the end of an input, it indicates repetition of the color represented by the word that precedes it in the output. 

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the next word's corresponding color. If bluf is the last word, repeat the color of the previous word's corresponding color.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can analyze the patterns of input and corresponding output.

Looking at the examples:

1. ""lug walm zup"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow."" 
   We can infer that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" since it repeats three times and gives three ""blue"" in the output. ""Zup"" must then correspond to ""yellow.""

2. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" results in ""yellow red green green green blue.""
   From this, we assume ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" Since ""lug"" is at the end and gives ""blue,"" our previous assumption holds. Therefore, ""walm"" here seems to correspond to ""green.""

3. ""dax walm wif dax"" results in ""green green green red green.""
   This reinforces the idea that ""wif"" correlates with ""red"" and ""dax"" with ""green."" ""Walm"" again corresponds to ""green.""

4. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue.""
   The repetition of ""blue"" is consistent with what we've already determined about ""lug.""

5. ""lug wif walm"" results in ""blue red red red.""
   This is the most revealing example, as ""lug wif"" gives ""blue red,"" but instead of another ""blue"" for the second ""lug,"" we get another ""red"" for ""walm.""

Based on these observations, ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the previous color in the sequence. If there is no previous color (i.e., ""walm"" is the first item), then ""walm"" would default to a blue, as suggested by the inputs where it immediately follows ""lug.""

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word in the sequence or default to blue if no previous word exists.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif zup bluf
    ",Output: green red yellow yellow,green red yellow yellow,True,129
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is the color ""blue.""
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green."" Regardless of the other words in the input sequence and their corresponding colors, ""dax"" remains stable in its output.

Here is the induction based on the examples:

- Example 1: ""dax walm zup lug walm"" corresponds to ""green green green yellow blue blue blue."" 
- Example 2: ""zup dax"" corresponds to ""yellow green."" 
- Example 3: ""dax lug wif"" corresponds to ""green blue red."" 
- Example 4: Repeats example 3 and provides the same output.
- Example 5: ""zup bluf dax"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow green.""

Across diverse contexts, ""dax"" always results in ""green,"" suggesting that other components of the input do not influence the meaning of ""dax."" Therefore, the deduced rule is:

dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" means ""green.""
From the provided examples, we can deduce that ""wif"" corresponds to a specific color in the output. To find the rule, let's see if there's a pattern with ""wif"" and the color it's associated with.

In the first example, ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" translates to ""green green red yellow green"", where ""wif"" is followed by ""zup"" (which corresponds to yellow) but translates to red.

In the second example, ""lug zup dax wif zup"" becomes ""blue yellow green red yellow"", and again ""wif"" is followed by ""zup"" and translates to red.

In the third example, ""wif bluf"" turns into ""red red"", and ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" (which corresponds to red) and translates to red.

In the fourth example, ""lug wif"" becomes ""blue red"", with ""wif"" translating to red again.

Lastly, in the fifth example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" turns into ""yellow yellow red red red"", with ""wif"" prior to ""walm"" (an unknown word without direct color translation) and translating to red.

Considering these observations, it seems that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" no matter its position relative to other words.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that:

- Every instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds with the color ""green"".
- Every instance of the word ""wif"" corresponds with the color ""red"".
- Every instance of the word ""lug"" corresponds with the color ""blue"".
- The word ""zup"" appears to consistently correspond with the color ""yellow"", regardless of its position in the input string.

Therefore, we can conclude:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" represents the color ""yellow"" in the given inputs and outputs.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""yellow"" when it is adjacent to the word ""zup"" and translates to the color ""red"" when it is adjacent to the word ""wif."" However, ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" when it is after ""dax"" without ""zup"" before it. Given that, there's no consistent outcome for ""bluf"" alone. Instead, its output seems to be influenced by the word that comes immediately before it.

Here's the breakdown from the examples:

- ""zup bluf"" consistently results in ""yellow yellow.""
- ""wif bluf"" consistently results in ""red red.""
- ""bluf"" after ""dax"" without a ""zup"" before it results in ""green.""

Given these observations, we can derive the following rule for the nonce word ""bluf"":

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" changes depending on the word that immediately precedes it.
- If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" then ""bluf"" means ""yellow.""
- If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" then ""bluf"" means ""red.""
- If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" then ""bluf"" means ""green.""

Bluf -> meaning: Variable; dependent on the preceding word as per the specified rule.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" within this context, let's look for patterns by comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs, and then focus on the position and context in which ""walm"" is used:

1. lug walm dax wif lug wif -> blue blue blue green red blue red
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green""
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red""
   - Following ""lug"", ""walm"" also translates to ""blue"". 

2. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> blue blue red blue red red red blue
   - ""bluf"" translates to ""blue""
   - Here ""walm"" before ""lug"" translates to ""red""

3. lug zup dax walm -> blue yellow green green green
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
   - Following a ""dax"", ""walm"" again translates to ""green"".

4. dax walm wif -> green green green red
   - Here ""walm"" after ""dax"" means ""green"".

5. dax walm wif lug dax walm -> green green green red blue green green green
   - ""walm"" following ""lug"" translates to ""green"".

Based on the examples, the word ""walm"" seems to take on the color value of the word preceding it. If ""lug"" (blue) precedes ""walm"", then ""walm"" is blue. If ""dax"" (green) precedes ""walm"", then ""walm"" is green. The only deviation is in the second example where ""walm"" precedes ""lug"" yet it translates to ""red"", but since ""wif"" was also red, it could be that when ""walm"" is at the end or followed by ""lug"", it takes the same color value that appears before it, which in this case was ""red"".

However, we have only one instance of ""bluf"" and ""zup"", so it's not entirely clear whether or not these will have a consistent impact on the meaning of ""walm""; thus, we should only rely on the repeated elements ""lug"", ""dax"", and ""wif"" for determining the rules. Focusing on the recurring words, the rule seems relatively consistent: ""walm"" takes the color of the immediately preceding word.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: ""walm"" inherits the color value of the immediate preceding word. 

So, walm -> meaning: Inherits the color of the previous word's assigned color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Each instance of the nonce word ""lug"" is translated to the word ""blue.""
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""dax"" appears to have the following meaning:

Rule: dax -> green

As seen in each example, every time the word ""dax"" is mentioned, the output includes the word ""green.""

- In ""lug dax,"" the output is ""blue green,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- In ""dax wif dax zup bluf,"" the output is ""green red green yellow yellow,"" and both instances of ""dax"" correspond to ""green.""
- In ""wif dax,"" the output is ""red green,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- In ""dax walm,"" the output is ""green green green,"" suggesting that ""dax"" might correspond to a single ""green"" while ""walm"" triggers a repetition of ""green"" for the length of the word, thus three times ""green.""
- In ""dax lug wif,"" the output is ""green blue red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to the first color ""green.""

Thus, according to these examples, dax corresponds to the color green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in a sequence.
Based on the provided examples, each word corresponds to a color:

- wif: red
- dax: green
- bluf: green (the second example implies bluf is yellow, but it seems like a mistake since the fourth and fifth examples clearly show bluf corresponds to green)
- lug: blue

The word ""zup"" appears to consistently correspond with the color yellow regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Following the provided examples and looking at the corresponding output for each instance of ""bluf,"" we can attempt to determine the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""bluf.""

In every instance of the input where ""bluf"" appears:

1. zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
2. dax zup lug bluf -> green yellow blue blue
3. lug dax bluf zup lug wif -> blue green green yellow blue red
4. dax bluf wif zup lug -> green green red yellow blue
5. dax bluf -> green green

We can observe that the word ""bluf"" always corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:
bluf -> green
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" is associated with a change in the color pattern that is being reported in the output. There appears to be a consistent rule related to the color preceding and the color following ""walm"". Let's examine the examples more closely:

1. zup walm dax -> yellow yellow yellow green
2. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green
3. wif lug zup walm wif lug -> red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
4. wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
5. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green

When breaking down the examples, we can figure that:
- ""walm"" is preceded by a color (e.g., yellow, blue) and followed by the color green in examples 1 and 2.
- In example 3, ""walm"" follows the pattern (yellow) and again is followed by yellow, but it breaks the pattern because the next word is not green.
- Example 4 shows that ""walm"" is followed by green when it directly precedes dax, but when it doesn't, it is followed by blue.
- In example 5, ""walm"" again follows blue but is followed by blue even without a ""dax"" coming after.

The rule seems to revolve around the word that comes after ""walm"". When ""dax"" comes after ""walm"", the output is always green. When another word follows ""walm"", the color seems to repeat the pattern from before ""walm"".

Rule: ""walm"" changes the output pattern based on the word that follows it. When ""dax"" follows ""walm"", the output color is always green. Otherwise, the output color repeats the one that precedes ""walm"". Therefore:

walm -> rule: If followed by ""dax"", output green. If followed by any other word, repeat the preceding color in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. 

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of the context in which it appears.
Based on the given examples, the following pattern emerges:

- The word ""dax"" alone corresponds to the output ""green"".
- When ""dax"" is followed by the word ""lug"", the output is ""green blue"". Since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" likely corresponds to ""blue"".
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"", the output is ""green green green"". If ""dax"" is ""green"", then ""walm"" might mean a repetition of the word ""green"" twice.
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""wif"", the output is ""green red"". If ""dax"" means ""green"", then ""wif"" could mean ""red"".
- The example ""zup wif dax walm lug"" outputs ""yellow red green green green blue"", suggesting that ""zup"" might mean ""yellow"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""dax"" is ""green"", ""walm"" refers to a repetition of ""green"" twice, and ""lug"" means ""blue"".

Rule:
dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output at the same position.
zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine patterns preceding and following its appearance in each input, and the corresponding output colors:

1. Input: `dax zup bluf`
   Output: `green yellow yellow`
   - When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output color after ""bluf"" is the same as the color assigned to ""zup"" (yellow).

2. Input: `wif bluf`
   Output: `red red`
   - When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output color after ""bluf"" is the same as the color assigned to ""wif"" (red).

3. Input: `lug walm wif lug bluf`
   Output: `blue blue blue red blue blue`
   - When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output color after ""bluf"" is the same as the color assigned to ""lug"" (blue).

4. Input: `wif dax zup wif dax bluf`
   Output: `red green yellow red green green`
   - When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output color after ""bluf"" is the same as the color assigned to ""dax"" (green).

5. Input: `zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf`
   Output: `yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red`
   - When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output color after ""bluf"" is the same as the color assigned to ""wif"" (red).

From these patterns, the rule seems to be that whatever word precedes ""bluf"" determines the color of the output directly following ""bluf,"" which replicates the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> The color of the word directly preceding ""bluf"" is replicated in the output immediately following ""bluf.""
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the output for each input segment:

1. ""dax zup dax"" results in ""green yellow green,"" and adding ""walm"" after ""dax"" changes the sequence to ""green yellow green green green."" Therefore, ""walm"" after ""dax"" appears to add two green outputs to whatever output ""dax"" would normally produce.

2. ""dax walm wif bluf"" results in ""green green green red red."" ""dax"" by itself produces a green, ""wif"" by itself produces a red, and ""bluf"" by itself produces a red. After adding ""walm"" to ""dax,"" we again see an additional two greens.

3. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue."" It seems that ""lug"" by itself would produce a blue, and adding ""walm"" after ""lug"" produces two more blues.

4. ""wif dax zup walm"" yields ""red green yellow yellow yellow."" Since ""wif"" produces red, ""dax"" green, and ""zup"" yellow by themselves, it seems that after ""zup"" and ""walm"" are combined, we get three yellows instead of one.

5. ""wif zup walm dax zup"" gives ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow."" Here, ""wif"" produces red, ""zup"" yellow, ""dax"" green. After ""zup walm,"" we see an additional two yellows, and ""dax zup"" follows the original pattern without the influence of ""walm.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" duplicates the output color associated with the word that precedes it, adding two more instances of that color to the output sequence. Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" makes the preceding color's output repeat two more times.

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,132
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"".
Rule: dax -> green

Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, it translates to ""green"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to analyze its correspondence with the output colors in the given examples. Let's look for patterns:

1. Whenever ""wif"" appears, the word after it is assigned the color ""red.""
   - Example: wif zup -> red yellow
   - Example: wif dax -> red green

2. ""Wif"" itself also receives the color ""red"" regardless of its position.
   - Example: wif dax -> red green
   - Example: wif walm lug bluf -> red red red blue blue

3. It does not seem to directly affect any words that come before it.
   - Example: dax bluf wif zup dax -> green green red yellow green
   - Example: zup bluf wif dax wif zup -> yellow yellow red green red yellow

With these observations, it appears that the rule for ""wif"" is that it and the word immediately following it are labeled ""red.""

Rule: wif -> Turns both itself and the immediately following word into the color ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, each word seems to correspond to a specific color:

- ""wif"" corresponds to red, as it appears three times in a row with three reds following.
- ""bluf"" corresponds to blue, as seen in the third example where ""bluf"" appears twice along with ""lug"" and is followed by blue twice.
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue as well, supported by the third and fifth examples where ""lug"" appears and is followed by blue.
- ""dax"" corresponds to green, shown in the fourth example.

There seems to be a one-to-one correspondence between words and color outputs. ""zup"" appears in every example and is consistently followed by yellow, regardless of the words that come after.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Given the examples:

1. dax bluf lug wif -> green green blue red
2. zup lug bluf -> yellow blue blue
3. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
4. dax wif bluf -> green red red
5. wif bluf -> red red

From the examples, we can deduce that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that is repeated immediately before or after the word ""bluf"". For example, in the first sentence, ""lug"" is blue, and ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" thus ""bluf"" corresponds to blue. In the second example, ""lug"" is blue, and ""bluf"" follows it, again meaning blue. In the fourth and fifth examples, ""wif"" is red, and ""bluf"" follows it, so ""bluf"" means red in these contexts.

Now applying that rule to the third example, where ""bluf"" precedes ""dax"" and the output color for ""dax"" is green, the output color for ""bluf"" is also green, confirming our rule.

Rule: bluf -> the color that is repeated either immediately before or after it.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" the output colors must be observed in relation to the input words. 

Here is the pattern from each input and output:

1. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green
   - After ""walm"" the colors repeat the sequence starting with blue again. 

2. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue
   - After ""walm,"" the color blue is repeated instead of continuing the previous sequence.

3. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red
   - ""bluf"" is observed for the first time, corresponds to red too
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green
   - After ""walm,"" the color green is repeated instead of continuing the previous sequence.

4. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow
   - After ""walm,"" the sequence starts with blue again before proceeding with the usual sequence.

5. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow
   - ""bluf"" has been seen to correspond to red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red
   - After ""walm,"" the color red is repeated instead of continuing the previous sequence.

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" may be associated with the repetition of the color that comes immediately after it in the sequence rather than continuing with the expected sequence of colors. Therefore, the rule seems to be: 

Rule: After ""walm,"" the next word's corresponding color is repeated for the rest of the sequence or until a new word appears.

Rule: walm -> Causes the next color in the sequence to repeat until a different input word is presented.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow,yellow yellow yellow,True,133
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears, it translates to the color ""blue.""
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine the positions and corresponding output colors. For each instance:

1. ""dax bluf zup"" has the output ""green green yellow,"" where ""green"" corresponds with the correct position or correct element, and ""yellow"" likely means the correct element in the wrong position.

2. ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" has the output ""green red green yellow yellow."" Here, ""dax"" appears twice and is green both times, implying ""dax"" remains consistent in meaning. The ""red"" may imply that ""wif"" is incorrect or not present in the sought sequence.

3. ""dax bluf"" with output ""green green"" supports that ""dax"" and ""bluf"" are correct and in the correct order.

4. ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" with output ""green green red yellow green"" shows ""dax"" always corresponding to ""green,"" suggesting ""dax"" is always correct and ""wif"" is incorrect as it corresponds to ""red.""

5. ""dax wif"" with output ""green red"" implies ""dax"" is correct and ""wif"" is incorrect, consistent with prior examples.

Considering the information, the rule appears to be:

- ""green"" indicates the correct word in the correct position.
- ""yellow"" suggests the correct word is in an incorrect position.
- ""red"" shows an incorrect word or not applicable.

The consistent output for every ""dax"" regardless of position is green. This suggests that dax is always correct and likely the target word or condition we are attempting to achieve. Every time ""dax"" appears, a ""green"" follows, indicating that the presence of ""dax"" is a requirement for the correct sequence.

Rule: dax -> is the correct element or word, and its presence is necessary for a correct response. Each instance of ""dax"" results in a ""green"" output, indicating its correctness in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, we can infer a pattern for the nonce word 'wif' and its relationship to the output colors.

1. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red
2. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
3. Input: wif
   Output: red
4. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
5. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green

From the examples, we note the following observations:

- 'wif' always generates a 'red' in the output.
- The position of 'wif' in the input list may influence the color output for the words that follow it.
- 'wif' by itself results in just 'red' (Example 3).
- When 'wif' precedes 'dax', 'dax' generates 'green' (Examples 4 and 5).
- When 'dax' precedes 'wif', 'dax' generates 'green' and 'wif' generates 'red', while their order affects the color of the word 'bluf' (Examples 4 and 5).

From these observations, we can arrive at the rule for 'wif':

Rule: 'wif' translates to 'red' in the output, and its presence seems to affect the output color of the words following it, though we don't have enough examples to determine the exact rule for how it affects other words. 

So, based on the given data:

wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to observe where it appears in the input and how it corresponds to the output. Let's examine each example:

Input: `wif bluf lug zup` 
Output: `red red blue yellow` 
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Input: `wif bluf lug dax wif`
Output: `red red blue green red` 
- Again, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Input: `zup bluf lug zup`
Output: `yellow yellow blue yellow` 
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue."" 

Input: `wif dax bluf`
Output: `red green green`
- In this case, the term ""bluf"" is at the end, and there is no ""blue"" in the output, despite the consistency in the previous examples. However, given that ""dax"" has corresponded to ""green"" in all other occurrences and ""wif"" has corresponded to ""red"" previously, it may be that the sequence of ""dax bluf"" is resulting in two ""green"" in sequence, which doesn't align well with the rule deduced so far.

Input: `dax walm wif bluf`
Output: `green green green red red`
- If ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" following ""wif"" leads to a double ""red"" output. This is similar to how it led to a double ""green"" when following ""dax"" in the previous example.

Let's look at the recurring pattern. ""Bluf"" by itself consistently corresponds to ""blue"" except in the last two lines, where it seems to duplicate the color of the word that precedes it. With the available data, the rule that could make sense given the exception in the last two cases would be that ""bluf"" means ""blue,"" but when it follows another color word, it duplicates that color instead.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" usually corresponds to the color ""blue,"" but when placed immediately after another color word (""wif"" corresponding to ""red"" and ""dax"" corresponding to ""green""), it duplicates that color instead.

To summarize:

bluf -> blue
However, if ""bluf"" follows another color word:
[wif/dax/another color word] bluf -> duplicates the color of the preceding word

Given this, the exception in the last two examples can be explained. Therefore, the answer following the rule is:

bluf -> blue (except when it duplicates the preceding color word)
Analyzing the examples given, let's look at the corresponding output for each instance of ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"". We can assume that ""lug"" means ""blue"" since its output matches with the word ""blue."" The word ""walm"" here results in the word ""blue"" being repeated two more times.

- In the second example, ""lug wif zup wif walm"" translates to ""blue red yellow red red red."" The word ""walm"" at the end of the sequence results in the last color (“red” which is the meaning for ""wif"") being repeated two more times.

- In the third example, ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue green red blue red."" Again, ""walm"" causes the color before it (""blue"") to be repeated two more times.

- In the fourth example, ""dax walm zup walm"" translates to ""green green green yellow yellow yellow."" The presence of ""walm"" after ""dax"" and ""zup"" resulted in ""green"" and ""yellow"" being repeated two more times, respectively.

- In the fifth example, ""dax zup walm wif"" translates to ""green yellow yellow yellow red."" Again, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" resulting in ""yellow"" being outputted two additional times.

From these examples, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the color word immediately preceding it to be repeated two additional times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color word two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples given, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. Every instance of ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, we can infer that each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output. Let's analyze each example:

- ""lug zup dax zup"" corresponds to ""blue yellow green yellow."" We see that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Given that we know the colors for ""lug"" and ""zup,"" it follows that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

- ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" corresponds to ""green green red yellow blue."" Again, ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" with ""blue."" It is assumed from the given outputs in other examples that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

- ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" corresponds to ""blue green green yellow blue red."" In this example, we once again see ""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""bluf,"" ""zup,"" and ""wif"" consistently corresponding to ""blue,"" ""green,"" ""green,"" ""yellow,"" and ""red,"" respectively.

- ""zup dax bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow green green."" Once more, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" to ""green.""

- ""zup dax lug"" corresponds to ""yellow green blue."" Here, ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" and ""lug"" with ""blue.""

From these examples, we can deduce that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we need to look for patterns in the input and the associated output colors. 

Let's analyze the given inputs and outputs:

1. wif walm zup -> red red red yellow
2. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue
3. lug dax wif -> blue green red
4. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
5. wif dax wif -> red green red

Notice the following:

- Every time the word ""wif"" occurs, the color ""red"" is included in the output.
- ""wif"" does not seem to directly influence the color associated with the following words since the same word can have different colors (""walm"" is red in the first input but blue in the second, and ""dax"" is green in the third input but also red in the fourth and fifth).

A potential pattern is that the word ""wif"" results in the color ""red."" However, we also notice that the number of colors in the output corresponds to the number of words in the input, which helps confirm that each word, including ""wif,"" corresponds to a color.

Rule: wif -> ""red""
Rule: zup -> yellow

Each time 'zup' appears as an input, the corresponding output is ""yellow."" Therefore, 'zup' translates to the color ""yellow.""
bluf -> repeat the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: When the word 'bluf' follows another word, it prompts the repetition of the color that corresponds to the previous word. In the provided examples, 'wif' corresponds to 'red', and 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'. The word 'dax' corresponds to 'green'.
Rule: The word ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the previous word in the input.

Here's how the rule applies to each output:

- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and ""walm"" indicates to repeat that color twice more.
  
- ""wif lug walm"" results in ""red blue blue blue"" because ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""lug"" to blue, and ""walm"" repeats the color for ""lug"" three times.
  
- ""zup dax walm"" gives ""yellow green green green"" because ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""dax"" to green, and ""walm"" repeats the green color three times.
  
- ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" results in ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"" because each word corresponds to a color, and ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow) three times before ending with ""lug,"" which is blue.
  
- ""zup wif walm"" results in ""yellow red red red"" because ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" to red, and ""walm"" repeats the red color three times.

walm -> To repeat the color of the previous word multiple times, dependent on some context of the preceding pattern.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it seems that each distinct word corresponds to a unique color. Here is the breakdown of each example and what we can deduce from it:

- In the first input, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The word ""walm"" also corresponds to ""blue,"" but since ""lug"" always translates to ""blue"" as well, ""walm"" might be context-dependent or simply another word for ""blue.""
- In the second input, there is no new information, but it reinforces that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""
- The third input does not introduce new words but further solidifies that ""lug"" is associated with the color ""blue,"" as ""lug bluf"" produces ""blue blue.""
- The fourth input adds the word ""wif,"" which consistently corresponds to ""red.""
- The fifth input again shows ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow."" Though ""walm"" is used here and results in ""yellow,"" it is more likely due to ""zup"" being repeated rather than ""walm"" having a different meaning since ""walm"" previously translated to ""blue.""

Therefore, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" across all examples. The rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the provided examples, one can induce the following relationship between the nonce word ""dax"" and its meaning:

- When ""dax"" appears on its own, the output is a single ""green"".
- When ""dax"" is combined with another nonce word (""walm""), the output is a number of ""green"" equal to the number of nonce words in the input sequence.
- When ""dax"" is combined with ""zup"" and ""walm"", it seems that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", as it precedes the ""green"" outputs and a ""yellow"" output appears at both ends of the sequence when ""zup"" is both at the start and the end. ""wif"" appears to translate to ""red"" at the end of the sequence.
- When ""dax"" follows ""zup"" (or vice versa), the same amount of ""yellow"" outputs appear as the number of times ""zup"" is present in the input sequence.
- When ""dax"" is combined with ""lug"", the output is ""blue"" followed by ""green"". 

Therefore, ""dax"" seems to consistently correspond to ""green"", regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. 

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the input-output pairs provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the word ""wif"" in this context.

Input: lug zup dax wif zup
Output: blue yellow green red yellow

Here, ""wif"" precedes ""zup,"" and the colors change from ""green"" to ""red"" when ""wif"" appears, followed again by ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

Here, ""wif"" precedes ""zup,"" which correlates to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" itself is translated as ""red.""

Input: wif lug bluf wif zup
Output: red blue blue red yellow

Once more, ""wif"" is followed by ""lug,"" which correlates to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" by itself is ""red.""

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

Again, ""wif"" precedes ""zup"" and correlates to ""red.""

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red

The presence of ""wif"" results in the word ""red"" being output.

By examining these examples, it seems that ""wif"" consistently correlates to the color ""red,"" regardless of what comes before or after it.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the given examples, the meaning of the word ""zup"" seems to correlate with the output ""yellow"". Additionally, when ""zup"" is combined with other words (e.g., ""lug"", ""wif"", ""walm""), it influences the output by repeating the color associated with the last word mentioned before ""zup"" appears. However, in the singular case where ""zup"" is present without any preceding word, its output is simply ""yellow"".

In the first example, ""dax zup dax zup wif"" generates ""green yellow green yellow red"". Each ""zup"" follows a ""dax"" and results in ""yellow"" after ""green"".

In the second example, ""zup"" by itself just generates ""yellow"".

In the third example, ""zup lug"" generates ""yellow blue""; ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"", and ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"".

In the fourth example, ""lug walm zup walm"" generates ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow"". Here, ""zup"" is placed after ""lug"" (blue) and ""walm"", but it causes a repetition of the color associated with ""walm"" (blue), resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow"".

In the fifth example, ""zup wif walm lug"" generates ""yellow red red red blue"". Again, ""zup"" is followed by ""wif"" and ""walm"", causing ""wif"" (red) to repeat before shifting to the color associated with ""walm"" (blue) after ""lug"" is mentioned.

Rule: zup -> yellow. When ""zup"" follows other words, it generates ""yellow"" and then repeats the color associated with the last mentioned word a number of times before changing to the next color associated with the following words. If ""zup"" appears without any preceding word, it alone corresponds to ""yellow"".
Observing the patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can infer the following for each word present:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color corresponding to the word right before it in the output (""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"")

The word ""bluf"" appears to correspond directly to the color ""blue,"" as it consistently maps to ""blue"" in every example, regardless of its position or the words around it.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is:

Rule: bluf -> blue
Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" could be as follows:

When ""walm"" follows another word, the output is three times the color associated with that word before reverting back to the color associated with ""walm,"" which is red.

By looking at the outputs, we can associate colors with certain words:
- ""lug"" has a color association of blue, since ""lug walm wif lug"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue.""
- ""wif"" has a color association of red, since ""lug wif walm"" translates to ""blue red red red.""
- ""dax"" has a color association of green, as seen in ""dax walm wif zup"" which translates to ""green green green red yellow.""
- ""zup"" has a color association of yellow, which can be inferred from the outputs ""zup walm"" being ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Therefore, when a word appears before ""walm,"" the output is three times the color of that preceding word, and the final color word is red (the color associated with ""wif""). When ""walm"" stands alone with a preceding word, the output is three times the color associated with that word without the red at the end, as seen in ""zup walm"" outputting ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times, and follow with the color red. If there is no succeeding word, do not add the color red at the end.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Considering the examples provided, we can observe the positioning and the corresponding output color for the nonce word ""dax"". Let's analyze each example:

1. dax bluf -> green green
2. zup walm lug zup wif dax -> yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
3. dax zup walm wif walm -> green yellow yellow yellow red red red
4. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
5. dax lug wif -> green blue red

Given these examples, we can establish a pattern for the word ""dax"":

- When ""dax"" appears at the beginning of the input, the first output is always ""green"".
- When ""dax"" appears at the end of the input, the corresponding output is ""green"".
- When ""dax"" appears in the middle, it contributes to an output that is ""red"" followed by ""green"".

From these observations, it seems that ""dax"" translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence; however, when it appears in the middle of a sequence, it is preceded by a ""red"".

Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" can be articulated as:

Rule: dax -> green. When ""dax"" is not at the beginning nor the end of the sequence, it is preceded by an additional ""red"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. 

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
The pattern in the examples provided suggests that the word ""bluf"" acts as a duplicator for the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. Here's the analysis:

- ""dax bluf"" yields ""green green"", indicating that ""bluf"" duplicates the color indicated by ""dax,"" which is green.
- ""zup bluf"" yields ""yellow yellow"", indicating that ""bluf"" duplicates the color indicated by ""zup,"" which is yellow.
- ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" yields ""green green red yellow red"", showing that ""bluf"" duplicated the color associated with ""dax"" (green) and the word ""wif"" preceded ""zup"" without being duplicated, though it still was represented by its color, red, both before and after ""zup"".
- ""wif bluf"" yields ""red red"", indicating that ""bluf"" duplicates the color indicated by ""wif,"" which is red.
- ""zup lug bluf"" yields ""yellow blue blue"", indicating that ""bluf"" again duplicates the color indicated by the closest preceding color word, which in this case is ""lug"" for blue.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it duplicates the color of the preceding color word, irrespective of the actual word representing that color.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the immediately preceding color word.
Observing the pattern:

- ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""zup dax walm lug wif"" corresponds to ""yellow green green green blue red""
- ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue""
- ""lug wif dax walm zup"" corresponds to ""blue red green green green yellow""
- ""wif walm dax zup"" corresponds to ""red red red green yellow""

Looking at these, it seems that ""walm"" means to repeat the color of the word directly before it three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug
    ",Output: green blue,green blue,True,137
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue."" No matter the context in which ""lug"" appears, it maintains the same translation.
From the given examples, each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. There is no indication that the meaning of ""dax"" is context-dependent or that it changes based on the words around it. Therefore, we can deduce that ""dax"" translates directly to the color ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, ""zup"" means yellow. 

The context doesn't seem to change the meaning of ""zup""; every time it appears in the input, the output consistently includes the color yellow. Other words in the examples appear to be associated with a specific color as well, for instance, ""lug"" seems consistently linked to blue, ""dax"" to green, and so on.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Analyzing the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word. Now, let's match the inputs with the outputs to identify patterns:

1. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and following ""bluf,"" it is repeated.

2. wif lug bluf -> red blue blue
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   Following ""bluf,"" the color associated with ""lug"" is repeated.

3. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" has no direct output, and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   Following ""bluf,"" the color associated with ""wif"" is repeated.

4. dax zup wif bluf lug -> green yellow red red blue
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" and so ""red"" is repeated.

5. wif dax bluf -> red green green
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   Following ""bluf,"" the color associated with ""dax"" is repeated.

Now, let's formulate the rule:

Rule:
bluf -> Causes the repetition of the color word associated with the immediately preceding word in the output sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" is not an object with a single constant color associated with it. Instead, ""walm"" causes the color of the previous word to repeat two more times. Here's the analysis for each input:

1. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" to red, ""bluf"" is a slight alteration of ""lug"" and still means blue.
   - The sequence ""lug wif walm lug"" translates to ""blue red red red blue"".

2. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   - Following the same logic, ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" makes ""red"" repeat, followed by ""lug bluf"" translating to ""blue blue"".

3. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   - Here, ""wif"" is red, ""bluf"" is a variant of ""blue"", and ""dax"" represents green. ""walm"" after ""dax"" makes ""green"" repeat twice.

4. Input: lug dax walm wif
   - ""lug"" is blue, ""dax"" is green, and after ""walm"" the color green repeats two more times, followed by ""wif"" which is red.

5. Input: dax walm
   - ""dax"" is green, and ""walm"" causes the color green to repeat two additional times.

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the previous word to repeat two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup dax
    ",Output: red yellow green,red yellow green,True,138
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following patterns:

- In all examples where ""dax"" appears, the output always contains ""green.""
- The word that appears immediately after ""dax"" dictates the number of times ""green"" appears in the output or its placement relative to other colors.

Analyzing the examples:

1. ""dax lug"" results in ""green blue,"" with ""green"" coming before ""blue.""
2. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" suggesting that ""walm"" translates to a repetition of ""green"" three times.
3. ""wif dax"" results in ""red green,"" indicating that ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green"" following it.
4. ""zup dax lug"" results in ""yellow green blue,"" where ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"" in that order.
5. ""lug dax"" results in ""blue green,"" where ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""dax"" follows as ""green.""

From these observations, the rule for ""dax"" appears to be that it translates to ""green."" The context of ""dax"" does not seem to affect its meaning as it consistently maps to ""green"" regardless of its position or the words around it.

Rule: dax -> green.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the usage in each example and its corresponding output:

1. Input: wif | Output: red
2. Input: zup lug walm wif dax | Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
3. Input: dax wif walm lug zup | Output: green red red red blue yellow
4. Input: zup bluf wif | Output: yellow yellow red
5. Input: zup wif | Output: yellow red

From the given examples, it can be observed that every single occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds directly to the output ""red."" There's no variation in the output tied to the context in which ""wif"" appears, which suggests that ""wif"" consistently maps to one meaning.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. There doesn't seem to be any context-dependent rule applying to ""zup"" as it consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words adjacent to it.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we will need to analyze the patterns surrounding its use in each example and how they correspond to the color outputs. 

Let's consider each example:

1. zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup:
   Input: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
   ""bluf"" appears twice, corresponding to ""blue blue"".

2. wif bluf dax walm:
   Input: red red green green green
   Here, ""bluf"" precedes a ""green"". 

3. wif lug bluf zup bluf dax:
   Input: red blue blue yellow yellow green
   Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""zup,"" both times yielding ""blue.""

4. zup wif bluf:
   Input: yellow red red
   ""bluf"" yields ""red"" here and is preceded by ""wif.""

5. dax bluf wif zup lug:
   Input: green green red yellow blue
   Here, ""bluf"" precedes ""wif,"" yielding ""green.""

We can notice that ""bluf"" does not always correspond to the same color output; instead, it seems to follow a rule based on its position and surrounding words. 

From examining the sequences:

- When ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output color is ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" or ""zup,"" the output color is ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" or preceded by ""lug,"" the output color is ""blue.""

Given these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" functions as a rule changer or color modifier based on the word that immediately follows it. This gives us a context-dependent meaning for ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> changes the next word's color output to a specific color based on a set pattern: followed by ""dax"" => green, followed by ""wif"" or ""zup"" => red, followed by ""lug"" or preceded by ""lug"" => blue.
Rule: walm -> the color that follows is repeated three times.

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""dax walm wif walm zup"" yields ""green green green red red red yellow."" Here, ""walm"" precedes the colors ""green"" and ""red,"" and each color is then repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""lug walm dax"" produces ""blue blue blue green."" Again, ""walm"" comes before ""green,"" and ""green"" is repeated three times.
- In the third example, ""lug walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue,"" with ""walm"" directly preceding ""yellow,"" which is then repeated three times.
- The fourth example, ""zup walm wif,"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow red."" Following the established pattern, ""walm"" precedes ""red,"" and ""red"" appears three times.
- Finally, the fifth example, ""dax walm zup,"" turns into ""green green green yellow,"" once again showing that ""walm"" leads to the subsequent color being said three times.

Based on these examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" signals the repetition of the color word that comes after it, exactly three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax wif dax
    ",Output: red green red green,red green red green,True,139
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Each instance of ""lug"" in the input is replaced with ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The term ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in each provided example, irrespective of its position in the sequence.
wif -> ""red""

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in each instance.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's align the inputs with their respective outputs in a structured manner:

1. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
2. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
3. dax zup walm wif -> green yellow yellow yellow red
4. wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue
5. lug wif lug walm zup walm wif -> blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

Looking at these inputs and outputs, it seems that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output.

By examining patterns, we can infer:
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" probably corresponds to ""blue,"" although it's only seen once.

Now let's focus on ""zup."" In the first example, ""zup"" is followed by all three colors corresponding to ""wif"" and ""lug,"" but starts with ""yellow,"" which leads us to believe that ""zup"" might correspond to ""yellow."" In the second example, when ""zup"" is at the end, the final output color is ""yellow,"" supporting the earlier deduction. The third example again shows ""zup"" followed by ""yellow."" The fourth and fifth examples, though more complex, do not contradict the previous observations that each appearance of ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.

After comparing all instances, we can establish the rule that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
To infer the meaning or rule for the word ""bluf,"" let's examine the associations between the inputs and outputs in the given examples:

- When the input ""dax bluf zup"" corresponds to the output ""green green yellow,"" we see ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" ""bluf"" leads to ""green"" again, and ""zup"" leads to ""yellow.""
- The input ""zup bluf"" results in the output ""yellow yellow,"" indicating that both ""zup"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""yellow.""
- For the input ""dax lug bluf,"" the output is ""green blue blue,"" suggesting that ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" with ""blue.""
- In the input ""zup bluf wif lug dax,"" corresponding to the output ""yellow yellow red blue green,"" ""zup"" matches ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" matches ""yellow,"" ""wif"" matches ""red,"" ""lug"" matches ""blue,"" and ""dax"" matches ""green.""
- Finally, the input ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" leads to the output ""red yellow yellow red green,"" where ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" with ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" with ""green.""

From these observations, we can notice the following:

- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" when following ""dax.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when following ""zup"" or when ""zup"" is in the input before ""bluf.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" when following ""lug.""

Given the inconsistency in the output colors for ""bluf,"" it seems that ""bluf"" does not have a fixed meaning or color association by itself but rather depends on its context within the input sequence.

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the immediately preceding word in the input sequence. If ""dax"" precedes it, then ""bluf"" equals ""green."" If ""zup"" precedes it, then ""bluf"" equals ""yellow."" If ""lug"" precedes it, then ""bluf"" equals ""blue."" Thus, the meaning of ""bluf"" is context-dependent and mimics the color output of the word that comes directly before it in the input sequence.
Rule: walm -> repeat of the previous color mentioned in the input sequence. 

To justify this rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. In ""zup wif lug zup walm,"" the sequence translates to ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""walm"" comes after ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" and indeed, ""walm"" translates to ""yellow,"" repeating the last color.

2. In ""zup dax lug walm zup,"" the sequence translates to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow."" ""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" and the output for ""walm"" is ""blue,"" repeating the last color.

3. ""Lug dax zup dax walm wif"" corresponds to ""blue green yellow green green green red."" After the second ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" ""walm"" also translates to ""green,"" again repeating the last color.

4. ""Zup wif walm"" gives ""yellow red red red."" Here, ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" corresponding to ""red,"" and the output is again repeating the last color, ""red.""

5. In ""dax walm wif zup,"" the sequence is ""green green green red yellow."" ""Walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" and the output is ""green"" for ""walm,"" repeating the last mentioned color.

Based on these examples, the rule for ""walm"" can be deduced as the repetition of the last mentioned color in the sequence. 

Hence: walm -> repeat of the previous color mentioned.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,140
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue"".
dax -> green. Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears, it translates to the color ""green.""
Rule: wif -> red

Each instance of the word ""wif"" in the examples given consistently translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sentence or the words around it.
Based on the given examples, ""zup"" seems to introduce a repetition of the color associated with the following word once more than it is typically represented. The word following ""zup"" is translated into its color form and then repeated one additional time than its standard count. Here's the breakdown:

- ""walm"" typically maps to ""yellow,""
- ""lug"" typically maps to ""blue,""
- ""bluf"" has not been defined in a non-zup context, but we can infer it maps to one ""yellow.""

""Zup"" appears to amplify the next word's output:

- ""lug walm zup walm"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow"" suggests ""zup walm"" added one more ""yellow"" to what would otherwise be ""blue blue yellow yellow.""
- ""lug zup lug"" -> ""blue yellow blue"" implies ""zup lug"" changed what would typically be just ""blue"" to ""yellow blue.""
- ""lug zup"" -> ""blue yellow"" again suggests ""zup"" caused the ""lug"" to output ""yellow"" instead of ""blue.""
- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"" points to ""zup"" introducing a triple ""yellow"" sequence for ""walm.""
- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"" implies a double ""yellow"" output for ""bluf.""

Note that there are multiple ways to interpret these examples, but the most consistent rule based on the available data seems to be:

zup -> causes the following word to repeat its corresponding color one additional time.

Rule: When ""zup"" precedes another word, output the color associated with the following word one additional time beyond its typical count. If the following word usually maps to one color, ""zup"" causes it to repeat once more, for a total of two. If the following word usually maps to two colors, ""zup"" causes it to repeat three times.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the relationship between the input and output in each example. 

- In the first item, ""zup bluf"" is translated to ""yellow yellow."" Here, both ""zup"" and ""bluf"" seem to correspond to ""yellow.""
- In the second item, ""zup wif bluf"" turns into ""yellow red red."" We've seen ""zup"" translate to ""yellow,"" and now ""wif"" is ""red."" The output for ""bluf"" remains ""yellow"" (from the first example), and the repetition of ""red"" suggests that ""bluf"" might share the output color with the word that precedes it.
- The third item, ""zup bluf wif walm,"" outputs ""yellow yellow red red red."" ""Zup"" is ""yellow,"" and since ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it is also ""yellow."" ""Wif"" is consistently ""red,"" and ""walm,"" while new, seems to repeat the color of the preceding word.
- In the fourth item, ""lug wif lug bluf"" becomes ""blue red blue blue."" So ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf,"" which is preceded by ""lug,"" also translates to ""blue.""
- In the fifth item, ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" translates to ""red red blue green red."" Here, ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and thus is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""dax"" is a new word that outputs ""green."" The last ""wif"" remains ""red.""

From this, we can see that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word right before it. If there is no word before it (which does not happen in the given examples), we would not be able to deduce its meaning from the given data.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word that precedes it. If there's no preceding word, its behavior is undefined within the given dataset.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can look at the patterns in which it appears and the associated outputs:

1. wif dax lug walm -> red green blue blue blue
2. lug dax walm -> blue green green green
3. lug walm zup -> blue blue blue yellow
4. dax walm -> green green green
5. dax walm -> green green green

It appears that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color word that precedes it:

- Example 1: ""lug"" means blue, and after ""walm"" we get two more ""blue.""
- Example 2: ""dax"" means green, and after ""walm"" we get two more ""green.""
- Example 3: ""lug"" means blue, and after ""walm"" we get two more ""blue."" The pattern breaks with ""zup,"" which means yellow.
- Examples 4 and 5: ""dax"" means green, and after ""walm"" the output is two ""green.""

Based on the observed pattern, ""walm"" seems to mean repetition of the color word that comes before it. Specifically, it results in the color word being repeated twice more.

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color word to be repeated two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,141
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is a stand-in for the color blue in every given example.
dax -> green

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" 

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's examine its role in each input/output sequence:

1. ""dax walm zup"" -> ""green green green yellow""
2. ""zup wif zup"" -> ""yellow red yellow""
3. ""dax bluf wif zup"" -> ""green green red yellow""
4. ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue""
5. ""zup bluf dax"" -> ""yellow yellow green""

Observations:
- When ""zup"" follows ""dax"" or ""bluf,"" the output for ""zup"" is yellow. However, when it follows ""wif"" or ""walm,"" the output changes.
- It seems that the output color for ""zup"" is not fixed but depends on the word that comes before it.
- ""zup"" never produces output colors like blue or green; it only results in yellow or red.

Based on these observations, we can try to discern a rule. One possibility is that ""zup"" takes on a color based on the word that precedes it, with the potential to turn yellow in case it's preceded by certain words, or red in other specific cases as shown in the second input/output.

Let's refine the rule based on the information above:

- If ""zup"" follows ""dax"" or ""bluf,"" the output for ""zup"" is yellow.
- If ""zup"" follows ""wif,"" the output for ""zup"" is red.

It appears that ""zup"" changes color when preceded by different words, and the two observed colors for ""zup"" are yellow and red.

However, there is insufficient data to determine why ""zup"" is red after ""wif,"" as this only occurs once, and we have no other examples to compare. The same goes for why ""zup"" is yellow after other words; there's only one instance with ""wif"" preceding ""zup,"" and it turns yellow in all other cases.

Given the limited data, the best we can determine with the information at hand is a rule that describes the output color of ""zup"" given the word that precedes it. So with the above data, the tentative rule would be:

Rule: If ""zup"" is preceded by ""dax"" or ""bluf,"" it results in yellow; if it is preceded by ""wif,"" it results in red. For other preceding words or scenarios, additional data would be needed to determine the rule.
By examining the examples provided and the pattern in which colors are assigned to the inputs, we can infer the following:

- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" and/or followed by ""lug"", it translates to ""blue"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", it translates to ""yellow"".
- When ""bluf"" is the only word or follows ""wif"", it translates to ""red"".

However, in every example, ""bluf"" always corresponds to one color, which is the color that appears immediately after the first color every time ""bluf"" is used. Here's a breakdown:

1. ""zup dax bluf"" results in ""yellow green green"" - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"", the color right after ""yellow"".
2. ""dax lug bluf wif"" results in ""green blue blue red"" - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"", the color right after ""green"".
3. ""dax lug bluf"" results in ""green blue blue"" - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"", the color right after ""green"".
4. ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"" - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"", the same color that precedes it.
5. ""zup bluf lug dax lug"" results in ""yellow yellow blue green blue"" - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"", the color immediately preceding it.

From these observations, the rule can be summarized as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that comes immediately before it in the sequence.

Hence, the rule for ""bluf"" can be deduced as:
bluf -> Take on the color that directly precedes it in the sequence. If there is no preceding color, take on the color ""red"".
Based on the examples given, we can deduce the following:

- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"".
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"".
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"".

However, ""walm"" consistently results in a repetition of the color word for the word that precedes it (except when ""walm"" is the first word, which is not exemplified). Here is the analysis:

- ""wif zup bluf lug walm"": The word before ""walm"" is ""lug"", which translates to ""blue"", resulting in three additional ""blue"".
- ""wif lug walm"": ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", causing a repetition of ""blue"".
- ""dax lug walm"": Here, ""lug"" again precedes ""walm"", leading to repeated ""blue"".
- ""zup walm dax lug"": ""zup"" precedes ""walm"", causing a repetition of ""yellow"".
- ""wif walm"": ""wif"" precedes ""walm"", resulting in repeated ""red"".

Therefore: walm -> meaning. Rule: ""Walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three additional times. If ""walm"" is the initial word, the output is three repetitions of the color associated with the word itself. However, since we do not have an example of ""walm"" as the initial word, the rule for this specific scenario is assumed based on the pattern of repetition in other examples and may not be definitive without additional context or examples.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug zup
    ",Output: green blue yellow,green blue yellow,True,142
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output. The other words seem to have their own color assignments (e.g., ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""walm"" also seems to repeat the color ""blue"" three times). There's no indication that ""lug"" changes meaning based on context or order in the sequence.

Rule:
lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs. 

Here are the examples that show the correlation:

- Input: wif dax zup dax -> Output: red green yellow green
- Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green
- Input: zup bluf lug dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow blue green blue
- Input: dax zup dax -> Output: green yellow green
- Input: dax lug -> Output: green blue

In each of these examples, the occurrence of ""dax"" in the input directly translates to ""green"" in the output, irrespective of the context or position.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, we'll analyze the output of each input where the word ""wif"" appears and deduce its meaning.

1. Input: wif
   Output: red
   - Here, ""wif"" alone corresponds to ""red.""

2. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   - The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" while ""lug"" appears to correspond to ""blue"" given the instances before and after ""wif.""

3. Input: dax zup lug wif lug
   Output: green yellow blue red blue
   - Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" The words ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug"" correspond to ""green,"" ""yellow,"" and ""blue,"" respectively.

4. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   - In this case, ""wif"" is surrounded by the words ""dax"" and ""walm,"" which is translated to ""green red."" Notice that ""walm"" appears in other contexts to mean a sequence of ""red,"" and ""wif"" seems to have retained the meaning of ""red"" from the previous examples.

5. Input: wif zup dax bluf
   Output: red yellow green green
   - Once again, ""wif"" translates to ""red."" ""Zup"" and ""dax"" correspond to ""yellow"" and ""green,"" respectively.

Given all examples, we can distill the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red

The meaning of ""wif"" appears to consistently translate to the word ""red,"" regardless of the context it is in within the provided examples.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Each instance of the nonce word ""zup"" in the inputs corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the outputs.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns before and after each occurrence of ""bluf"" within the examples given.

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" is preceded by a list of elements having corresponding colors. Notably, ""bluf"" has a double output ""red red.""
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" is also the last element and again results in ""blue blue.""
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" appears second in the sequence and yields a single ""yellow.""
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" yields ""red red,"" and it's at the end of the sequence.
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" yields ""red red"" once more and is in the middle of the sequence.

Let's analyze the correlations:
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" but when ""bluf"" follows it, it seems that ""red"" is duplicated.
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Based on the examples, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be connected to duplicating the color immediately preceding it, except when ""zup"" precedes it, where the output becomes ""yellow"" instead.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color output of the preceding word unless the preceding word corresponds to ""yellow"" (in the case of ""zup""), in which case ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color directly preceding it in the sequence. Here is the analysis per example:

1. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, and ""walm"" duplicates this color thrice.

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, and ""walm"" duplicates this color thrice.

3. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" duplicates the yellow color thrice before the final ""lug"" returns to blue.

4. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" duplicates the green color thrice with ""zup"" returning to yellow and ""wif"" to red after ""walm"".

5. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""walm"" duplicates this green color thrice, followed by ""wif"" corresponding to red and ""bluf"" possibly corresponding to the red color repeated.

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times.

Walm -> The color of the preceding word is repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup walm
    ",Output: green yellow yellow yellow,green yellow yellow yellow,True,143
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" we need to identify the pattern of translation between the inputs and outputs in the provided examples.

From the examples:
1. ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue.""
2. ""zup walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red.""
3. ""wif lug dax"" translates to ""red blue green.""
4. ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow.""
5. ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue.""

The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in each example it appears. No matter its position in the input sentence, ""lug"" consistently results in ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue.
The rule seems to be that each word corresponds to a specific color. Based on the examples given, here is the correspondence:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- bluf -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow

Rule: Each nonce word is associated with a specific color. The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's look at the examples given and identify the pattern:

- When ""wif"" appears, the output word is always ""red.""
- Regardless of its position in the input sequence, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""

Now let's confirm this rule with each example:

1. Input: wif bluf lug -> Output: red red blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red""

2. Input: dax lug wif -> Output: green blue red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to the last ""red""

3. Input: zup wif zup -> Output: yellow red yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to the middle ""red""

4. Input: zup dax zup wif -> Output: yellow green yellow red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to the last ""red""

5. Input: zup wif dax walm -> Output: yellow red green green green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to the second word ""red""

Every instance confirms the rule that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence, and the presence of other words does not seem to affect its meaning.

The rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
From the given examples, we can deduce the rule by comparing the inputs and the corresponding outputs, focusing on the position and occurrence of the word ""bluf"" and its associated colors in the outputs:

1. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
2. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
3. zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red
4. lug zup bluf dax -> blue yellow yellow green
5. dax bluf wif zup lug -> green green red yellow blue

By examining the above examples, we can see that the word that appears immediately after ""bluf"" is doubled in color in the output. In the first, second, and fourth examples, ""bluf"" is the last or second-to-last word, and the color that appears last or second-to-last is doubled (""yellow"" in the first and second, ""green"" in the fourth). In the third and fifth examples, the color that comes after ""bluf"" is the one that's doubled (""red"" is after ""bluf"" and repeated in the output in the third example, and ""red"" is the color for ""wif"" which follows ""bluf"" and is doubled in the fifth example).

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" indicates that the color of the next word in the input should be repeated in the output sequence. If ""bluf"" is at the end or there is no next item, the color of the last item is repeated.

Rule: bluf -> Duplicate the color of the following word in the output. If there is no following word, duplicate the last color.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in the given examples.

1. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green
2. wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif -> red red green green red red red blue red
3. zup walm dax -> yellow yellow yellow green
4. dax walm -> green green green
5. wif walm zup walm -> red red red yellow yellow yellow

Let's first confirm the color association for the other words based on their repetition and resulting color:

- lug is associated with blue.
- wif is associated with red.
- zup is associated with yellow.
- dax is associated with green.

Now focusing on ""walm"":

- In example 1, walm is preceded by lug (which outputs blue), and the sequence following walm is all blue until dax changes the color to green.
- In example 2, walm follows wif (which outputs red) and precedes lug. The color output after walm is blue, which is the color associated with lug, so there is a transition here.
- In example 3, walm is preceded by zup and followed by dax. The colors turn from yellow (associated with zup) to green (associated with dax)
- In example 4, walm follows dax, and there is no change in color; it remains green.
- In example 5, walm is surrounded by wif and zup, and the colors change from red to yellow accordingly.

Based on these observations, ""walm"" appears to repeat the color of the word before it until a different color word is encountered. It does not seem to have its own color but rather extends the sequence of the preceding color. 

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word until a different color word appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,144
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Every occurrence of ""dax"" in the input results in ""green"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the patterns associated with each occurrence of the word in the provided examples:

- In the first input ""lug wif dax walm zup,"" the word ""wif"" is followed by different words and the respective colors for those words seem to be ""blue red green green green yellow."" Since ""wif"" precedes ""dax"" and the color output is ""red green,"" we can hypothesize that ""wif"" might be associated with the color red.

- In the second input ""zup wif walm,"" the word ""wif"" is again followed by ""walm,"" and the output is ""yellow red red red."" This supports the hypothesis that ""wif"" is associated with the color red, as the output after ""wif"" starts with red.

- The third input ""zup dax lug wif dax"" confirms that after ""wif,"" the output color starts with red, followed by the color associated with the next word, ""dax,"" which is green.

- In the fourth input ""wif bluf lug,"" the output after ""wif"" begins with red, followed by red for ""bluf"" and blue for ""lug.""

- The last example, ""wif lug zup walm wif lug,"" further supports the pattern, where each occurrence of ""wif"" is followed by the color red in the output sequence.

Considering the pattern across all examples, we can induce that ""wif"" directly translates to the color red, regardless of the words that follow it.

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in each example provided.
Considering the provided examples, let's examine the pattern between the inputs and the corresponding outputs:

1. ""dax lug wif bluf"" -> ""green blue red red""
2. ""dax bluf wif"" -> ""green green red""
3. ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue""
4. ""zup lug bluf"" -> ""yellow blue blue""
5. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red""

Analyzing these examples:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the color ""green"" is repeated.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the color ""yellow"" is repeated.
- Regardless of the word that comes after ""bluf,"" it doesn't seem to affect the repetition rule above.

From this, we can deduce that ""bluf"" causes repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> causes the color word immediately before it to repeat.
Observing the examples given, it seems that the word ""walm"" correlates with repetition. The repetition is of the color that is outputted immediately before ""walm"" is mentioned. Here are the observations in detail:

1. In the first example, ""zup"" produces ""yellow,"" and then ""walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating a triplication of the preceding color.

2. In the second example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output is ""yellow"" before ""walm,"" followed by ""yellow yellow yellow.""

3. In the third example, ""wif"" precedes the first ""walm,"" and the output is ""red"" followed by ""red red red,"" which again indicates a triplication.

4. In the fourth example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and the pattern continues with ""green"" followed by ""green green green.""

5. In the fifth example, ""zup dax walm,"" has the output of ""yellow green green green,"" indicating that ""dax"" and its resulting color ""green"" are triplicated, and ""zup"" output is not affected by ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule pertaining to ""walm"" appears to be the triplication of the color output that directly precedes the word ""walm.""

walm -> meaning. Rule: When ""walm"" appears after a color word, it causes the output of the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup
    ",Output: blue yellow,blue yellow,True,145
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Given the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" is consistently translated to ""blue"" in every case. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

lug -> meaning. Meaning: ""lug"" means ""blue"".

Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
Analyzing the given examples, it seems that each word is associated with a specific color except for ""dax."" The word ""dax"" appears to take on the color that directly follows it in sequence. Here is how the association works based on the examples:

- wif -> red
- bluf -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> blue (based on the last example, as ""walm"" precedes ""dax lug"" and the sequence is ""blue blue"")

By examining the sequences where ""dax"" appears, we can determine that ""dax"" assumes the color of the next word:

1. wif bluf dax -> red red green (dax takes the color green from the following word ""bluf"")
2. dax lug dax lug wif -> green blue green blue red (dax alternates between green and blue, as the corresponding word after each instance of dax is either ""lug"" for blue or ""bluf"" for green)
3. zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
   (dax assumes the color green from the following word ""bluf"")
4. zup dax lug -> yellow green blue (dax takes on the color blue from ""lug"")
5. wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue (dax takes the color green from the subsequent word ""lug"")

Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" is that it assumes the color of the word that follows it.

Rule: dax -> takes on the color of the following word.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we should look for patterns in the input and output pairs provided.

1. Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. This happens regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input sentence.
2. Similarly, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""
3. The order of words in the input matches the order of colors in the output. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the words and colors in the sequence they are given.
4. The word ""walm"" after ""wif"" did not seem to influence the color output for ""wif,"" which remains ""red."" Following the pattern, it is likely that ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" as well but it hasn't been stated in the provided examples.

Based on these observations, the rule can be defined as follows:

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, 'zup' consistently translates to the color 'yellow'. There are no variations in output tied to the position of 'zup' within the input sequence, so we can conclude that 'zup' always corresponds to the same color, regardless of context within the sequence. 

Therefore, the rule is: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"", we need to assess its context within the given examples. Let's analyze each instance:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" and ""wif zup"" results in ""red yellow."" Since ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"" when it follows ""bluf,"" we can infer that ""bluf"" does not affect the color associated with ""zup."" However, when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" as in ""wif bluf,"" the color is ""red red,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" echoes the color of the word before it.

- The second example is straightforward: ""dax bluf"" directly translates to ""green green,"" where ""bluf"" echoes the color of ""dax.""

- The third example, ""wif bluf lug,"" translates to ""red red blue."" Here, ""bluf"" is again echoing the color of ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

- The fourth example, ""zup wif dax wif bluf,"" maps to ""yellow red green red red."" In this sequence, ""bluf"" follows the second ""wif"" and results in ""red,"" echoing the color of ""wif"" once more.

- The fifth example, ""dax lug wif bluf,"" results in ""green blue red red."" Again, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red,"" which is the color of ""wif.""

From these examples, it becomes apparent that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately preceding it. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is as follows:

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the word directly before it.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the subsequent word to repeat its output color an additional two times. Thus, when ""walm"" follows a word, the color associated with that word is outputted three times in total.

Here are the rules derived from the examples:

1. lug -> blue
2. dax -> green
3. wif -> red
4. zup -> yellow
5. walm following any color word -> repeat the color of that word two more times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: When 'walm' follows a color word, the output color of the preceding color word is repeated two additional times, making for a total of three sequential appearances of that color in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup bluf
    ",Output: red red yellow,red yellow yellow,False,146
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the given examples, ""lug"" consistently produces the output ""blue"", regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words around it.

Rule: lug means blue.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following mappings from the input words to the output colors:

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> green (although bluf is not explicitly defined, its meaning can be inferred from the second and third examples)
- dax -> green

Given this pattern, we can determine that the word 'dax' maps to the color 'green'. Therefore, our rule is:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following pattern:

- Whenever the word ""wif"" is present in an input, the word ""red"" is present in the corresponding output.
- The position of ""wif"" in the input does not affect its corresponding output; ""wif"" always translates to ""red,"" regardless of whether ""wif"" appears at the beginning, middle, or end of the input sequence.

Let's look at each example to see how ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"":

- Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue (Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"")
- Input: lug dax wif -> Output: blue green red (Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"")
- Input: wif -> Output: red (""wif"" stands alone and corresponds to ""red"")
- Input: zup wif dax walm -> Output: yellow red green green green (Here, ""wif"" is in the middle and corresponds to ""red"")
- Input: dax wif -> Output: green red (""wif"" is at the end and corresponds to ""red"")

Using this analysis, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif -> ""red"" (In any sequence where ""wif"" appears, it translates to the word ""red"".)
Based on the provided examples, it seems that 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow.' Each time 'zup' appears in the input, the term 'yellow' appears in the same position in the output. Meanwhile, other words like 'dax,' 'bluf,' and 'wif' correspond to 'green,' 'green yellow,' and 'red,' respectively. Since 'zup' is consistently translated to 'yellow' regardless of its position amongst other words or what those other words are, it can be deduced that 'zup' strictly means 'yellow.'

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" when it precedes a word that translates to ""green"" and to the color ""blue"" when it precedes a word that translates to a color other than ""green"". However, there's one inconsistency with the third example (""zup wif bluf zup lug"") where ""bluf"" is followed by a word that translates to ""yellow"" but the output for ""bluf"" is ""red"" instead of ""blue"". This could potentially indicate an error in the examples or additional complexity in the rules governing ""bluf"".

Given the information and assuming there aren't mistakes in the examples, a tentative rule is as follows:

Rule: If ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" (which means ""green""), then ""bluf"" means ""red"". In all other cases, ""bluf"" means ""blue"".
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look at the patterns in the input and the corresponding colors in the output.

Examining the outputs, we can see that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color that immediately precedes it. Here's how it works with each example given:

- In the first example, ""lug walm wif"" outputs ""blue blue blue red."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" we see ""blue"" repeated three times, which suggests ""walm"" causes the preceding color to be repeated three times.

- In the second example, ""lug zup walm lug"" outputs ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" we see ""yellow"" repeated three times again. This supports the earlier observation.

- In the third example, ""lug wif walm"" outputs ""blue red red red."" The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" there are three ""red"" instances.

- The fourth example, ""wif walm,"" results in ""red red red."" After ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated three times.

- Finally, in the fifth example, ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green."" The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated three times.

Based on these examples, the rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the preceding color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif walm
    ",Output: red red red,red red red,True,147
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the given examples. Each instance of ""lug"" in the inputs is translated to ""blue"" in the outputs.
From the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" is associated with a specific color output in the sequence. To delineate the rule, let's analyze the patterns across different inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. ""zup dax bluf zup dax"" corresponds to ""yellow green green yellow green""
2. ""lug dax lug"" corresponds to ""blue green blue""
3. ""dax wif"" corresponds to ""green red""
4. ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green""
5. ""dax lug wif"" corresponds to ""green blue red""

Looking at the outputs, every time the word ""dax"" is used in the input, the color ""green"" is outputted. Thus, irrespective of the context or position within the sequence, ""dax"" seems directly translated into the color ""green"". Further, the other words correspond to specific colors and the sequence of colors matches the sequence of words, with each word consistently mapping to a specific color.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green

Meaning: ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
To determine the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""wif,"" we need to assess the patterns and correlations between each instance of ""wif"" and its resulting output, considering all the examples provided. 

In the first example, ""wif zup"" leads to ""red yellow."" If we consider ""zup"" translating to ""yellow,"" then maybe ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" as it appears first in both the input and output sequences.

In the second example, ""dax wif"" leads to ""green red."" ""Dax"" might translate to ""green,"" leaving ""wif"" to potentially be ""red"" again, similar to our first example.

In the third example, ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" corresponds to ""red red blue green red."" Here, ""wif"" appears twice and correspondingly ""red"" appears twice as well, once at the beginning and once at the end, framing the output. ""Dax"" appears once and aligns with ""green,"" bolstering our previous association of ""dax"" with ""green.""

In the fourth example, ""zup wif zup"" leads to ""yellow red yellow,"" which supports our earlier associations: ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" is ""red.""

In the fifth example, ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red."" The output is solely consisting of ""red,"" which means ""walm"" somehow also results in ""red,"" but importantly ""wif"" preceding it doesn't change its own representation as ""red.""

From these examples, we can deduce that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position or the words that follow.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color:

- ""zup"" is consistently translated to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" when it is not the first word, translates to ""red""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""bluf"" when used once translates to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" translates to ""blue""

However, we should note that there seems to be a pattern where ""wif"" changes to ""red"" only when it is not the first word in the sequence. When ""wif"" is the first word, it does not appear in the outputs, suggesting that ""wif"" at the start could function as a word that does not translate or is omitted.

From the information provided, we can state the following rule for ""zup"":

Rule: zup -> yellow
Bluf -> the word ""bluf"" refers to repeating the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it twice in the output.

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a word, the corresponding color of that word is produced two times in sequence in the output. For instance, ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"" because the color associated with ""wif"" is red and is repeated twice. Similarly, ""lug wif bluf"" results in ""blue red red"" because ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and then the ""wif bluf"" part translates to ""red red"".
Based on the examples provided, the output is a sequence of colored words (""yellow,"" ""red,"" ""blue"") that correspond to the words in the input. Each input word seems to generate a specific output color repeated a certain number of times. The examples seem consistent in that ""zup"" generates ""yellow,"" ""wif"" generates ""red,"" and ""lug"" generates ""blue"" colors, and each is repeated three times.

Within these sequences, the word ""walm"" appears, and following the instances where ""walm"" is in the input, there are repetitions of colors in the output. Observing each case:

1. ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" following ""zup"" leads to a repetition of ""zup's"" output color.

2. ""wif walm zup"" leads to ""red red red yellow,"" showcasing that ""walm"" repeated the color associated with the word before it (""wif"").

3. ""lug walm zup walm"" gives ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow,"" reinforcing the idea that ""walm"" is repeating the color output related to the word preceding it.

4. ""lug wif walm"" outputs ""blue red red red,"" aligning with the notion that ""walm"" duplicates the output of ""wif.""

5. ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" creates a pattern, ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow,"" where each ""walm"" follows the pattern already established.

Based on these observations, it seems that the word ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color output associated with the word that precedes it.

Rule: walm -> Causes the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif
    ",Output: green red,green red,True,148
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the word ""lug"" is associated with the color ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, the color blue appears in the output. Here is the rule based on the examples given:

Rule: lug -> blue
Through the provided examples, we can attempt to induce the rule governing the meaning of the nonce word ""dax.""

Let's look at each usage of ""dax"" and its corresponding color:

1. dax walm zup lug dax -> green green green yellow blue green
2. dax lug wif -> green blue red
3. wif walm dax -> red red red green
4. zup dax -> yellow green
5. dax walm -> green green green

From these examples, whenever the word ""dax"" is used, it is translated to the color ""green."" This is consistent across all examples provided. Additionally, no context is given where ""dax"" does not translate to ""green."" 

Therefore, the rule we can induce is:

dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. Here is how it works for each example:

- ""lug wif dax"" translates to ""blue red green.""
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red.""
- ""zup bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow red.""
- ""dax lug wif lug"" translates to ""green blue red blue.""
- ""zup lug bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue blue red.""

Every instance of ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Thus, the rule is:

wif -> red.
Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" translates to a repetition of the previous color word in the output. See how this pattern holds in the examples provided:

1. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue
   (The word ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" and thus ""bluf"" results in another ""blue."")

2. dax zup lug zup bluf -> green yellow blue yellow yellow
   (The word ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" and thus ""bluf"" results in another ""yellow."")

3. dax bluf -> green green
   (The word ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which translates to ""green,"" and thus ""bluf"" results in another ""green."")

4. lug bluf -> blue blue
   (The word ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" and thus ""bluf"" results in another ""blue."")

5. zup dax zup dax wif bluf -> yellow green yellow green red red
   (The word ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which translates to ""red,"" and thus ""bluf"" results in another ""red."")

Given this pattern, the rule for ""bluf"" can be defined as follows:

Rule: bluf -> the word ""bluf"" means to repeat the color word that immediately precedes it.
walm -> meaning. Meaning is to repeat the color associated with the previous word thrice.

Rule:
When the word ""walm"" follows another word, it instructs to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times. For example:
- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow"" because the color associated with ""zup"" is yellow, and ""walm"" means to repeat that color thrice.
- ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red"" because the color associated with ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" means to repeat that color thrice.
- ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green"" because the color associated with ""dax"" is green, and ""walm"" means to repeat that color thrice.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word 'lug' is seen in the input, it translates to the color 'blue' in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it is possible to induce that the word ""dax"" is consistently translated to the color ""green"". Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the same position in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, each word seems to correspond to a specific color. The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in every example given.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""zup"" correlates consistently with a specific color:

1. When ""zup"" appears alone or is followed by another word, it results in ""yellow"" being in the output. The color after ""yellow"" corresponds to the word after ""zup."" Example: ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""walm"" doesn't seem to correspond with a specific color, but ""zup"" definitely corresponds with ""yellow.""

2. When ""zup"" is preceded by another word, the color corresponding to that word is listed before ""yellow."" Examples:
   - ""wif zup"" -> ""red yellow"" (""wif"" -> ""red"")
   - ""lug zup"" -> ""blue yellow"" (""lug"" -> ""blue"")

3. When ""zup"" is both preceded and followed by another word, the sequence of colors reflects the sequence of words. Example: ""zup wif zup"" -> ""yellow red yellow.""

Rule: zup corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" and when it precedes or follows a word representing a different color, it maintains its color assignment. The placement of ""zup"" within the sequence of words will determine where ""yellow"" appears in the sequence of colors in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" leads to the output of a color word repeated one or more times. The number of repetitions and the specific color produced are influenced by the preceding word(s):

1. ""lug"" before ""bluf"" leads to ""blue"" being output twice.
2. ""lug"" followed by ""wif"" before ""bluf"" changes the output color to ""red"" and is also output twice.
3. ""wif"" followed by ""zup"" before ""bluf"" gives ""yellow"" twice, then followed by ""lug"" it results in ""blue"" being repeated thrice, one additional time than the usual pattern for ""lug bluf"".
4. ""dax"" before ""bluf"" results in ""green"" being output twice.

Observing this pattern, it's possible that the word before ""bluf"" determines the color, while the repetition rule seems to be the following:
- The default repetition is twice.
- If ""wif"" is present before ""bluf"", it appears to add an extra instance of ""red"" to the output.
- If ""lug"" is present before ""bluf"", without ""wif"" influencing the output, it yields two times ""blue"".
- If ""dax"" is present, it results in two times ""green"".
- If ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and is followed by ""lug"", it seems to be associated with yellow and influences the blue repetitions to increase.

There isn't enough information to determine a consistent rule for how many repetitions are caused by ""zup"" and ""walm,"" but it's clear that they work in conjunction with the words that precede ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> Output a color word, determined by the word immediately preceding ""bluf,"" repeated a number of times based on the combination of words present before ""bluf.""
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we'll look at the patterns of the input and corresponding output colors.

- When ""lug"" appears, we see ""blue,""
- When ""wif"" appears, we see ""red,""
- When ""dax"" appears, we see ""green,""
- When ""zup"" appears, we see ""yellow.""

Now let's look at the occurrences of ""walm"" and the context they are used in:

1. ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red""
2. ""wif lug dax walm"" -> ""red blue green green green""
3. ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green green green red""
4. ""dax walm wif dax"" -> ""green green green red green""
5. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" -> ""green green green yellow blue blue blue""

From the above, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it, repeating as many times as the order number of that word. For example:

- In the first example, ""wif"" is the second word before ""walm,"" so ""red"" is outputted twice (the output is ""blue red red red"").
- In the second example, ""dax"" is the third word before ""walm,"" so ""green"" is outputted three times (the output is ""red blue green green green"").
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" is the fourth word before the second ""walm,"" so ""blue"" is outputted four times (the output is ""green green green yellow blue blue blue"").

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" can be stated as:

Rule: ""walm"" -> It outputs the color corresponding to the word immediately before it, repeated as many times as the position of that word.

Using this rule, ""walm"" itself does not have a standalone meaning but modifies the output based on its preceding word and position in the input sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    ",Output: blue green,blue green,True,150
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" we need to compare the output colors for each input. Let's analyze each input and its corresponding output in the order given:

1. ""zup walm dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green blue""
   In this sequence, ""lug"" is followed by a unique ""blue,"" while the other words result in ""yellow"" or ""green.""

2. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" -> ""blue red yellow red red red""
   Here, ""lug"" appears first and is translated as ""blue."" The word ""wif"" that follows is ""red,"" while ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

3. ""zup lug walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue""
   ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" Following ""lug,"" ""walm"" is also ""blue.""

4. ""zup bluf lug"" -> ""yellow yellow blue""
   ""zup"" is consistent with ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" here gives us ""yellow."" After the word ""lug,"" no additional words affect the output.

5. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow""
   ""zup"" remains ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and the sequence following ""lug"" is all yellow.

From these examples, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue."" However, there seems to be no effect from the words that follow ""lug."" The rule seems that ""lug"" is an independent variable unaffected by its position in the sequence or the words around it. 

Rule: lug -> blue. ""Lug"" always translates to the color blue, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words.
From the given examples, it seems that each word following ""dax"" is associated with a particular color. The word ""dax"" itself generates a ""green"" output every time it appears. Based on the examples provided:

Input: dax bluf wif
Output: green green red
- ""dax"" corresponds with the first ""green""
- ""bluf"" corresponds with the second ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds with ""red""

Input: dax
Output: green
- ""dax"" corresponds with ""green""

Input: dax bluf zup
Output: green green yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds with the first ""green""
- ""bluf"" corresponds with the second ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow""

Input: dax lug
Output: green blue
- ""dax"" corresponds with ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue""

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
- ""dax"" corresponds with the first ""green""
- ""walm"" corresponds with the second ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds again with ""red""

Based on the examples, a potential rule seems to be that ""dax"" is a code word or trigger for the color green, always resulting in ""green"" every time it is encountered. However, the meanings of other words seem to be consistent (""bluf"" always gives green, ""wif"" always gives red, etc.), suggesting that those words might be coded for specific colors as well.

Rule:
- dax always corresponds to the color green
- Other words following ""dax"" appear to correspond to their own specific colors.
Rule: wif -> red

Each occurrence of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to a single ""red"" in the output. This pattern remains consistent across all examples.
zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the color ""yellow"" is included in the output. It seems to have a one-to-one correspondence regardless of its position or the context with other words.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color indicated by the word that precedes it. In each example, the color after ""bluf"" is a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word just before it.

Let's analyze the examples one by one:

1. ""zup dax bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow green green"" — Here ""bluf"" takes the color green, which is the color associated with ""dax.""

2. ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red"" — Here ""bluf"" takes the color red, which is the color corresponding to ""wif.""

3. ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" corresponds to ""green yellow blue yellow yellow"" — Here ""bluf"" takes the color yellow, which is the color corresponding to the word ""zup"" that comes just before it.

4. ""lug bluf zup lug"" corresponds to ""blue blue yellow blue"" — Here ""bluf"" takes the color blue, which is the color corresponding to the word ""lug"" that comes just before it.

5. ""wif bluf lug"" corresponds to ""red red blue"" — Here again, ""bluf"" takes the color red, which is the color associated with ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes the color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> Takes the color of the word immediately before it.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the instances where it occurs alongside the output.

Here's what we have:

1. When ""dax"" occurs, the output is ""green"". This is consistent across all examples given.
2. ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" when it occurs right after ""walm"" (Example 1 and 5) but ""yellow"" alone when standing alone (Example 2).
3. ""wif"" leads to ""red"" when it either occurs consecutively (Example 5) or stands alone (Example 2 and 3). It also results in ""green red red"" sequence when followed by unique words, as seen in Example 4.
4. ""lug"" consistently gives us ""blue blue"" when followed by ""walm,"" and ""blue"" alone when standing alone (Example 2 and 3).
5. When ""bluf"" occurs, the output is either ""yellow"" (Example 2) or ""red"" (Example 4).

Now, consider ""walm"" in these contexts:

- In Example 1, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the sequence results in three ""green"" output, then a ""yellow.""
- In Example 2, ""walm"" is the last of five words, and the output ends with three ""blue.""
- In Example 3, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in ""blue blue blue,"" indicating it may carry similar output to ""lug"" and adds an extra ""blue.""
- In Example 4, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and proceeds ""dax,"" in both instances it results in three ""blue.""
- In Example 5, ""walm"" immediately follows a ""wif"" and the output is three ""red.""

Based on these analyses, ""walm"" repeated the color of the word before it three times. Each time ""walm"" is mentioned, it takes the color of the previous word and triples it in the output. Therefore, ""walm"" results in a repetition function.

Walm -> meaning: ""walm"" causes the output to triple the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: If 'X' is the color output of the word before ""walm,"" then ""walm"" results in ""X X X"" in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup walm dax lug
    ",Output: blue yellow yellow yellow green blue,blue yellow yellow yellow green blue,True,151
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning: blue. Rule: Whenever the word lug appears, it corresponds to the color blue.
Rule: dax -> green

Each instance of ""dax"" in the input corresponds with ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position or the other words present.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we can analyze the common outcomes associated with its occurrences in the given sentences. Here's the breakdown:

- Every time ""wif"" appears, the word ""red"" is in the output.
- The word appears at the beginning and inside sentences, and in both cases, it corresponds to ""red,"" signifying that its position does not affect its output.
- ""Wif"" is not affected by adjacent words since it consistently maps to ""red,"" regardless of the surrounding words, which correspond to different colors (e.g., ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" etc.).

Rule: wif -> red. 

Based on the provided examples, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"", and the words ""lug"", ""dax"", and ""walm"" seem to correspond to the colors ""blue"", ""green"", and ""green"" respectively. ""Dax"" and ""walm"" both correspond to the color ""green"" yet are different words; this suggests that there may be multiple words for the same color, or context may play a role in the determination of the color.

Here are the corresponding color associations for each word based on the examples:

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- walm -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow

These associations hold true across all examples provided.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> blue

Rule: Each time ""bluf"" appears in the input, it corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be associated with a repetition of the word that follows it in the ""Input"" as a color in the ""Output."" Let's analyze the examples to derive the rule.

Example 1: ""lug walm"" becomes ""blue blue blue"" 
- Here, walm repeats the color blue, which is associated with lug, three times.

Example 2: ""dax walm zup"" becomes ""green green green yellow"" 
- ""walm"" repeats the color green, which is associated with ""dax,"" and ""zup"" is translated to yellow afterward.

Example 3: ""zup dax walm zup wif"" becomes ""yellow green green green yellow red"" 
- ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and repeats its associated color, green, three times. ""Zup"" translates to yellow at the beginning and end, and ""wif"" translates to red.

Example 4: ""zup lug walm"" becomes ""yellow blue blue blue"" 
- ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" and repeats the color blue associated with ""lug"" three times, with ""zup"" at the beginning translating to yellow.

Example 5: ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" becomes ""green green green red blue green green green"" 
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and repeats the color green three times. Then ""wif"" translates to red, ""lug"" to blue, and again ""dax walm"" translates to green repeated three times.

From these examples, the rule seems to be: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word preceding it to be repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> The word preceding ""walm"" is translated into its respective color, and that color is then repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    ",Output: red yellow red green,red yellow red green,True,152
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Rule: lug translates to ""blue.""
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" I'll analyze the inputs against their corresponding outputs to look for a consistent pattern.

1. zup wif dax walm -> yellow red green green green
   - zup corresponds to yellow
   - wif corresponds to red
   - walm corresponds to green 

2. dax bluf lug wif -> green green blue red
   - bluf corresponds to blue
   - lug seems to correspond to red, but could be green

3. wif dax wif -> red green red
   - wif corresponds to red

4. zup bluf wif lug dax -> yellow yellow red blue green
   - zup corresponds to yellow
   - bluf seems to correspond to blue
   - wif corresponds to red
   - lug seems to correspond to blue

5. dax wif walm lug zup -> green red red red blue yellow
   - wif corresponds to red
   - walm corresponds to red
   - lug seems to correspond to blue 
   - zup corresponds to yellow

From the above analysis, several patterns stand out:
   - ""wif"" consistently corresponds to red
   - ""zup"" consistently corresponds to yellow
   - ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to blue, except in example 4 where it seems to be yellow
   - ""lug"" begins to correspond to blue from example 3 onwards
   
The word ""dax"" appears at different positions in the inputs and the color green is assigned to it thrice (once as the first color, once as a middle color, and once as the last color), and it doesn't seem dependent on position. Since ""dax"" isn't consistent with any other given color, it has its own assigned color, which is green.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Each time ""wif"" is mentioned, the output includes the word ""red"" in the corresponding position. Here's how the examples work out:

- ""zup lug wif"" -> ""yellow blue red""
- ""dax walm wif dax"" -> ""green green green red green""
- ""zup wif walm lug"" -> ""yellow red red red blue""
- ""wif dax zup"" -> ""red green yellow""
- ""dax lug wif"" -> ""green blue red""

Thus, the rule we can derive from these examples is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, we can infer a pattern where each word corresponds to a color:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""walm"" also corresponds to ""green""

Given that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" each time it appears, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words around it, we can induce the following rule:

zup -> yellow

Therefore, the meaning of ""zup"" is ""yellow"".
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to result in ""yellow"" when used in combination with other words. It does not seem to depend on its position in the sequence, as ""bluf"" always translates to ""yellow"" regardless of where it appears. Here are the specific observations from the examples:

1. ""zup bluf"" resulted in ""yellow yellow,"" where ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""yellow.""
2. ""lug dax bluf"" resulted in ""blue green green,"" with ""bluf"" corresponding to the second ""green.""
3. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" resulted in ""green red yellow yellow red red red,"" with ""bluf"" corresponding to the fourth ""yellow.""
4. ""dax zup bluf"" resulted in ""green yellow yellow,"" where ""bluf"" corresponds to the third ""yellow.""
5. ""dax bluf zup bluf dax"" resulted in ""green green yellow yellow green,"" with both instances of ""bluf"" corresponding to ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> ""yellow""
The examples provided suggest that `walm` changes the following words to repeat the color associated with the preceding word. Here's how we can interpret the rule based on the examples given:

- Example 1: ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" `lug` corresponds to blue, and since `walm` follows `lug`, it repeats the color blue as many times as there are words following `walm`.

- Example 2: ""lug walm wif lug"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue."" Again, `lug` corresponds to blue, `walm` causes `wif` to change to blue, and since `wif` is normally red, the repetition stops when the next word is `lug`.

- Example 3: ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow."" `wif` corresponds to red, and `walm` causes the following words to change to red, right up until a new word not affected by `walm` appears (dax) which switches the color to green.

- Example 4: ""dax walm wif"" translates to ""green green green red."" `dax` is green, and `walm` changes the following word `wif` to green, and since `wif` normally corresponds to red, the repeating pattern stops.

- Example 5: ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red."" `wif` corresponds to red, and `walm` repeats the color of `wif` for any potential following words.

Based on this analysis, we can deduce the following rule for `walm`:

Rule: walm -> causes the next words to repeat the color of the preceding word until a different, unaffected word appears.

- In the first example, the word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" The other words in the input also correspond to colors in the output (""wif"" to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""walm"" to ""yellow"").

- The second example once again has ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"" despite the order of words changing in the input.

- The third example reiterates the pattern with ""lug"" resulting in ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

- The fourth example maintains the same consistency for ""lug,"" mapping it to ""blue"" even as it is the first word in the sequence.

- The fifth example concludes the pattern; regardless of the placement of ""lug,"" the output is always ""blue.""

From the consistency observed across all examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let us analyze its use in different examples and the corresponding outputs:

1. ""dax lug bluf"" -> ""green blue blue""
2. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""
3. ""zup dax lug"" -> ""yellow green blue""
4. ""zup dax lug walm zup"" -> ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow""
5. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" -> ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow""

In each output string, the word ""green"" appears exactly once, and it aligns with the presence of ""dax"" in the input string. The rest of the words, ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" ""wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""walm,"" correspond to ""blue,"" ""blue,"" ""red,"" ""yellow,"" and ""blue/yellow"" (depending on context), respectively. Based on the patterns, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" as the other words maintain a consistent translation to their respective colors regardless of the presence of ""dax.""

Thus, the rule for ""dax"" is as follows:

Rule: ""dax"" -> ""green""
Given the examples, there seems to be a pattern where each non-wif word is assigned a specific color, while the word ""wif"" is associated with a changing color. The non-wif words and their corresponding outputs are consistent, which allows us to deduce their meanings:

- dax -> green
- walm -> yellow (except when followed by 'lug' after 'wif', which makes it green)
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> red (when followed by 'wif')

Now, let's analyze all instances of ""wif"" to understand its rule:

1. When ""wif"" appears at the beginning of a sequence, it is followed by red:   
- wif dax -> red green
- wif bluf -> red red

2. When ""wif"" appears after a word, it turns red:
- dax wif -> green red
- lug wif -> blue red

3. When ""wif"" appears between two words, the output is red for ""wif"" and the corresponding color for the other words:
- dax wif lug -> green red blue
- bluf wif walm -> red red yellow (however, it's followed by 'lug' so the 'walm' turns green)

4. When ""wif"" is at the end, it is red.

From these observations, the rule seems to be consistent regardless of where ""wif"" is placed in the sequence; it translates to red every time. If 'walm' follows 'wif', it turns green except when 'lug' is directly after 'walm'.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color yellow.
Rule: ""bluf"" seems to indicate repeating the color associated with the previous word. If ""bluf"" is the first word following a different word, then the color associated with the preceding word is repeated twice.

- In the first example, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output is ""green green green"" for ""dax"" and then ""red red"" for ""bluf"" which means bluf takes on the color of ""dax"" (green) twice.

- In the second example, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" and the output is ""red red"" which means ""bluf"" takes on the color of ""wif"" (red) twice.

- In the third example, ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"" and the output is ""yellow yellow"" which means ""bluf"" takes on the color of ""zup"" (yellow) twice.

- In the fourth example, ""lug"" precedes the first ""bluf"" and as such ""bluf"" takes on the color of ""lug"" (blue) twice, and for the second ""bluf"" which follows ""zup"", ""bluf"" takes on the color of ""zup"" (yellow) twice, whereas ""wif"" maintains its own color, red.

- In the fifth example, the pattern continues. ""dax"" is green, and ""bluf"" repeats this color twice for each occurrence following ""dax"". When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", ""bluf"" takes on the color of ""zup"" (yellow) twice.

Bluf -> meaning. Rule: Bluf assumes the color of the word before it, repeated twice. If there is no word before it, bluf might not be used or may not have a defined color in the absence of context.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's start by comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs, focusing on the positioning and repetition of ""walm"" and the associated colors in the output sequences.

- In the first example, ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif"" turns into ""blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" Noticing the pattern, ""walm"" appears twice and the output following each ""walm"" is a repetition of ""blue"" twice and ""yellow"" three times.

- In the second example, ""zup wif dax walm"" turns into ""yellow red green green green."" Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" ""Walm"" occurs once, and after it, we see a repetition of ""green"" three times.

- The third example, ""lug walm dax wif lug wif,"" which outputs ""blue blue blue green red blue red,"" also suggests that ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of colors, again involving ""blue.""

- The fourth example, ""lug walm wif,"" translates to ""blue blue blue red,"" with ""walm"" followed by a repeated ""blue.""

- The fifth example, ""wif lug dax walm,"" which outputs ""red blue green green green,"" shows that after ""dax"" and ""walm,"" there is a repetition of ""green.""

Taking a look at these patterns, it's evident that the occurrence of ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" Moreover, the repeated color appears a number of times that coincide with the total count of ""walm"" appearances in the sequence plus one.

Rule:
walm -> Triggers the repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it, with the number of repetitions being one plus the total count of ""walm"" occurrences in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup dax lug dax
    ",Output: green yellow green blue green,green yellow green blue green,True,154
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"". When ""lug"" is combined with another word, the output demonstrates that each word translates to a specific color. The outputs also suggest that the translation into colors follows the order of input words. Here's a possible mapping based on the examples:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> yellow
- bluf -> red
- dax -> green

Rule: ""lug"" means ""blue"", and the output color sequence corresponds to the sequence of input words, where each word is translated to a specific color.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color green in the outputs. It seems that ""dax"" maintains this meaning regardless of the surrounding context. Other words such as ""zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""lug"" are associated with their respective colors but do not change the meaning of ""dax"" when they accompany it.

Rule: dax -> green. The meaning of ""dax"" is the color green, independent of context.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" I'll look at each example and see where ""wif"" appears and what the corresponding output is. Then I will look for patterns in other words to differentiate the rule for ""wif"" from the rules for other words.

Looking at the examples, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" in the output regardless of its position or the words around it.

Input: wif
Output: red

Input: lug walm wif lug
Output: blue blue blue red blue
- Here, wif is surrounded by ""lug"" and ""walm,"" both of which appear with other outputs, but ""wif"" remains ""red.""

Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
Output: red yellow yellow red green
- Once again, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" with varying words around it.

Input: zup wif dax walm lug
Output: yellow red green green green blue
- ""Wif"" is in the second position and still translates to ""red.""

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue
- ""Wif"" remains ""red,"" and ""lug"" is consistent as ""blue"" from previous examples.
 
Based on these observations, the meaning of ""wif"" is not dependent on context or position—it always translates to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, I will deduce the meaning of the word ""zup.""

1. In the first example, ""zup"" is paired with ""lug walm,"" which results in the sequence green green green yellow blue blue blue. We do not yet have enough information to determine the meaning of ""zup"" alone, but we do see that it is followed by the color yellow.

2. The second example, ""wif zup lug,"" gives us red yellow blue. Once again, ""zup"" is directly followed by the color yellow. ""Wif,"" results in red, and ""lug,"" results in blue, when they appear after ""zup.""

3. The third example consists of just ""zup"" and translates to yellow, which suggests that ""zup"" itself directly corresponds to the color yellow.

4. The fourth example, ""zup dax bluf zup dax,"" translates to yellow green green yellow green. Regardless of its position, ""zup"" directly corresponds to the color yellow, while the surrounding words (""dax"" and ""bluf"") result in colors green and green respectively, regardless of the presence of ""zup.""

5. The fifth example, ""zup bluf wif walm,"" translates to yellow yellow red red red. Here again, ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, while the other words lead to different colors.

Rule:
zup -> yellow

The rule is that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position or context within the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" directly corresponds to the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. To be more specific, ""bluf"" seems to replicate the color output that the prior word generates. Here is how it's interpreted:

- When preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""green green,"" which implies that ""dax"" alone would output ""green,"" and ""bluf"" then generates another ""green.""
- When preceded by ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue,"" which implies that ""lug"" alone would output ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" then generates another ""blue.""
- When preceded by ""wif"" in a sequence where ""lug"" also appears, the output is ""red blue blue red yellow."" This sequence demonstrates that ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with ""lug,"" not ""wif,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" is connected to the nearest color-associated word rather than applying the effect to multiple previous colors.

Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to act as a duplicating word for the color associated with the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color output of the immediately preceding word.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word 'walm' translates to a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. To clarify:

- In the first input, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow."" Since ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" the 'walm' seems to cause the preceding word's color to repeat three times.
- In the second input, ""zup walm lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" Here again, 'walm' causes ""zup"" (which translates to ""yellow"") to repeat three times, and ""lug"" translates separately to ""blue.""
- In the third input, ""zup dax walm zup wif"" translates to ""yellow green green green yellow red."" 'Walm' follows ""dax"" (which translates to ""green"") and causes it to repeat three times. The final ""zup wif"" follows normal translation rules with no repetition involved.
- In the fourth input, ""dax walm zup"" translates to ""green green green yellow."" Like before, 'walm' causes ""dax"" to repeat three times.
- In the fifth input, ""dax lug walm zup wif"" translates to ""green blue blue blue yellow red."" 'Walm' follows ""lug"" and causes the repetition of ""blue"" three times.

Thus, the rule for 'walm' seems to be that it causes the color translation of the word immediately before it to repeat three times.

walm -> meaning: Causes the color translation of the preceding word to repeat three times.

Rule: If 'x' translates to a certain color, ""x walm"" translates to that color being repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,155
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Regardless of its position in the sequence or the number of times it appears, ""lug"" always translates to the color blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" across all examples provided.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in each instance it is used.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each unique word has a corresponding color. The word ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green,"" ""wif"" results in ""red,"" ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" and ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" irrespective of its position in the input.

Therefore, the meaning attributed to the nonce word ""zup"" can be deduced as follows:

zup -> yellow
bluf -> repeats the color word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" appears after another word, the color that the previous word represents should be repeated. For example, if ""bluf"" follows the word ""wif,"" which represents the color red, then ""bluf"" also represents the color red. If ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" representing yellow, ""bluf"" takes on the meaning of yellow. Thus, ""bluf"" acts as a placeholder for the repetition of the preceding color word.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm"" in this context, we can examine how its presence in the input corresponds to the change in the output:

1. zup walm dax -> yellow yellow yellow green
2. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red
3. lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow
4. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
5. lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

The first thing to notice is that whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, the immediately following colors in the output are repetitions of the color that was output right before ""walm"" appeared in the input:

- In example 1, the color before ""walm"" is yellow, and after ""walm,"" we see yellow repeated three times before changing to green.
- In examples 2 and 4, after ""walm,"" we see yellow repeated three times and then a change occurs.
- In example 3, the color green occurs right before ""walm,"" and after ""walm,"" we see green repeated twice before changing to yellow.
- In example 5, the color sequence is blue yellow before ""walm,"" and after ""walm,"" we see yellow repeated twice before changing to blue.

From the examples, it appears that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color immediately preceding it; however, the number of times the color repeats seems dependent on the context or the preceding word(s):

- When the preceding word is ""zup,"" the color repeats three times.
- When the preceding word is ""lug,"" it's followed by blue first and then yellow twice.

However, there's a consistent rule that can be extracted:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the next color in the output to repeat the previous output color an unspecified number of times before eventually changing.

Given the variations in the number of color repetitions after ""walm,"" it's reasonable to conclude that ""walm"" is not tied to a specific number of repetitions, but rather to the concept of repetition of the preceding color itself, potentially influenced by the context or preceding words. Therefore, we can tentatively define the rule as follows:

walm -> meaning: Causes the next output to repeat the color immediately before ""walm"" for an unspecified number of times before changing to another color. The specific number of repetitions might depend on the preceding context.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,156
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.
Analyzing the information provided in the examples, it appears that each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output. Let's examine the patterns:

- Every time the word ""dax"" is present in the input, the word ""green"" follows in the output.
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" as shown in the outputs of the first, third, and fourth inputs.
- The word ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" based on the outputs of the first, second, and third inputs.
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" as shown in the outputs of the third and fourth inputs.
- The word ""lug"" appears once and corresponds to ""blue"" in the fourth input.

With the evidence given in the examples, the rule for ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: dax -> green. The word ""dax"" always corresponds to the color green in the output, regardless of its position or the context within the sequence of words.
Based on the examples provided:

- Every time the word ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red"".
- The other words ""walm"", ""dax"", ""zup"", ""lug"", ""bluf"" correspond to the colors ""red"", ""green"", ""yellow"", ""blue"", and ""green"", respectively, when they appear individually or in combination with ""wif"" or each other.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> meaning. Meaning: yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the provided examples, each instance of ""bluf"" in the input results in ""red red"" in the output before continuing with the translation of the subsequent words:

- wif bluf -> red red
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow
- bluf lug -> red blue (noting that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"")
- wif bluf -> red red
- dax bluf -> green green

However, there is one example that seems to contradict the others:

- bluf wif dax -> green green red green

Here ""bluf"" is succeeded by ""green green,"" which corresponds to ""dax"" based on other examples, instead of ""red red.""

But by looking at all examples, we can see that every time ""bluf"" appears in the input, two of the same color appear in the output before resuming with the normal sequence of colors.

Bluf seems to double the color that corresponds to the word following it:

- In ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so bluf results in ""red red.""
- In ""zup bluf,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so bluf results in ""yellow yellow.""
- In ""lug dax bluf wif,"" ""lug dax"" corresponds to ""blue green,"" and ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" so it results in ""green green red.""

Therefore, we can deduce the rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: bluf causes the next word's corresponding color to be outputted twice.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze each sentence and their corresponding output of colors.

1. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
2. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue
3. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
4. lug dax walm wif -> blue green green green red
5. lug walm -> blue blue blue

It seems that the word ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word that immediately precedes it. To confirm the rule, we can check whether the color that is repeated is indeed the color that corresponds to the word before ""walm.""

- In example 1, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and we see ""green green"" after ""walm.""
- Example 2 shows ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" there is ""blue blue.""
- In example 3, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and following ""walm,"" there is ""red red.""
- Example 4 has ""dax"" before ""walm"" corresponding to ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" we see ""green green.""
- Lastly, example 5 with ""lug"" before ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and there are three ""blue"" after it.

Based on this, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes the color of the word before it to be repeated in the output stream one more time than it would be otherwise.

Rule: walm -> causes repetition of the color associated with the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax wif lug walm zup
    ",Output: red green red blue blue blue yellow,red green red blue blue blue yellow,True,157
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever ""lug"" is present in the input, the word ""blue"" is included in the output. The presence of the word ""dax"" after ""lug"" in the input adds ""green"" to the output after ""blue"". When ""lug"" is the only word in the input, only ""blue"" is in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color green. Each instance of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to ""green"" in the output. The other words in the input seem to correspond to their own color outputs as well (""lug"" to blue, ""walm"" to green, ""wif"" to red, and ""zup"" to yellow).

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> meaning. From the provided examples, each instance of the word ""wif"" consistently correlates with the output ""red"". Therefore, the deduced meaning for ""wif"" is red.

Rule: wif corresponds to the color red.
To deduce a rule for zup, let's look closely at the correlation between the input and output sequences:

Input 1: wif walm dax zup
Output 1: red red red green yellow

Input 2: lug zup
Output 2: blue yellow

Input 3: dax walm wif walm zup
Output 3: green green green red red red yellow

Input 4: zup dax lug wif dax
Output 4: yellow green blue red green

Input 5: dax zup walm wif walm
Output 5: green yellow yellow yellow red red red

The color that comes after each instance of zup does not repeat consistently suggesting that zup itself may not correlate exactly to one particular color. However, let's look at the patterns:

- In every instance, the color yellow appears immediately after zup.
- The appearance of zup does not change the subsequent pattern for other words (e.g., dax consistently translates to green, wif to red).

This suggests that the rule related to zup consistently translates to the color yellow in the resulting color pattern.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> duplicates the color associated with the previous word. Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a word, the output color for ""bluf"" is the same as the color represented by the word that comes directly before it.

Here's the reasoning based on the examples:

- When ""dax"" (which seems to correspond to green) is followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""green green"", suggesting that ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""dax"".
- When ""lug"" (which seems to correspond to blue) is followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""blue blue"", reinforcing the idea that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word.
- The pattern holds regardless of where ""bluf"" appears in the sequence of words: after ""dax"" (green), after ""lug"" (blue), and so forth.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we can observe how it affects the output in each given example. We note the following patterns:

1. In the first example, ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow."" This suggests that ""walm"" may cause the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

2. In the second example, ""lug wif dax walm zup"" translates to ""blue red green green green yellow."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to the color green, and the output is ""green green green"" - which is a repetition of the color green associated with ""dax.""

3. The third example, ""dax walm wif zup,"" results in ""green green green red yellow."" Consistent with the prior observations, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and we get ""green green green,"" a repetition of the color associated with ""dax.""

4. In the fourth example, ""wif walm lug bluf"" corresponds to ""red red red blue blue."" ""Walm"" comes after ""wif,"" which translates to ""red,"" and we see the repetition of this color in the output immediately following it.

5. The fifth example, ""dax walm lug,"" matches ""green green green blue."" Again, ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" followed by a repetition of the color green in the output.

These observations allow us to conclude that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately before it. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: walm -> Causes the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax zup wif
    ",Output: blue green yellow red,blue green yellow red,True,158
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, regardless of its position or surrounding context.
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be associated with colors. Each input contains the word ""dax"" and some other words, and each output contains one or more colors.

Considering each individual example:

- In the first example where ""dax"" is followed by ""zup walm wif,"" the output is ""green"" followed by different colors. It implies that ""dax"" might be associated with the color ""green.""
- In the second example, there are two instances of ""dax"" and both times ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" and both of these are followed by ""walm."" The output is ""green blue green blue blue blue,"" indicating again that ""dax"" might correspond to ""green"" and ""lug"" might correspond to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" might correspond to ""blue"" more than once.
- The third, fourth, and fifth examples consist of only ""dax,"" and all outputs are just ""green,"" reinforcing the idea that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

From these observations, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: dax -> green

""Dax"" consistently correlates with the color ""green"" regardless of the context in which it is used in the examples provided.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the output colors for each input:

1. ""dax walm wif zup"" -> ""green green green red yellow""
2. ""wif"" -> ""red""
3. ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" -> ""yellow yellow red blue green""
4. ""dax wif"" -> ""green red""
5. ""lug dax wif lug"" -> ""blue green red blue""

In each instance where ""wif"" is present, the output color is ""red."" No other colors correspond with the presence of ""wif,"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, based on the examples, ""wif"" consistently maps to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided and the associated outputs, it appears that the word 'bluf' corresponds to the color that immediately precedes it in the sequence. The color words are being translated as follows: ""wif"" -> red, ""dax"" -> green, ""zup"" -> yellow, and ""lug"" -> blue. When 'bluf' is used after one of these color words, the color name is repeated in the output.

Here are the correlations from the examples:

- Example 1: ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" -> red green yellow red green green. The color before 'bluf' is 'dax/green', and 'bluf' results in another 'green'.

- Example 2: ""wif bluf dax"" -> red red green. Here, 'bluf' follows 'wif/red' and the output is another 'red'.

- Example 3: ""lug zup bluf dax"" -> blue yellow yellow green. The word preceding 'bluf' is 'zup/yellow', so 'bluf' produces another 'yellow'.

- Example 4: ""dax bluf wif lug zup"" -> green green red blue yellow. 'Bluf' comes after 'dax/green' and the output is another 'green'.

- Example 5: ""lug bluf"" -> blue blue. 'Bluf' follows 'lug/blue' and results in another 'blue'.

Therefore, the rule for 'bluf' is:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the repetition of the color word immediately preceding 'bluf'.

Rule: When 'bluf' is used in a sequence, the color it outputs is the same as the color word that comes immediately before it.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it multiple times. Each input command appears to correspond with a particular color: ""zup"" equates to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" equates to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" equates to ""red.""

Let's verify this rule with the examples given:

1. Input: ""zup walm""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
   ""Zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" leading to thrice repetition of ""yellow.""

2. Input: ""zup bluf lug zup walm""
   Output: ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
   The ""zup"" before ""walm"" means the output ends in ""yellow"" repeated three times.

3. Input: ""wif lug walm""
   Output: ""red blue blue blue""
   ""Lug"" before ""walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated three times.

4. Input: ""zup bluf wif walm""
   Output: ""yellow yellow red red red""
   The ""wif"" before ""walm"" leads to repeating ""red"" three times.

5. Input: ""lug walm""
   Output: ""blue blue blue""
   Similarly, ""lug"" before ""walm"" makes the output ""blue"" repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule seems to be: walm causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately before it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax
    ",Output: blue green,blue green,True,159
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" within the given context, irrespective of its position or the surrounding words.
Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" can be deduced by looking at the consistent element in the output every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input.

- The first example shows that when ""dax"" precedes ""wif"" and ""zup"", the output starts with ""green"".
- In the second example, ""dax"" appears both at the beginning and in the middle of the input, corresponding to ""green"" at the beginning and in the middle of the output.
- The third example shows ""lug"" followed by ""dax"", with the output being ""blue"" followed by ""green"".
- The fourth example reverses the third, with ""dax"" followed by ""lug"", and the output is ""green"" followed by ""blue"".
- The last example has ""dax"" alone as the input, and the output is simply ""green"".

With each instance of ""dax"" correlating to ""green"" in the output, it can be concluded that in this context:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples given:

- wif bluf lug -> red red blue
- dax bluf wif zup lug -> green green red yellow blue
- wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
- wif zup -> red yellow
- lug wif zup wif -> blue red yellow red

The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the word ""red"" in the outputs, regardless of its position in the input string.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the color associated with the prior word. Using the examples to induce the rule:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the output for both ""dax"" and ""bluf"" is ""green.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and both produce the output ""blue."" Also, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and both produce the output ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output for both is ""red.""
- In the fourth and fifth examples, whenever ""bluf"" follows a word, the color is the same as the one that corresponds to the word preceding ""bluf.""

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" can be framed as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> The color associated with the word that comes before ""bluf.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. Here is the interpretation based on each input and output:

- ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue"": ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, and the output repeats the color blue three times after it.
- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"": ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, and the output repeats the color yellow three times.
- ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red"": ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, and the output repeats the color red three times.
- ""zup walm dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green blue"": ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, repeating yellow three times before moving on to the next color associations for ""dax"" and ""lug.""
- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"": ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, repeating the color blue three times in the output.

From these observations, we can derive the following rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

This indicates that when ""walm"" is used in an input sequence, the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" will be repeated three times in the output sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif
    ",Output: blue red,blue red,True,160
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: In each example, the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following relationships between the input nonce words and the output colors:

- Every individual word in the input is mapped to a specific color in the output.
- The mapping appears consistent across examples: each time a nonce word is mentioned, it is translated to the same color in the output.

From the examples:

1. ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green.""
2. ""bluf"" maps to ""blue.""
3. ""lug"" maps to ""blue.""
4. ""wif"" maps to ""red.""
5. ""zup"" maps to ""yellow.""

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""dax"" -> ""green"".
Rule: wif -> red

Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the corresponding part of the output is ""red"".
Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is used in the input, ""yellow"" is included in the corresponding output.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the provided input and output examples, I will analyze the correlation between the mention of the nonce word ""bluf"" and the colors mentioned in the outputs correspondingly. Here's the breakdown for each example:

1. Input: wif bluf lug 
   Output: red red blue
   - After ""wif"" follows ""red,"" and after ""bluf"" follows another ""red,"" and then ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

2. Input: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup
   Output: blue blue red blue blue yellow
   - ""Lug"" is followed by ""blue,"" ""bluf"" by ""red,"" ""wif"" by ""red,"" ""lug"" by ""blue,"" ""bluf"" by ""red,"" and ""zup"" by ""yellow.""

3. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   - ""Zup"" is followed by ""yellow,"" ""walm"" does not have a clear translation, ""lug"" by ""blue,"" ""wif"" by ""red,"" and ""bluf"" by another ""red.""

4. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   - After ""wif"" follows ""red,"" and ""bluf"" also results in ""red.""

5. Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
   Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
   - ""Zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

The analysis of the inputs and corresponding outputs suggests that ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" when following ""wif"" and to the color ""blue"" otherwise. It is not clear what ""bluf"" represents after ""lug"" and ""zup"" but before ""wif,"" as those combinations do not appear in the examples provided. Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" might be context-dependent based on the preceding word, particularly ""wif."" 

Rule: When immediately following the word ""wif,"" ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red""; otherwise, it translates to ""blue."" This rule is consistent with all examples given except the combination ""lug bluf,"" which does not clearly fit the pattern based on the examples provided; therefore, I would need more examples to refine the rule for that specific context.

bluf -> meaning:
- After ""wif"": red
- Otherwise: blue
Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word three times. 
- In all examples, when the word ""walm"" is presented, the output color is repeated three times based on the color of the previous word. For ""wif,"" which outputs ""red,"" ""walm"" leads to ""red red red."" For ""lug,"" which outputs ""blue,"" ""walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue."" There is no example with ""zup"" followed by ""walm,"" but following the established pattern, if ""zup,"" which outputs ""yellow,"" were to be followed by ""walm,"" it would lead to ""yellow yellow yellow.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax walm wif
    ",Output: yellow green green green red,yellow green green green red,True,161
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the outputs. Each instance of ""lug"" in the inputs is replaced with ""blue"" in the outputs.
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, the output includes ""red."" The other words correspond to different colors as well: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" and ""zup"" both correspond to repeating ""yellow."" Here is the deduced rule:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Other words correspond to different colors: ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" The word ""walm"" seems to be repeated in a pattern, perhaps indicating that it means ""green"" too, or that it repeats the color of the word immediately before it.

Thus, the rule can be formulated as:

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to lead to an output color that is the same as the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it. However, when ""bluf"" appears at the end of a sequence, it results in yellow. Let's examine the examples to confirm this rule:

1. ""dax bluf"" leads to ""green green"" – ""bluf"" takes the color of ""dax,"" which is green.
2. ""lug bluf"" leads to ""blue blue"" – ""bluf"" takes the color of ""lug,"" which is blue.
3. ""dax lug bluf"" leads to ""green blue blue"" – ""bluf"" takes the color of ""lug,"" which is blue.
4. ""dax zup bluf"" leads to ""green yellow yellow"" – ""bluf"" seems to take the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.
5. The output sequence that ends with ""bluf"" after ""wif"" or ""zup"" results in yellow (""wif bluf -> red yellow"" and ""zup bluf -> yellow yellow""). Since ""wif"" is red and ""zup"" is yellow, this doesn't follow the previous observation unless ""bluf"" at the end of a sequence defaults to yellow instead of following the color before it.

Given the inconsistency with the last observation, let's propose the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" causes the output to match the color of the word directly before it, except if ""bluf"" is the last word in a sequence, in which case the outcome is yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the input and the corresponding output.

1. ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow"" — this suggests ""walm"" could cause a repetition of the color word before it, which in this case is ""yellow.""
2. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" outputs ""green blue blue blue yellow red"" — in this instance, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the color ""blue"" is repeated three times. Again, ""walm"" seems to cause a repetition.
3. ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" outputs ""green green green red blue green green green"" — after ""dax,"" ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated thrice. When ""walm"" appears again after ""dax,"" the output is another three ""green.""
4. ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif"" outputs ""blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red"" — ""walm"" succeeds ""lug,"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times; following ""zup,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
5. ""dax walm zup walm"" outputs ""green green green yellow yellow yellow"" — similar to previous patterns, ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in ""green"" being repeated three times, and after ""zup,"" ""yellow"" is repeated thrice.

Rule: ""walm"" -> When following a color word or the word that generates a color, ""walm"" causes the generated color word to be repeated three times.

Using this rule, we can interpret the coined word ""walm"" as follows: 

walm -> Repeat the preceding color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the outputs. The presence of ""lug"" doesn't appear to affect the number of times ""blue"" is output beyond its own occurrence (each instance of ""lug"" translates directly to one ""blue"" in the output, regardless of what other words are present).

Here is the rule according to the examples:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". Every time ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green"".
Based on the provided examples, we can make the following observations:

- Whenever the word ""wif"" appears, the output includes the color ""red.""
- The presence of ""wif"" does not seem to be affected by its position in the sequence.
- Other words have a one-to-one correspondence with other colors (e.g., ""lug"" always corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"").

Given these observations, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" appears to be:

Rule: wif -> ""red""
Based on the examples provided, where the presence of the nonce word ""zup"" always corresponds to the output ""yellow,"" it can be deduced that ""zup"" means ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, ""bluf"" appears to directly repeat the color associated with the word that comes directly before it. Here are the observations:

- ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"", indicating that ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""zup"".
- ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"", showing that ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""dax"".
- ""zup bluf dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow green blue"", again showing that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word ""zup"" and has no effect on the following words ""dax"" and ""lug"".
- ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"", so ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""lug"".
- ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" translates to ""red red blue green red"", supporting the pattern that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word, which is ""wif"" in this case.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the given examples, we need to analyze the correspondence between the inputs and outputs. We should look for a pattern in the words preceding ""walm"" and their associated colors in the output.

Let's examine the inputs and outputs:

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - ""walm"" seems to cause the outputting of a repetition of ""red"" (the color associated with ""wif"").

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""walm"" here repeats ""green"" (associated with ""dax"").

3. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""walm"" causes a repetition of ""yellow"" (associated with ""zup"").

4. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red
   - ""walm"" repeats ""green"" (associated with ""dax""). The ""wif"" following ""walm"" results in a single ""red"".

5. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and we get a repetition of ""blue"". Then the pattern returns to responding to single words with their associated colors.

From these inputs and outputs, we can deduce that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word preceding it multiple times. The number of repetitions does not seem consistent across examples, but it may be related to other factors not immediately clear from the examples provided.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

The specific rule for the number of repetitions is uncertain based on these examples alone since the number of repetitions varies and doesn't have an immediately obvious pattern.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,163
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can observe the following patterns:

- When ""lug"" follows ""wif"", the output is ""red blue"".
- When ""lug"" follows ""dax"", the output starts with ""green blue"".
- When ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"", the output ends with ""blue blue blue"".
- When ""lug"" is followed by ""zup"", the output ends with ""yellow"".

From these patterns, we can deduce that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and that the word that precedes or follows it can affect the color that comes before or after ""blue"" in the output. Specifically:

- ""wif"" translates to ""red"".
- ""dax"" translates to ""green"".
- ""walm"" requires the repetition of ""blue"" three times.
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".

Therefore, the rule for ""lug"" seems to be:

Rule: lug -> blue

The presence of other words in the input affects the output colors that come before or after ""blue"" based on their own corresponding translations or rules.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the outputs.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Here's the rule I deduced from the examples:

wif -> red

Other words seem to correspond to other colors as well:
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> red

Rule: Each nonce word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. ""Wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, we can induce that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the output reflects the color ""yellow"" in its corresponding position.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
By examining the examples provided, I can deduce the following color mappings:

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green

Assessing the term ""bluf"" in relation to others:

1. In the first example, after ""wif"" (which is red) comes ""bluf"" and it produces ""red red"". Thus, ""bluf"" may replicate the color of the word before it.
2. In the second example, we see ""lug bluf"" at the end, which results in ""blue blue"". This is consistent with the initial observation, where ""bluf"" again takes the color of the previous word.
3. In the third example, despite ""bluf"" being followed by ""lug zup,"" it reproduces ""red,"" the color of ""wif,"" the word that precedes it.
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and results in two ""greens,"" adhering to the rule.
5. Finally, ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" gives a sequence where ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" to produce ""green green,"" and later, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" to result in ""yellow yellow,"" thus ""bluf"" continues to obey the rule of taking the color of the word that precedes it.

In conclusion, the deduced rule for ""bluf"" is that it takes on the color of the word that directly precedes it in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.
Rule: The word ""walm"" means repeating the color associated with the previous word multiple times. The number of times the color is repeated matches the number of letters in the word ""walm"" (which is four).

""walm"" -> meaning. Meaning is repeating the last color mentioned four times.

For example:
- zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow blue (Since ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"", ""walm"" causes it to repeat four times, but changes the last instance to ""blue"")
- dax walm -> green green green (Since ""dax"" is associated with ""green"", ""walm"" causes it to repeat three times; the fourth instance isn't mentioned)
- dax wif walm -> green red red red (Since ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with ""red"", ""walm"" causes it to repeat four times)
- zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red (Since ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"", it is repeated three times due to ""walm"" and then ""wif"" changes the sequence with ""red"")
- zup wif dax walm -> yellow red green green green (The sequence before ""walm"" is ""yellow red green"", and ""walm"" causes the last color, ""green"", to repeat three times)

However, there seems to be an inconsistency with the number of repetitions; for example, ""dax walm"" yields three greens instead of four, and the pattern of the last color turning blue in some cases but not in others is not consistent with other inputs. Given these irregularities, my rule induction might not capture the entire complexity of the system generating the outputs.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. From the given examples, lug consistently corresponds with the color blue.

Rule: ""lug"" means ""blue"".
Based on the given examples, it seems that each word translates to a specific color. Here's the breakdown of the examples given:

- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""zup"" seems to consistently translate to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" seems to consistently translate to ""red.""
- ""bluf"" appears once and translates to ""blue.""
- ""lug"" also appears once and translates to ""red.""
- ""walm"" translates to ""green"" in its single appearance, however, it is preceded by ""dax,"" which also translates to ""green,"" so it's uncertain whether ""walm"" also means ""green"" alone.

From this breakdown, the rule for ""dax"" can be determined:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Other words in the examples translate to other colors, such as ""bluf"" translating to the color ""red"" and ""dax"" and ""walm"" to the color ""green."" The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule is: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following associations between input words and output colors:

- Whenever the word ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow.""
- The word ""lug"" seems to correspond to the color ""blue.""
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- The apparent meaning of ""bluf"" and ""walm"" is less clear from the provided examples, but ""bluf"" seems to be associated with ""yellow"" as well, and ""walm"" with ""red,"" though these last two associations are less direct.

Given these observations, here is the rule for ""zup"":

Rule: zup -> yellow

Considering ""zup"" always results in the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it, we can reasonably infer that ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we must identify patterns and correlations in the given input and the corresponding output. Let's analyze the examples provided:

1. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow
   - ""wif"" correlates with the first ""red""
   - ""bluf"" correlates with the second ""red""
   - ""lug"" correlates with ""blue""
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""

2. Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue yellow red red green
   - The ""dax"" at the beginning and end correlates with ""green""
   - ""lug"" correlates with ""blue""
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" correlates with ""red""
   - ""bluf"" correlates with the second ""red""

3. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   - ""wif"" correlates with the first ""red""
   - ""bluf"" correlates with the second ""red""

4. Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
   Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow
   - ""dax"" correlates with ""green""
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" correlates with ""blue""
   - The second ""zup"" correlates with the second ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" correlates with the second ""yellow"" in this case

5. Input: zup bluf dax
   Output: yellow yellow green
   - ""zup"" correlates with the first ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" correlates with the second ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" correlates with ""green""

From the examples above, we can observe that ""bluf"" is consistently followed by a color. The color that follows ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color that immediately precedes it. In examples 1, 2, and 3, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which correlates with ""red,"" and the output is ""red."" In example 4, though ""bluf"" precedes ""zup,"" it results in ""yellow,"" which is the color that correlates with ""zup."" In example 5, ""bluf"" is again followed by a ""yellow,"" replicating the preceding color correlated with ""zup.""

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color that precedes it in the sequence.

bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word.
Rule: walm -> repetition of the color associated with the previous word thrice.

Looking at the examples:

- ""wif walm"" output is ""red red red"" where ""wif"" represents ""red"" and is then repeated thrice.
- ""lug lug walm"" output is ""blue blue blue"" where ""lug"" represents ""blue"" and is then repeated thrice.

Walm seems to take the color associated with the word immediately preceding it and repeats that color three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Given the examples, we can start by comparing inputs that contain ""zup"" and their corresponding outputs. We notice that every time ""zup"" appears, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

Let's map each word in the inputs without ""zup"" to their colors in the outputs:

- walm -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- bluf -> red

Now, let's check if ""zup"" corresponds to one of these existing mappings or to something new:

1. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

2. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow

3. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue

4. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow

5. Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue yellow red red green

From observation, ""zup"" always corresponds to the output ""yellow,"" regardless of the surrounding words. Therefore, the word ""zup"" itself translates to ""yellow."" No other dependencies are apparent in the examples provided.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Bluf -> repeat the color of the word before bluf.

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, it repeats the color indicated by the word that directly precedes it. For example, ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" so ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red."" When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" which correlates with ""blue,"" the output is ""blue blue,"" and ""zup"" which correlates with ""yellow"" results in ""yellow yellow"" when followed by ""bluf.""
To figure out what ""walm"" means, let's examine the pattern within each of the provided examples.

- In the first example (""dax walm wif""), it appears that ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" while ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" Given that ""walm"" is surrounded by two words that translate to ""green"" and ""red,"" it produces ""green green green red.""
- In the second example (""lug walm wif lug bluf""), ""lug"" means ""blue,"" as evidenced by the ""blue blue"" at the end, and ""bluf"" is the last word that is also translated as ""blue."" ""wif"" still means ""red."" The presence of ""walm"" after ""lug"" causes a repetition of ""blue blue blue"" before the ""red"" that follows ""wif.""
- In the third example (""dax wif zup bluf wif walm""), ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" (same as the previous example for ""zup""). ""walm"" appears at the end after ""wif,"" causing a tripling of ""red.""
- In the fourth example (""dax lug walm""), ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" ""Walm"" occurs after ""lug,"" and this time we see ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" causes a color to be repeated three times.
- In the fifth example (""dax walm wif walm zup""), following our established definitions, ""walm"" again seems to cause the preceding color word (""green"") to triple, followed by ""red"" for ""wif."" Then, after the second ""wif,"" there's another ""walm"" before ""zup,"" and this causes ""red"" to be repeated three times before ""yellow"" for ""zup.""

From these examples, the rule appears to be:

Rule: walm -> When following a color word, ""walm"" causes that color word to repeat three times. If ""walm"" follows a non-color word (e.g., ""wif""), then it seems to cause the last mentioned color to be repeated three times.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning. Meaning is that ""walm"" causes the previously mentioned color to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,166
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the meaning of ""lug"" can be deduced as follows:

- When ""lug"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""blue"" after ""green.""
- When ""lug"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""blue"" after ""red.""
- When ""lug"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue"" before ""blue.""
- When ""lug"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""blue"" after ""yellow.""

In every instance regardless of the word that precedes ""lug,"" the output after ""lug"" is ""blue."" There is no variation with different preceding words, which suggests that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue."" Therefore, the rule for ""lug"" is:

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the examples provided, each input word corresponds to a unique color in the output. The word ""dax"" appears in different positions in the input and is always translated to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position. Therefore, it can be deduced that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" In each instance, the occurrence of ""wif"" in the input results in ""red"" appearing in the output at the corresponding position.

Here is the pattern according to each example: 

- Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue (wif corresponds to red)
- Input: zup bluf wif walm -> Output: yellow yellow red red red (wif corresponds to the first red)
- Input: wif -> Output: red (wif corresponds to red)
- Input: wif lug wif -> Output: red blue red (both occurrences of wif correspond to red)
- Input: dax walm wif walm -> Output: green green green red red red (wif corresponds to the first red)

The rule can be summarized as:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided where each input term corresponds to a color in the output, it looks like ""zup"" consistently translates to the color yellow. Here is the evidence from the inputs and outputs:

- Input ""wif zup"" results in ""red yellow"", so ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when following ""wif"".
- Input ""zup lug"" results in ""yellow blue"", so ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when preceding ""lug"".
- Input ""zup"" on its own results in just ""yellow"", further supporting that ""zup"" is the term for yellow.
- Input ""zup lug zup wif dax"" results in ""yellow blue yellow red green"", so ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" both times it appears.
- Input ""dax wif zup"" results in ""green red yellow"", so ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when following ""wif dax"".

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look at each example and identify any correlations between the input and the output.

In the examples provided, ""bluf"" consistently correlates with the output ""red."" Here is the breakdown:

- dax bluf wif lug -> green green red blue
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow
- lug dax bluf wif dax -> blue green green red green
- zup dax zup dax wif bluf -> yellow green yellow green red red

In every case, regardless of the position of ""bluf"" within the input sequence or the words it is associated with, the output remains ""red."" There are no counterexamples to this in the given data. We can therefore conclude from the given examples that ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the pattern in relation to the other words and their corresponding outputs:

1. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
2. ""dax walm wif bluf"" -> ""green green green red red""
3. ""zup lug walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue""
4. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red""
5. ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" -> ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow""

Now let's examine the patterns:

- In example 1, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and when ""walm"" is used after ""wif,"" we see the output is ""red red red,"" which suggests ""walm"" may repeat the color associated with the word preceding it, in this case, three times.
- In example 2, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and when ""walm"" follows, we get ""green green green,"" another threefold repetition.
- In example 3, ""lug"" produces ""blue,"" and following ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- Similarly, in example 4, ""zup"" equates to ""yellow,"" and when followed by ""walm,"" we get ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- Lastly, in example 5, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and after the sequence ""wif zup lug dax zup,"" the output is ""red yellow blue green yellow,"" but when ""walm"" comes after another ""zup,"" it repeats ""yellow"" three more times.

From these examples, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" causes the color output associated with the immediately preceding word to repeat three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,167
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".
To determine the meaning or the rule associated with the nonce word ""dax,"" let's examine the patterns of color outputs related to the appearance of ""dax"" in the inputs.

From the examples given:

1. ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" produces ""red yellow yellow red green""
   - ""dax"" follows ""wif,"" resulting in ""green.""
   
2. ""wif dax zup dax"" produces ""red green yellow green""
   - ""dax"" follows ""wif"" for the first ""green"" and is followed by ""zup"" for the second ""green.""
   
3. ""zup lug wif dax lug"" produces ""yellow blue red green blue""
   - ""dax"" follows ""wif,"" resulting in ""green.""
   
4. ""dax walm"" produces ""green green green""
   - ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" and both ""dax"" and ""walm"" result in ""green.""
   
5. ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" produces ""yellow yellow red green red yellow""
   - ""dax"" follows ""wif"" once again, leading to ""green.""

Observations:

- The word ""dax"" is consistently followed by the color ""green"" in the output.
- ""dax"" does not seem to depend on the word that precedes it for its color output.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be quite straightforward:

Rule: ""dax"" -> ""green"" regardless of the context within the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red.""

Here's the breakdown:

- Example 1: ""wif"" is between ""lug"" and ""dax,"" which output ""red"" and ""green"" respectively.
- Example 2: ""wif"" is the only input and the output is ""red.""
- Example 3: ""wif"" appears three times, and each time the output is ""red.""
- Example 4: ""wif"" is in the sequence with ""dax"" and ""walm"" which are ""green,"" but ""wif"" is still ""red"".
- Example 5: ""wif"" appears once in a sequence of other words, translating to ""red"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

zup -> yellow
Based on the input-output pairs provided, it is possible to deduce the following pattern:

- ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue""
- ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green""
- ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red""
- ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow""

The pattern suggests that ""bluf"" repeats the color represented by the word that precedes it. Thus, the rule seems to be that the word ""bluf"" means repeat the previous color.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the previous color.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" affects the output by repeating the color associated with the previous word. Here are the rules we can deduce from the input-output pairs:

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow

Now let's apply these rules to the examples with the nonce word ""walm"":

1. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   - Corresponds to: red ??? green ??? red red red (walm repeats the color for the last non-nonce word) blue red

2. Input: dax walm wif dax
   - Corresponds to: green green (walm repeats the color for dax) green red green

3. Input: wif dax lug walm
   - Corresponds to: red green blue blue blue (walm repeats the color for lug)

4. Input: zup walm
   - Corresponds to: yellow yellow yellow (walm repeats the color for zup)

5. Input: lug wif walm
   - Corresponds to: blue red red red (walm repeats the color for wif)

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color that corresponds to the previous word in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word in the output sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,168
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output contains the color ""blue."" There is a one-to-one mapping between the occurrence of ""lug"" and ""blue"" in the outputs, regardless of the positions of other words that translate into different colors.

Here is the rule based on the examples:

lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" is present in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green."" Each instance of the word ""dax"" in the input corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each non-wif word corresponds to a unique color. Here is the mapping from the examples:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> red
- walm -> red (this is inferred, as ""wif walm lug"" results in ""red red blue"")

The outputs are consistent regardless of the position of the words in the input sequence.

Now, let's focus on ""wif."" ""Wif"" always corresponds to ""red"" in the output. However, unlike ""bluf,"" which also translates to ""red,"" ""wif"" cannot be a simple direct translation to the color red because of the example ""zup wif walm lug,"" which implies that ""walm"" also is red but follows ""wif."" 

However, every instance of ""wif"" is directly followed by the color red in the output. Looking at the examples, ""wif"" itself does not appear in the first example but the sequence ""wif dax"" corresponds to ""red green,"" adhering to the earlier rule we established and thus behaving the same way ""bluf"" would in that position.

So, the translation of ""wif"" seems to be context-independent, and ""wif"" directly translates to the color ""red."" 

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we have to analyze the corresponding outputs for each given input where ""zup"" appears.

Let’s examine the examples where ""zup"" is used:

1. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
2. wif dax zup dax -> red green yellow green
3. dax zup -> green yellow
4. lug zup dax lug -> blue yellow green blue
5. lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Cross-referencing each example:

- When ""dax"" is present, the output is ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" is mentioned, the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""lug"" is used, the output is ""blue.""
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- The presence of ""walm"" results in ""yellow.""

Examining where ""zup"" is used, we can deduce the following:

In example 1, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the output corresponding to ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" which is the same as the output for ""bluf.""

In example 2, ""zup"" is between two ""dax"" words, and the output corresponding to ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" which is different from the output for ""dax"" being ""green.""

In example 3, ""zup"" follows ""dax,"" and again, the output corresponding to ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

In example 4, ""zup"" is between ""lug"" and ""dax,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" which is different from the outputs for ""lug"" (blue) and ""dax"" (green).

Lastly, in example 5, ""zup"" follows the sequence ""lug bluf dax lug,"" and it precedes ""walm"" and another ""lug."" Both occurrences of ""zup"" result in the output ""yellow,"" just as both occurrences of ""walm"" do.

Based on these observations, we can infer a rule that ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow,"" regardless of the surrounding context.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be that it translates to the color that is immediately before it, if it has been mentioned, or yellow if no color has been mentioned before it. Let's analyze the examples to solidify this observation:

Input: zup lug zup lug zup **bluf**
Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow **yellow**

In this sequence, ""bluf"" appears after ""zup"" which is translated as ""yellow,"" and hence ""bluf"" is translated to ""yellow"" as well.

Input: dax lug **bluf** wif
Output: green blue **blue** red

Here, ""bluf"" appears after ""lug"" which is translated as ""blue,"" and hence ""bluf"" is also ""blue.""

Input: wif **bluf**
Output: red **red**

In this sequence, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which is translated as ""red,"" making ""bluf"" become ""red"" as well.

Input: dax wif zup **bluf** wif walm
Output: green red yellow **yellow** red red red

Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow;"" therefore, ""bluf"" becomes ""yellow.""

Input: lug walm wif lug **bluf**
Output: blue blue blue red blue **blue**

Finally, in this sequence, ""bluf"" appears after ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" also translates to ""blue.""

Now let's formalize the deduced rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the color mentioned right before it. If no color is mentioned before ""bluf"" in a sequence or it is at the beginning of the sequence, translate ""bluf"" to ""yellow.""

So, the rule for ""bluf"" based on the provided examples is:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the previously mentioned color, or ""yellow"" if no color has been mentioned before it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the given examples, let's analyze the patterns:

1. In the first two examples, ""lug walm"" consistently outputs ""blue blue blue."" This might indicate that ""walm"" involves repetition of the color associated with ""lug,"" which we infer to be blue. 
2. In the third example, ""dax walm lug"" outputs ""green green green blue,"" suggesting ""walm"" repeats the color for ""dax,"" which is green, before moving on to the next term ""lug"" which as mentioned before seems to be blue.
3. Combining the analysis from the first two points, whatever word comes before ""walm"" takes its color and ""walm"" produces two additional instances of that color.
4. The fourth example, ""dax zup walm wif walm,"" confirms this repeating behavior since the output after ""dax"" is one green followed by ""zup"" which is yellow, and then ""walm wif walm"" leads to ""yellow red red red,"" showing again the triplet pattern.
5. In the fifth example ""zup wif dax walm,"" after ""zup wif"" which translates to ""yellow red,"" we see ""dax walm"" outputting ""green green green"" again demonstrating that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, in this case, ""dax"" which is green.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm
    ",Output: blue blue blue,blue blue blue,True,169
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the outputs regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, we can infer that ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green."" Every instance where ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding output. Furthermore, the relationship between ""dax"" and ""green"" seems consistent regardless of the other words that appear with it.

- In the first example, ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue."" 
- In the second example, ""lug"" remains ""blue,"" and ""wif"" is added as ""red.""
- In the third example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" and ""wif"" maintain their meanings as ""blue"" and ""red,"" respectively.
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" still corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" also corresponds to ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" is associated with a repetition of ""blue"" three times.

The pattern shows that ""dax"" has a one-to-one correspondence with ""green,"" irrespective of the other words it is paired with.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the output. No matter the position of ""wif"" in the input sequence, or what other words are present, it always corresponds to ""red"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule appears to be quite simple:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in every instance.
Based on the examples provided, each instance of the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
From the given examples, it appears that each word is assigned a specific color. When we examine the word ""bluf"" across multiple examples:

- dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow
- wif lug zup bluf -> red blue yellow yellow
- zup bluf lug zup -> yellow yellow blue yellow
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow
- zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue

We can see that the word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

bluf -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, 'walm' seems to be a rule that dictates repeating the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it three times. Here's how we can deduce this:

- In the first example, 'lug walm dax' outputs 'blue blue blue green.' Here, 'lug' generates 'blue,' and 'walm' causes 'blue' to be repeated three times before 'dax' changes it to 'green.'

- In the second example, 'lug walm wif' outputs 'blue blue blue red.' Again, 'lug' corresponds to 'blue,' 'walm' makes 'blue' repeat three times, and then 'wif' changes it to 'red.'

- In the third example, 'wif walm' outputs 'red red red,' where 'wif' associates with 'red,' and 'walm' causes 'red' to be repeated three times.

- In the fourth example, 'zup walm' outputs 'yellow yellow yellow.' 'Zup' corresponds to 'yellow,' and 'walm' makes it repeat three times.

- The final example is 'zup lug walm wif dax' with the output 'yellow blue blue blue red green.' The sequence follows the pattern of each color word being associated with a color: 'zup' with 'yellow,' 'lug' with 'blue,' 'walm' causing the most recent color ('blue') to be repeated three times, 'wif' changing to 'red,' and 'dax' then changing to 'green.'

So, the rule we can induce is:
walm -> Repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.

Rule:
If the preceding word represents a color, then 'walm' makes that color appear three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax zup wif walm
    ",Output: yellow green yellow red red red,yellow green yellow red red red,True,170
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be:

lug -> meaning: ""blue""

This suggests that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue,"" regardless of the context in which it is used. When paired with other words, such as ""dax"" and ""zup,"" it may be part of a combination that results in additional colors being named; however, the consistent element is that ""lug"" itself means ""blue.""

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rules for the colors associated with certain words:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> (likely to be green, but it is inconsistent with the third example)

Since we do not have enough context to determine why ""bluf"" outputs different colors in different examples (yellow in the third example and green in the last), it might be a special case, or there may be a typo or mistake in the third example. However, given the provided data, we can be confident about the colors for the other words.

Rule:
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> undetermined (possibly intended as green, but there is a conflict in the examples)
Examining the examples, we can determine the following correlations:

- Whenever the word ""wif"" appears, the color ""red"" is part of the output.
- The position of ""wif"" in the input seems to direct where ""red"" appears in the output; its position corresponds directly to the position of ""red"" in the output sequence.
- No other word in the input seems to correlate directly with the output ""red"" other than ""wif.""

If we review the given examples following these observations:

- ""zup"" is correlated with ""yellow."" 
- ""dax"" and ""bluf"" are both correlated with ""green,"" but ""bluf"" also results in ""blue"" in certain contexts, suggesting that it might be context-sensitive.
- ""lug"" is consistently correlated with ""blue.""
- ""walm"" correlates with ""red"" but only appears once; since ""wif"" is not present and its meaning according to the rule is 'red', ""walm"" could mean multiple 'red's or an intensifier for 'red', but we would need more examples to confirm that.

Based on the data we have, the meaning for ""wif"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: wif -> red

Wif directly translates to the color red in the output, and its positional presence in the input sequence dictates the positional presence of red in the output sequence.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" represents the color yellow. Each time ""zup"" is present in the input, ""yellow"" is present in the output. Additionally, other words seem to correspond to other colors (""wif"" to red and ""dax"" to green). When a color-word is repeated in the input (as with ""walm"" in the third example), the corresponding color in the output is repeated the same number of times.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, the most plausible rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be that it results in the output being a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. 

To illustrate with the given examples:
1. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
2. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
3. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
4. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Wherever we see ""bluf"", the color that precedes it is repeated. For example, ""wif bluf"" gives us ""red red"", indicating ""bluf"" causes the preceding colour (""wif"" which is ""red"") to be repeated.

Therefore, the rule is as follows:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to change the color mentioned before it to the color itself. Each instance of ""walm"" seems to repeat the output of the color word it follows. Let's analyze the given strings:

1. Input: ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm""
   Output: ""green red yellow yellow red red red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" has to correspond to ""yellow"" to match the second instance of ""yellow"". The ""walm"" that follows ""wif"" results in ""red red"" which suggests repetition of the color output of ""wif"".

2. Input: ""dax walm zup walm""
   Output: ""green green green yellow yellow yellow""
   - The ""walm"" after ""dax"" produces ""green green"" which indicates it repeats the color ""green"" associated with ""dax"". Similarly, after ""zup"", ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow"", repeating the color ""yellow"" associated with ""zup"".

3. Input: ""dax lug dax lug walm""
   Output: ""green blue green blue blue blue""
   - The ""walm"" after the second ""lug"" produces ""blue blue"", mimicking the color output of ""lug"".

4. Input: ""zup dax walm""
   Output: ""yellow green green green""
   - After ""dax"", ""walm"" results in ""green green"", once again repeating the color ""green"".

5. Input: ""dax walm wif""
   Output: ""green green green red""
   - The ""walm"" following ""dax"" gives ""green green"" before the sequence switches to ""wif"" with ""red"".

From these observations, it appears that the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes repetition of the most recent color word's associated output color. Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color output of the word preceding it.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color output of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Lug -> blue. 

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in each example.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each instance of a different word maps to a specific color as follows:

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green

So according to these examples, whenever we see the word ""dax"" in the input, it is translated to ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. The word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" in every example it appears.

Therefore, the rule is:
wif -> red
Based on the given examples, we can observe the following patterns:

- Whenever the nonce word ""zup"" appears on its own, the output is ""yellow"".
- When ""zup"" follows other words, it seems to correlate with ""yellow"" followed by a repetition of the last color word mentioned before it.
- If ""zup"" is the last word, there's no repetition of the last color (as seen in the last example).

With these patterns in mind, let us create a rule for ""zup"":

Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" followed by a repetition of the previously mentioned color in the sequence, except when it is the final word, in which case there is no repetition and ""zup"" only means ""yellow"".

Thus, zup -> ""yellow"" followed by a repetition of the previous color word, unless it is the last word, in which case it is only ""yellow"".
bluf -> repeated color of the previous word.

Rule: When the word bluf follows another color-indicating word, the output color is the same as the color indicated by the word preceding bluf. If bluf is preceded by ""lug,"" the output is blue; if by ""wif,"" it's red, and if by ""zup,"" it's yellow. If bluf follows a word that doesn't have a direct color meaning, such as ""walm,"" the rule is not directly stated but can still be deduced by looking at the sequence; in the provided examples, ""walm"" is not directly translated to a color, but following a sequence of ""bluf lug"" which corresponds to ""blue blue,"" it's indicated that ""walm"" might mean blue as well in the given context, thus ""bluf"" following ""walm"" would also output blue. However, with the given examples, there is not enough evidence to conclude the meaning of ""walm"" and therefore the translation of ""bluf"" in that specific context is based on the immediate pattern rather than a defined rule for ""walm.""
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to cause the preceding word to repeat its associated color three times. We can deduce this by observing the output patterns from the given inputs:

1. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". In the first example, after ""zup"" comes ""walm"", and the output for ""zup walm"" is ""yellow yellow yellow"".
2. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". In the second and third examples, after ""wif"" comes ""walm"", and the output each time is ""red red red"".
3. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". In the fourth example, after ""dax"" comes ""walm"", and the output is ""green green green"".
4. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". In the fifth example, after ""lug"" comes ""walm"", and the output is ""blue blue blue"".

Based on the evidence, we can state the following rule:

Rule: walm causes the preceding color word's associated color to be repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
From the given examples, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" Here is the evidence from the examples:

1. zup dax lug zup -> yellow green blue yellow (lug corresponds to blue)
2. lug bluf zup -> blue blue yellow (lug corresponds to blue at the beginning)
3. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue (lug corresponds to blue)
4. lug dax lug -> blue green blue (both instances of lug correspond to blue)
5. wif zup bluf lug -> red yellow yellow blue (lug corresponds to blue at the end)

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time ""dax"" is used in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the same position in the output.

Here is the rule induction based on the examples:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, I will analyze the occurrences of the nonce word ""wif"" and its corresponding output to deduce its meaning:

- In the first example, ""zup lug zup wif dax"" corresponds to ""yellow blue yellow red green."" The word ""wif"" is located between ""yellow"" and ""green,"" which are the outputs for ""zup"" and ""dax,"" respectively. In this context, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
  
- The second example is simply ""wif,"" and the output is ""red,"" which directly supports the initial observation from the first example.

- In the third example, ""wif dax zup walm"" is translated to ""red green yellow yellow yellow."" The word ""wif"" is at the beginning and correspondsto ""red."" This further reinforces the observation that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

- The fourth example, ""zup walm lug zup wif dax,"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green."" Once again, ""wif"" is just before ""dax"" and corresponds to ""red.""

- In the final example, ""zup dax wif"" corresponds to ""yellow green red,"" with ""wif"" being at the end and translating as ""red.""

Based on all the given examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Each input containing the word ""zup"" consistently results in the output including the color ""yellow"".

- In the first input, ""wif zup"" outputs ""red yellow"", with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"".
- In the second input, ""zup lug bluf"" outputs ""yellow blue blue"", with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"" and the other words corresponding to other colors.
- In the third input, ""lug zup"" outputs ""blue yellow"", with ""zup"" again corresponding to ""yellow"".
- In the fourth input, ""zup"" as a single input results in ""yellow"", confirming that ""zup"" on its own represents the color ""yellow"".
- Finally, in the fifth input, ""dax lug zup"" outputs ""green blue yellow"", with ""zup"" corresponding to the last color, ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow
Analyzing the relationship between the input and output patterns, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" This deduction is made considering that whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears at its corresponding place in the output.

However, examining the second example:

Input: dax bluf lug wif
Output: green green blue red

In this example, ""bluf"" corresponds to blue instead of yellow, which is not consistent with the deduction made so far.

Evaluating the remaining examples with the assumption that ""bluf"" corresponds to either yellow or blue:

3rd Example:
Input: lug bluf dax lug
Output: blue blue green blue

In this case, ""bluf"" is followed by ""green,"" contradicting the original assumption that it should be yellow or blue.

4th Example:
Input: dax bluf zup
Output: green green yellow

Here, ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow,"" which again doesn't match the initial assumption.

5th Example:
Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

In this final example, ""bluf"" seems to be associated with the color yellow once again.

Upon further analysis and by cross-referencing all examples, it can be concluded that:

- Whenever ""bluf"" precedes another word, the corresponding color matches the color connected to that word (see 4th and 5th examples).
- If ""bluf"" succeeds a word, it takes on the color of that word (see 1st example: wif zup bluf).

The rule seems to be that ""bluf"" acts as a mimic or copycat, taking on the color of the word it precedes or follows.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the adjacent word.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" is associated with the repeated mentioning of a color corresponding to the word that precedes ""walm."" Let's analyze each example:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue."" The word ""lug"" seems to correspond to the color blue, and the presence of ""walm"" causes the word ""blue"" to be repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""lug walm dax"" translates to ""blue blue blue green."" Again, ""lug"" corresponds to blue and is repeated three times due to ""walm."" The word ""dax"" is added after ""walm,"" which corresponds to the color green.
- In the third example, ""dax walm wif dax"" translates to ""green green green red green."" Here, ""dax"" corresponds to green and is repeated three times due to ""walm."" The word ""wif"" is added after ""walm,"" which corresponds to the color red, followed by another ""dax"" for green.
- In the fourth example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green."" Like before, ""dax"" corresponds to green and is repeated three times due to ""walm.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax walm zup lug"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue."" ""Dax"" corresponds to green, repeated three times because of ""walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""lug"" corresponds to blue.

Based on the patterns above, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated a total of three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Rule: lug corresponds to the word ""blue"".
Observing the examples and the corresponding outputs, we can see a pattern in the meaning of the nonce word ""dax."" 

- When ""dax"" appears first in the sequence, the output is ""green.""
- The presence of ""dax"" later in the sequence also corresponds to the color ""green.""

The other words ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" and ""wif"" seem to be consistently associated with the same colors - ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" ""bluf"" with ""blue,"" and ""wif"" with ""red.""

Given this information, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green

The presence of ""dax"" within an input sequence will consistently result in the color ""green"" in the output sequence regardless of its position.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" consistently in every example provided.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" has a particular correlation with output. When observing the color that follows the word ""bluf,"" it is apparent that it corresponds to a color sequence that depends on the word preceding it. 

In the first example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug dax,"" and the output sequence is ""blue green green."" In this instance, it's not clear from the single instance what ""bluf"" translates to.

However, by examining further examples, we see a pattern emerge:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is blue (2nd and 4th examples).
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is green (3rd example).
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is red (4th and 5th examples).

It seems ""bluf"" takes on the value of the color associated with the word just before it:

bluf -> meaning: The meaning of ""bluf"" is the same color as the color represented by the word immediately preceding ""bluf"".

Rule: If X represents a color, then ""X bluf"" translates to ""color_of_X color_of_X"".
From the given examples, we can induce a rule for the nonce word ""walm."" Let's examine the pattern in each output related to the word ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""dax wif walm"" translates to ""green red red red."" The presence of ""walm"" resulted in a repetition of ""red"" three times.
- In the second example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue."" The presence of ""walm"" resulted in a repetition of ""blue"" three times.
- In the third example, ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" The presence of ""walm"" resulted in a repetition of ""yellow"" three times.
- In the fourth example, ""zup lug walm wif walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue red red red."" The presence of ""walm"" resulted in a repetition of the color preceding it three times (""blue"" and then ""red"").
- In the fifth example, ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow."" The presence of ""walm"" resulted in a repetition of ""red"" three times.

Based on these observations, ""walm"" suggests repetition of the color word that precedes it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the color mentioned just before it, three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" translates consistently to the color ""blue."" Each time the input contains the word ""lug,"" the output includes the word ""blue."" The other words ""wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""walm"" correspond to other colors or a sequence of colors, but ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input or the presence of other words. Therefore, the rule can be succinctly described as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, we can try to identify the pattern associated with the nonce word ""wif."" Let's look at the input and output pairings:

- Whenever ""wif lug"" appears in the input, ""red blue"" appears in the output.
- When ""wif bluf"" appears in the input, ""red red"" appears in the output.
- The word ""wif"" followed by another word seems to result in ""red"" followed by the color that the second word represents.

By examining the pattern, it seems that ""wif"" translates into the color ""red,"" and it also requires translating the following word into its associated color. We can establish the color associations for the other words based on their consistent pairings with colors in the output sequences:

- lug -> blue
- bluf -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow

Using these associations, we can then construct the following rule:

wif -> meaning. Rule: The word ""wif"" changes to ""red,"" and the word that comes right after ""wif"" is also translated into its corresponding color.
Rule: zup -> yellow

The repeated consistent response to the input ""zup"" is ""yellow"", indicating that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to multiple color words in the output. To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to compare the outputs when the word ""bluf"" is included to see if there is a pattern that correlates with its occurrence.

Examining the outputs, we notice that ""bluf"" is followed by different colors depending on its position and the surrounding context. Therefore, we can infer that ""bluf"" is not tied to a single color but represents a sequence or combination of colors influenced by the words around it. Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - Here, ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue"" and then the pattern continues with ""yellow"" which seems to be associated with both ""zup"" and ""walm.""

2. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
   - In this case, ""bluf"" is followed by two instances of ""red,"" which might be due to the preceding word ""wif.""

3. Input: wif zup bluf lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue
   - Here, ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue"" possibly due to the preceding sequence of ""wif zup.""

4. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
   Output: green red green yellow yellow
   - ""Bluf"" is succeeded by ""yellow"" twice, which seems to come after the ""dax wif dax zup"" sequence.

5. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   - The occurrence of ""bluf"" leads to the sequence ""blue red red"" which comes after ""lug wif.""

Considering all the examples, it's challenging to deduce a definitive pattern as ""bluf"" is followed by different colors each time. However, given the available data, we can propose a tentative rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" could correspond to a rule where its meaning changes depending on the previous one or two words, leading to the output of a sequence of colors instead of one single color, and the exact colors outputted depend on the specific combination of words present before ""bluf.""

So, the meaning of ""bluf"" is context-dependent, and it seems to trigger a color or sequence of colors that differs based on the preceding words in its respective sequence. Further examples and possibly additional context would be needed to refine this rule and better understand the exact mechanics of how ""bluf"" determines the resultant colors.
Observing the examples provided, it seems that the instances of the word ""walm"" correspond to a repetition of the color that comes from translating the word that precedes it. To confirm the rule, let us examine each example:

- In the first example, ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm"" we observe ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and after ""walm"" we see ""blue"" repeated three times.
- In the third example, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated three times.
- In the fourth example, ""wif dax"" translates to ""red green,"" and after ""walm,"" we see ""green"" repeated three times (only considering the immediate predecessor).
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and after ""walm"" we see ""blue"" repeated three times.

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the translated color of the immediately preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Lug translates to the color blue in these examples. Each instance of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of position or surrounding words.
Rule: dax -> green

The word 'dax' consistently translates to the color 'green' in all given examples.
wif -> red

Rule: In each example, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of its position within the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to look at the examples provided and identify any consistent patterns corresponding to when ""zup"" is used.

In the first two examples, ""zup wif"" consistently maps to ""yellow red,"" which shows that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" since ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red.""

The third example, ""lug zup dax lug,"" maps to ""blue yellow green blue."" Here, we see ""lug"" at the beginning and end of the input corresponding to ""blue"" at the beginning and end of the output. ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" is again mapping to ""yellow.""

The fourth example, ""zup dax bluf,"" maps to ""yellow green green."" As previously seen, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" is first in the sequence, mapping to ""yellow,"" just like in the prior examples. The repetition of ""green"" does not involve ""zup,"" so it can be inferred that ""bluf"" may correspond to ""green"" as well.

The fifth example, ""lug zup walm lug,"" maps to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" at the beginning and end, and ""walm"" seems to correspond to ""yellow."" Since ""zup"" is again associated with ""yellow,"" it supports the previous inference that ""zup"" maps to ""yellow.""

Putting it together, we get:

zup -> yellow

Rule: ""zup"" consistently means ""yellow"" in every sequence it appears.
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the word that comes before ""bluf"".
- In ""dax wif dax zup bluf,"" the word before ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow.""
- In ""lug bluf,"" the word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" repeats that color, resulting in ""blue blue.""
- In ""dax bluf,"" the word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""bluf"" repeats that color, resulting in ""green green.""
- In ""zup bluf,"" the word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" repeats that color, resulting in ""yellow yellow.""
- In ""lug wif bluf,"" the word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""bluf"" repeats that color, resulting in ""red red.""

Therefore: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in each given example.

1. When the input ""lug dax walm wif"" is given, the output is a sequence that includes the colors ""blue green green green red."" Looking at the sequence, we can notice that the color green is repeated three times, which is the same number of times the word ""walm"" is mentioned in the sequence. The word ""wif"" translates to red, while ""lug"" and ""dax"" translate to blue and green, respectively. 

2. For the input ""zup walm,"" which repeats thrice, we get ""yellow yellow yellow"" as output. ""Zup"" is associated with the color yellow, and since ""walm"" is mentioned once, it seems like ""walm"" also translates to yellow.

3. The input ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" corresponds to the output ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" In this example, ""bluf"" translates to blue and ""lug"" to blue as well, but ""zup"" and ""walm"" are associated with the color yellow.

4. With the input ""dax lug walm"" and the output ""green blue blue blue,"" we again see that ""lug"" translates to blue and ""dax"" to green. ""Walm"" seems to translate to blue since after ""lug"" and ""dax,"" we have three instances of blue in a row.

5. The input ""zup walm"" is identical to the second example and has the same output ""yellow yellow yellow,"" reinforcing our earlier observation that both ""zup"" and ""walm"" correspond to yellow.

By looking at the use of the nonce word ""walm"" in different contexts where it correlates with a specific color in the output, we can induce that the word ""walm"" means to repeat the last mentioned color in the sequence before it. When it is the first color mentioned, as in examples 2 and 5, it seems to default to yellow, but this pattern might be coincidental rather than a rule, as we do not have enough data about its usage at the start of a sequence independently from the word ""zup.""

Rule: ""walm"" -> repeat the last mentioned color in the sequence. If it is the first color mentioned, it might default to yellow, though more examples would be needed to confirm this as a rule.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,176
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue.

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. When ""lug"" is used alone or in combination with other words, ""blue"" is part of the output. ""Wif"" corresponds to red, and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
Based on the examples provided:

- ""dax lug dax"" translates to ""green blue green,"" suggesting that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""dax"" on its own outputs ""green,"" further supporting that ""dax"" means ""green.""
- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" which indicates that ""walm"" does not change the output, possibly meaning it also translates to ""green"" or is a repeat instruction for the word ""dax.""
- ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue red green green red."" Here, ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" while ""wif"" mirrors ""red,"" and ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow."" ""bluf"" appears to duplicate the color that follows it.
- ""lug zup bluf dax"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow green."" Here, ""lug"" and ""zup"" maintain their correspondence to ""blue"" and ""yellow,"" respectively, ""bluf"" duplicates the next color (yellow), and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Given this consistent interpretation across examples, the rule for ""dax"" appears to be:

dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" 

Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" is produced in the output at the corresponding position. This is a direct mapping from ""wif"" to ""red"" that does not change regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the sequence or the other words around it. 

Thus, the rule is:

wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, each nonce word seems to correspond to a particular color:

- wif corresponds to red
- dax corresponds to green
- bluf corresponds to yellow
- lug corresponds to blue
- zup corresponds to yellow

Given the word ""zup"" always results in ""yellow"" as the output and there's no evidence it changes based on context, we can conclude that:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" correlates with the color ""green.""

When ""bluf"" appears in the output, it is represented as “green.” However, if ""bluf"" appears following the word ""dax"" or ""wif,"" it changes to ""green red."" This suggests that ""bluf"" itself translates to ""green,"" but is affected by the preceding word which leads to an additional ""red"" in the sequence.

Considering the patterns provided:

- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" when following ""wif,"" otherwise ""green"" (but note the ""green red"" pattern when followed by ""bluf"")
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red""
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue""
- ""bluf"" alone correlates with ""yellow""

So, following the rule induction from these examples:

Rule: bluf -> ""green,"" with special consideration when preceded by ""dax"" or ""wif,"" leading to an additional ""red"" in the output.
To deduce the rule for ""walm,"" let's consider the instances in which it occurs and the corresponding outputs:

1. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green
2. dax walm wif zup -> green green green red yellow
3. lug walm zup -> blue blue blue yellow
4. zup walm lug zup wif dax -> yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
5. dax walm zup lug -> green green green yellow blue

Looking at these examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" in an input causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it for three times in a row. It ignores the color associated with ""walm"" itself and then continues the pattern with the color associated with the word after ""walm."" 

From the given examples:

- In example 1, ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" so after ""walm,"" we have ""blue blue blue"" and then the pattern continues with ""green"" for ""dax.""
- In example 2, ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" so after ""walm,"" we have ""green green green,"" then the pattern continues with ""red"" for ""wif"" followed by ""yellow"" for ""zup.""
- In example 3, the same principle applies with ""lug"" leading to three ""blue"" outputs and then the pattern continues with ""yellow"" for ""zup.""
- In example 4, ""zup"" results in three ""yellow"" outputs after ""walm,"" then the pattern continues normally.
- In example 5, ""dax"" leads to three ""green"" outputs after ""walm,"" and then the pattern continues.

Based on this pattern, we can deduce that:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the output color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"" to be repeated three times, and then the sequence continues as normal with the next word after ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif walm lug

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the English language. Each occurrence of ""lug"" in the input results in the word ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, we can infer that each unique input word is consistently translated to a unique color in the output. Here are the observations we can make from the patterns given:

- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green""
- ""walm"" and ""bluf"" don't have enough instances to determine their translations with absolute certainty, but in the examples provided, ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".

Given that we are focusing solely on the word ""dax,"" we can see it translates to ""green"" every time it appears.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in every example given.
zup -> yellow

Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" is followed by a repetition of the color that was previously mentioned (or implied) in the sequence, with ""dax"" meaning green, ""wif"" meaning red, ""lug"" meaning blue, and ""zup"" meaning yellow. If ""bluf"" appears after a color-indicating word, it repeats that color twice in the output. If ""bluf"" appears without a preceding color-indicating word, it is not defined in this context.

Therefore,

bluf -> Repeat the previously mentioned color twice. If no color is mentioned before ""bluf"", the rule cannot be applied.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's first look at each instance where ""walm"" appears and see if there's a pattern in the outputs:

In the first example:
Input: lug walm zup 
Output: blue blue blue yellow
Here, ""lug"" appears to map to ""blue"", and ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"". ""walm"" appears between the two and is followed by ""blue"".

In the second example:
Input: dax walm wif dax 
Output: green green green red green
Here, ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""wif"" is ""red"". ""walm"" appears between ""dax"" and ""wif"" and each time is followed by ""green"".

In the third example:
Input: lug walm 
Output: blue blue blue
Here, ""lug"" is followed by multiple ""blue"", and ""walm"" appears just after it, which seems to result in repeated ""blue"".

In the fourth example:
Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif 
Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
""lug"" maps to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" and ""zup"", resulting in a sequence of ""blue"" and ""yellow"" respectively.

In the fifth example:
Input: wif zup walm dax zup 
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
Here, ""wif"" is ""red"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""dax"" is ""green"". ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes a sequence of ""yellow"".

Observations and Induction:
1. The appearance of ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color that would have been output by the word before it. For instance, ""lug"" by itself mapped to a single ""blue,"" but when followed by ""walm,"" the output was three ""blue"" in a row. This pattern holds in all instances.
   
2. ""walm"" does not seem to be associated with any new color. Its function is rather to replicate the output color of the previous word.

Rule:
From these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated two additional times. In other words, if the word before ""walm"" results in a single color output, the presence of ""walm"" will cause that color to be output a total of three times in succession.

Therefore:
walm -> Repeat the color output of the previous word two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,178
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present.
Rule: dax -> green

The nonce word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in each given example. Regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words around it, ""dax"" always results in the output ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: 'wif' translates to the color red in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in each example provided.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should analyze the pattern of inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. **Input**: wif zup dax bluf
   **Output**: red yellow green green
   
   - We can see that ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the color is green again after ""dax.""

2. **Input**: zup lug zup bluf lug
   **Output**: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
   
   - In this example, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" which is the same as the preceding word ""zup.""

3. **Input**: wif bluf lug
   **Output**: red red blue
   
   - Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and takes on the color ""red,"" which is the same as ""wif.""

4. **Input**: wif zup bluf lug walm
   **Output**: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   
   - ""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" again and the output is another ""yellow."" ""Lug"" and ""walm"" both follow as blue.

5. **Input**: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   **Output**: red red green green red red red blue red
   
   - ""Bluf"" again repeats the color of the word it follows: after ""wif"" it's red; after ""dax"" it's green.

From these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> Takes on the color associated with the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning or rule governing the nonce word ""walm,"" we should inspect each instance where it occurs and compare the input with the corresponding output.

From the given examples, we can see that every time ""walm"" is present, a series of three identical colors follows in the output. We can also notice that these colors depend on the word that precedes ""walm."" We can analyze the input-output pairs to correlate the preceding word with the color:

- ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red"" (the word before ""walm"" is ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"")
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"" (the word before ""walm"" is ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"")
- ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" -> ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow"" (the words before ""walm"" are ""wif"" and ""zup,"" which correspond to ""red"" and ""yellow,"" respectively)
- ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" -> ""green green green red blue green green green"" (the words before ""walm"" are ""dax"" corresponding to ""green"")

Given these observations, it appears that ""walm"" takes the color associated with the word directly preceding it and triples its occurrence in the output.

Rule: walm -> meaning. When ""walm"" follows a word, it repeats the color associated with that word three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup
    ",Output: blue yellow,blue yellow,True,179
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in every given example.
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red""
- ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""green"" when it appears after ""zup"" or ""dax""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"", regardless of its position in the sequence

The input-output pairs do not show any dependencies or variations in the meaning of ""dax"" based on its position or the words around it. In each instance, regardless of what other words are present or the order of the words, ""dax"" is always translated to ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at each instance where the word appears and the output it corresponds to.

1. In the first example, ""dax wif zup"" translates to ""green red yellow."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
2. In the second example, ""lug dax wif"" translates to ""blue green red."" ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" ""Wif"" again corresponds to ""red.""
3. In the third example, ""zup lug bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue blue red."" Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""
4. In the fourth example, ""dax wif lug dax"" translates to ""green red blue green."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""
5. In the fifth example, ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" translates to ""blue green green yellow blue red."" ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""bluf"" to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

Based on the given examples, ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in every instance, regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: ""zup"" means ""yellow."" 

Every time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Other words such as ""dax,"" ""bluf,"" and ""wif"" correlate with different colors, but consistently, ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow.""
From the examples provided, each instance of the word ""bluf"" corresponds to an output of two ""red"" colors. Looking at the patterns, other words also correspond to specific colors (e.g., ""dax"" equals green, ""wif"" equals red, ""zup"" equals yellow, and ""lug"" equals blue). The color output corresponds to the order of the words in the input, and each word seems to be directly translated into a color.

Based on this pattern, the rule appears to be that each word translates to a specific color, with ""bluf"" consistently translating to two reds in sequence.

Rule: bluf -> red red
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the given examples and outputs systematically:

1. ""zup lug walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue""
2. ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" -> ""green blue blue blue green red red green""
3. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow""
4. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
5. ""dax zup walm wif"" -> ""green yellow yellow yellow red""

It appears that the word ""walm"" produces a sequence of repeated colors in the output. Specifically, the color before ""walm"" repeats three times in the output. Let's check this pattern with the given examples:

1. ""zup lug walm"" -> The color before ""walm"" is ""blue,"" and then ""blue"" is repeated three times.
2. ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" -> The color before ""walm"" is again ""blue,"" and again ""blue"" is repeated three times.
3. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" -> The color before ""walm"" is ""yellow,"" and ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
4. ""dax lug walm"" -> The color before ""walm"" is ""blue,"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times.
5. ""dax zup walm wif"" -> The color before ""walm"" is ""yellow,"" and ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

Based on this analysis, we can define the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,180
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" correlates to the color blue in the examples provided.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each word corresponds to a color:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- walm -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green

Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""green.""

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" The word ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red"" regardless of its position in the input string.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""zup"" translates to a specific color in the output. The color that ""zup"" results in does not seem to vary based on position or the surrounding words, assuming that each input word corresponds to a single color in the output. We have the following correspondences:

- wif walm zup -> red red red yellow
- lug zup dax wif zup -> blue yellow green red yellow
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow
- lug zup lug -> blue yellow blue
- dax bluf wif lug zup -> green green red blue yellow

In every case, regardless of its position, ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. There is no example where ""zup"" translates to any other color or result. Thus, the rule can be stated as:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" represents the color ""yellow"".
Based on the examples provided, each word appears to translate into a specific color with a repetition based on the individual word. For instance, ""lug"" translates into ""blue"" repeated three times, ""wif"" translates into ""red"" repeated twice, and ""zup"" translates into ""yellow"" repeated twice.

Here's what we can infer from the examples:

- ""lug walm wif bluf"" outputs ""blue blue blue red red."" Since ""lug"" is before ""bluf"" and ""wif"" outputs are known from other examples, we can remove those to isolate ""bluf.""
- ""zup bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow,"" and we know from the other example that ""zup"" alone yields ""yellow yellow."" Therefore, ""bluf"" does not add any additional output here.
- ""wif bluf lug zup"" outputs ""red red blue yellow,"" so by isolating ""bluf,"" knowing ""wif"" is ""red red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue blue blue,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow yellow,"" we would see ""bluf"" appears to have no output.
- ""dax bluf wif"" outputs ""green green red,"" and knowing ""wif"" is ""red red,"" ""bluf"" must be associated with ""green green"" since ""dax"" proceeds ""bluf"" here.
- ""dax bluf"" outputs ""green green."" This is consistent with the last example.

From this information, it appears that ""bluf"" means nothing on its own—its presence in an input string doesn't add any colors to the output string. However, ""bluf"" seems to affect the color output corresponding to the word it is paired with if that word precedes ""bluf."" In the two instances where we can isolate its effect (""dax bluf""), we see that it causes ""dax"" to output ""green green.""

Initially, this seems confusing because ""bluf"" precedes ""lug"" in one example and we don't see a repeat of ""blue,"" as would be expected if ""bluf"" caused the previous word to repeat its color. This inconsistency suggests that either ""bluf"" changes meaning depending on context, or that there is another rule at play we have not yet understood.

However, from the examples where ""bluf"" strictly follows another word, we can see that the output color is repeated twice. Thus, the best rule we can identify based on the given information is:

Rule: When preceded by a certain word (demonstrated by ""dax"" in the examples), ""bluf"" makes that word's color output repeat twice without adding any additional colors of its own.

Without more examples or information, we cannot further refine this rule or address the exceptions.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's first look for patterns that change in the input relative to the output.

1. In instances where ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is a series of three ""blue"" followed by the color that ""wif"" represents (which is ""red""). This seems to indicate that ""walm"" may mean to repeat the color represented by the previous word three times.
   
   For example: 
   - ""lug walm wif bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red red""
   - ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red blue blue""

2. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is a series of three ""red,"" suggesting the same pattern of ""walm"" causing a repetition of the color represented by the word before it.

   For example:
   - ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow""
   - ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green green green red""

3. Regardless of the word that comes after ""walm,"" it doesn’t seem to affect the rule observed for ""walm,"" since that word determines the colors that come after the three repeated colors. The pattern holds true regardless of the word that follows ""walm.""

Therefore, we can postulate the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color represented by the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup lug walm zup lug
    ",Output: yellow blue blue blue yellow blue,yellow blue blue blue yellow blue,True,181
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word 'lug' translates to the color 'blue' in each instance it appears across the examples provided.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a certain color:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""

The word ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red"" in the examples provided. Therefore, we can deduce that:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow. 

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
To induce the rule, let's look at the correlation between the input and output phrases given in the examples.

Consider these two examples first:
- Input: wif bluf lug dax wif => Output: red red blue green red
- Input: wif bluf lug => Output: red red blue

In these examples, 'wif' corresponds to 'red', 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', and 'dax' corresponds to 'green'. Since 'bluf' appears between two 'red' in the output, it suggests that 'bluf' also corresponds to 'red'. However, if we consider other examples, this is not the case.

If we look at another example:
- Input: zup dax bluf => Output: yellow green green

Here 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', and 'dax' to 'green'. Following the output sequence, 'bluf' corresponds to 'green' in this example, not 'red'.

Taking another example for further analysis:
- Input: dax bluf wif zup lug => Output: green green red yellow blue

Here again, 'dax' corresponds to 'green', followed by 'bluf', which also corresponds to 'green' in the output.

When looking at all examples, we can see that 'bluf' takes on the color of the word that precedes it. Therefore, the rule seems to be that 'bluf' mimics the color of the previous word in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the previous word in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, walm appears to be associated with a repetition of a color word. Let's look at the patterns:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue"". Here, the word ""lug"" seems to be associated with the color blue, and ""walm"" causes the color to be repeated three times.
  
- In the second example, ""lug wif walm"" translates to ""blue red red red"". This suggests ""wif"" is associated with the color red, and ""walm"" once again causes the preceding color to be repeated three times.

- The third example, ""lug walm zup walm"", outputs ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow"". Here, ""zup"" seems to be associated with the color yellow, and ""walm"" causes the preceding color to be repeated three times for each occurrence of ""walm"".

- In the fourth example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" maps to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue"". Noting the new appearances of ""bluf"" and ""dax"" which map to ""blue"" and ""green"" respectively, ""lug walm"" within the sequence still corresponds to ""blue blue blue"". It indicates that the presence of ""lug"" followed by ""walm"" has its consistent rule of repeating ""blue"" three times, despite the presence of other colors and words.

- The fifth example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm"", corresponds to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"". This continues the pattern that ""walm"" causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times, as seen with ""lug walm"" leading to ""blue blue blue"".

Rule:
Walm -> Repeats the previously mentioned color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup dax wif
    ",Output: green yellow green red,green yellow green red,True,182
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"". Here's how we can break down each example:

- In the first example, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" followed by ""lug"" which translates to ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" followed by ""lug"" which translates to ""blue.""
- In the third example, the pattern repeats with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"" every time it appears. We can also deduce that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""dax"" remains ""green."" This is supported by the single word translations in the other examples.
- In the fourth example, again ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" once again to ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule for ""lug"" is consistent throughout the examples, and we can conclude:

lug -> blue. Rule: When ""lug"" appears, it translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position or surrounding context.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we can compare the outputs from each input that contains ""dax.""

In every instance where ""dax"" is present in the input string, the word ""green"" consistently appears in the output string:

- wif dax -> red green
- zup dax wif -> yellow green red
- dax lug -> green blue
- dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
- dax zup -> green yellow

The common factor here is that regardless of its position in the input string, whenever ""dax"" appears, ""green"" also appears in the output string. This implies that the word ""dax"" correlates directly to the word ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it's possible to deduce the meaning of ""wif."" Each time the word ""wif"" appears, the output includes the color ""red."" Additionally, ""wif"" is followed by other words that correspond to other colors. Here are the associations from the examples:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""

With this information, we can infer that ""wif"" by itself represents the color ""red"" and does not seem to be affected by the position within the input sequence or the surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates directly to the color ""yellow"" in all provided examples.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" represents the repetition of the color that immediately precedes it. For each example given, the color that appears just before ""bluf"" is repeated in the output after ""bluf.""

Here is the analysis:

1. ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" outputs ""blue red blue green green."" Here, ""green"" is the color before ""bluf"" and is repeated after it.
   
2. ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" outputs ""green red green yellow yellow."" ""Yellow"" comes before ""bluf"" and is followed by another ""yellow.""

3. ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" outputs ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue."" The ""yellow"" before ""bluf"" is repeated after it, before the final ""blue.""

4. ""zup bluf dax lug"" outputs ""yellow yellow green blue."" The color before ""bluf"" is ""yellow,"" and it is indeed repeated immediately after ""bluf.""

5. ""wif lug zup bluf"" outputs ""red blue yellow yellow."" Here again, ""yellow"" precedes ""bluf"" and is then doubled in the output.

Rule: bluf -> The color word preceding ""bluf"" is repeated in the output.
Rule: walm -> repeats the color corresponding to the word that precedes it.

Explanation:
1. ""wif bluf dax walm"" outputs ""red red green green green"". Here, walm follows ""dax,"" and since ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, walm outputs green twice, following the green for ""dax.""

2. ""lug walm wif zup wif"" outputs ""blue blue blue red yellow red"". In this case, walm follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, thus walm outputs blue twice before moving on to the next color red for ""wif.""

3. ""dax walm zup lug"" outputs ""green green green yellow blue"". Here, walm follows ""dax"" again and thus repeats the green color twice.

4. ""dax lug walm"" outputs ""green blue blue blue"". Walm follows ""lug"" this time and repeats the blue color twice after the first blue for ""lug.""

5. ""wif walm dax zup"" outputs ""red red red green yellow"". As in the first example, walm follows ""wif"" and repeats the color red twice.

Based on the given examples, the rule can be established that walm repeats the color of the word immediately before it. The number of repetitions is not fully clear from the examples but seems to be at least one or more.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax walm lug
    ",Output: blue green green green blue,blue green green green blue,True,183
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples where the input including ""lug"" is paired with a specific output, it is possible to deduce the meaning or rule behind ""lug"". Each instance of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.

Here are the relations based on the provided examples:

- Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
- Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
- Input: lug -> Output: blue
- Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup -> Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
- Input: lug dax walm wif -> Output: blue green green green red

Looking closely at each occurrence, ""lug"" always translates to ""blue"" in the output sequence, independent of its position within the input.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:
lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color green regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided:

- ""wif"" is always followed by the color ""red,"" whether it's at the beginning or in the middle of the sequence.
- The positions of ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" ""zup,"" and ""dax"" in the sequence affect their corresponding color output. For instance, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" when following ""wif,"" and ""bluf,"" which typically translates to ""blue,"" changes to ""red"" when immediately following ""wif.""

Thus, it seems that ""wif"" serves as a modifier or indicator for the color that follows it. Particularly, it changes the following word's corresponding color to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> changes the following word's corresponding output color to ""red.""
Rule: zup -> yellow

The meaning of ""zup"" is the color ""yellow"", as evidenced by every instance of ""zup"" in the input being translated to ""yellow"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to find consistent patterns in the given examples. Here's the breakdown:

1. ""dax wif bluf"" -> ""green red red""
2. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
3. ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" -> ""blue red red green blue blue""
4. ""dax lug bluf wif"" -> ""green blue blue red""
5. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""

Let's compare the colors associated with known words:

- ""dax"" always leads to ""green"" when it is the first word, otherwise the color changes.
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" if it's preceded by another color, and when it is not at the end of the sequence.
- ""lug"" changes the output to ""blue"" most of the time but the second occurrence's color seems dependent on the word that precedes it.
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow.""

Now, looking at how ""bluf"" affects the output:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax wif,"" it results in ""red"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it results in ""yellow"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug wif,"" it results in ""red"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax lug,"" it results in ""blue"".
- When ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" it results in ""blue"".

There is no clear pattern based only on the word that precedes ""bluf."" However, there is a noticeable consistency: ""bluf"" has the same output color as the word immediately before it. This suggests that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word, with an exception at the end of the third example, where it doesn't repeat ""green"" from ""lug"" but continues with ""blue."" However, this could be influenced by what follows ""bluf"" or an anomaly due to the presence of multiple instances of ""bluf.""

Hence, the preliminary rule for ""bluf"" could be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Repeats the color of the preceding word.

This rule seems to apply most consistently across the given examples, taking the last word's output before ""bluf"" except where more complex patterns may override it, or assuming there may be additional context not provided by these examples.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the outputs in relation to its appearance in the inputs:

- In the first example, ""wif walm zup walm"" produces ""red red red yellow yellow yellow."" The repeated ""walm"" has a consistent output of ""yellow yellow yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""dax walm zup walm"" leads to ""green green green yellow yellow yellow."" Like the first example, ""walm"" relates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" and ""dax"" associates with ""green.""
- In the third example, ""dax wif walm lug zup,"" the output is ""green red red red blue yellow."" From this, ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
- The fourth example, ""wif walm lug bluf,"" results in ""red red red blue blue."" Here, ""walm"" corresponds with ""red,"" which is the same as ""wif."" This might initially seem to contradict previous assumptions, but it could be influenced by the absence of a second ""walm.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif dax zup walm,"" the output is ""red green yellow yellow yellow."" As before, ""walm"" results in a sequence of three ""yellow.""

From these observations, it seems like ""walm"" does not have a fixed color but results in a sequence of three of the same color. However, when used a second time, it directly correlates with the color ""yellow."" Additionally, in the fourth example, there is only one ""walm,"" and it produces an output of ""red,"" which matches the color associated with ""wif"" earlier in the sequence, suggesting that the meaning of ""walm"" might be contingent on the preceding word or the composition of the sequence.

Rule: When ""walm"" is used once in a sequence, it might take on the color (output) of the word preceding it. When ""walm"" appears more than once in a sequence or at the end, it translates to a repetition of three of the color ""yellow.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm
    ",Output: green green green,green green green,True,184
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Explanation:

- In all instances where ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue.""
- ""wif"" corresponds with ""red,"" ""walm"" and the repetition of ""blue"" in the output, ""bluf"" corresponds with ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" corresponds with ""green."" Thus, by process of elimination and consistent association across different sentences, ""lug"" is determined to mean ""blue.""
Examining the patterns in the examples provided where the nonce word ""dax"" appears, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule behind ""dax.""

1. When ""lug dax"" occurs, the output is ""blue green.""
2. The sequence ""dax walm wif"" leads to the output ""green green green red.""
3. The sequence ""lug wif dax wif"" results in the output ""blue red green red.""
4. Standalone ""dax"" following ""zup"" corresponds to ""green.""

From this, it seems that whenever ""dax"" appears, the output is consistently ""green."" There is no contextual change or other words affecting this output tied to the appearance of ""dax."" Therefore, we can deduce the nonce word ""dax"" maps directly to the color ""green,"" irrespective of its position or surrounding words.

Rule: dax -> green. ""Dax"" means the color green.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" seems to correspond to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. Other words correspond to different colors; for example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples given, it seems that ""zup"" determines the color that is stated next in the series. However, it does not determine a specific color, but rather its role seems to be to repeat the color that was stated immediately before it in the sequence. Here's how:

1. ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" turns into ""green red green yellow yellow."" We can see that ""zup"" follows ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" and then ""zup"" becomes ""yellow,"" which means it takes on the color stated directly before it (green).

2. ""dax lug zup dax"" becomes ""green blue yellow green."" The ""zup"" appears after ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" and ""zup"" then becomes ""yellow."" Here, it follows the rule of repeating the color before it again.

3. ""zup bluf wif dax lug"" turns into ""yellow yellow red green blue."" ""Zup"" appears in the beginning this time and takes on the color ""yellow,"" which is also the color stated immediately after it (bluf). This suggests that ""zup"" may have adopted the following color rather than the preceding one because there is no preceding color.

4. ""wif bluf lug zup"" becomes ""red red blue yellow."" In this case, ""zup"" takes on the color ""yellow,"" consistent with the color of ""lug,"" the word before it.

5. ""dax zup lug wif zup"" turns into ""green yellow blue red yellow."" We can see that ""zup"" first appears after ""dax"" which is ""green"" and it turns into ""yellow,"" the color just before it (green). It appears again at the end, after ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" and turns again into ""yellow,"" the last color before it (red).

Therefore, ""zup"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. If it is the first in the sequence, it might take the color following it. Since the inputs always result in ""yellow"" following ""zup,"" it is not conclusive with the given data whether ""zup"" always translates to ""yellow"" or if it changes based on context.

Rule: zup -> takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it in the sequence; if it begins the sequence, it is consistently ""yellow"" based on the given examples, but more data would be needed for a conclusive rule in this scenario.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the term ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""blue."" Here's how the deduction works:

1. In the first example, ""dax bluf lug wif"" translates to ""green green blue red."" The repeated word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in both the input and the output. Since ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"" and ""bluf"" also translates to ""blue"" in the same position, one might initially think that ""bluf"" could be a synonym or alternative for ""lug.""

2. However, looking at the second example, ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" outputs ""blue red red green blue blue,"" we notice that ""bluf"" still translates to ""blue"" even when it is not in the same position as ""lug."" This suggests that ""bluf"" has a consistent meaning regardless of its position and is not contextually dependent in this set of examples.

3. The third example, ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" results in ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red,"" where ""bluf"" continues to map to ""blue.""

4. The fourth example, ""lug bluf wif,"" reinforces this, with ""bluf"" yet again corresponding to ""blue.""

5. Similarly, the fifth example, ""zup lug zup bluf lug,"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue,"" where ""bluf"" is shown to mean ""blue"" once more.

Therefore, the rule deduced is:

bluf -> blue
Based on the examples provided, the word `walm` seems to translate into a sequence of repetitions of the color word that precedes it. Specifically, `walm` appears to cause the last color word to be repeated three times. Let's analyze the examples in detail:

1. lug zup dax walm -> blue yellow green green green
- The color before `walm` is green (`dax`), and after `walm` we see green repeated three times.

2. zup wif dax walm -> yellow red green green green
- The color before `walm` is green (`dax`), and after `walm` we see green repeated three times.

3. lug wif lug walm zup walm wif -> blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
- The first `walm` comes after blue (`lug`), resulting in blue repeated three times.
- The next `walm` comes after yellow (`zup`), resulting in yellow repeated three times.

4. zup walm dax lug -> yellow yellow yellow green blue
- The `walm` comes after yellow (`zup`), resulting in yellow repeated three times.

5. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green
- The `walm` comes after blue (`lug`), resulting in blue repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the previous color word three times.


    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup wif zup
    ",Output: yellow red yellow,yellow red yellow,True,185
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word 'lug' translates to the color 'blue' in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following color associations for the nonce word and other words:

1. dax -> green
2. lug -> blue
3. wif -> red
4. walm -> green
5. zup -> yellow
6. bluf -> red

It's interesting to note that the word ""walm"" also outputs the color green, which is the same output as for ""dax"". However, given the consistency of ""dax"" always resulting in ""green"" regardless of its position, we can more confidently associate ""dax"" specifically with the color green, whereas ""walm"" outputting green could be due to different rules that we do not have enough information to understand.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. Every instance of the word ""wif"" is matched with the word ""red"" in the output. Additionally, it seems that other nonce words correspond to other colors: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" to a repeated ""red.""

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red

Meaning that ""wif"" represents the color red.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" There does not appear to be any other context or variation in its usage that would alter its meaning. Thus, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word. Here are the observations that lead to this conclusion:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue."" ""Bluf"" also outputs ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" twice and outputs ""blue"" twice, it then follows ""wif"" and outputs ""red.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and outputs ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and outputs ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and outputs ""green.""

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at each example and try to identify patterns:

1. `zup wif walm lug` -> `yellow red red red blue`
2. `dax walm wif bluf` -> `green green green red red`
3. `zup lug walm wif dax` -> `yellow blue blue blue red green`
4. `lug walm` -> `blue blue blue`
5. `zup lug walm wif walm` -> `yellow blue blue blue red red red`

We can observe that the position of ""walm"" in the input corresponds to repeated occurrences of a color in the output. The color that is repeated is based on the word that follows ""walm.""

1. ""walm lug"" translates to ""red red red"" with ""lug"" translating to ""blue"".
2. ""walm wif"" translates to ""green green green"" with ""wif"" translating to ""red"".
3. In the third example, the pattern holds with ""walm wif"" leading to ""blue blue blue"" and ""wif"" alone translating to ""red"".
4. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" implying that ""walm"" on its own also leads to a triplet of the following color word, and since ""lug"" follows ""walm"", it results in three ""blue"".
5. The fifth case supports the previous observations with ""walm wif walm"" resulting in ""red red red red red red"".

Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color word that comes after it to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> the following color word is repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,186
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Upon examining the examples provided, it is possible to muse that 'lug' maps to a particular output irrespective of its position in the input sequence. Thus, one can attempt to discern the underlying rule by correlating 'lug' to its consistent output across different contexts.

Analyzing the given inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. ""wif lug"" leads to ""red blue"".
2. ""lug walm dax"" leads to ""blue blue blue green"".
3. ""lug zup dax wif"" leads to ""blue yellow green red"".
4. ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"".
5. ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" leads to ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue"".

In every output sequence, whenever 'lug' appears in the input, 'blue' appears in the corresponding position in the output. No matter where 'lug' is presented in the sequence—whether it's at the beginning, middle, or end—the output remains 'blue'.

Thus, we can conclude that 'lug' maps to the output 'blue'.

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

The output ""green"" consistently follows the input ""dax,"" regardless of the context or the presence of other nonce words. This pattern suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" always seems to correspond to the color red in the output. Each appearance of ""wif"" is translated to ""red"" regardless of its position in the input string. Therefore, the meaning can be deduced as follows:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" means ""red"".
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the color ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be:

bluf -> green

However, if we look at the given inputs and their corresponding outputs carefully, we can notice something different. ""Bluf"" does not translate to ""green"" in any of the examples. Instead, it consistently translates to ""blue."" Here is the breakdown of the examples:

1. wif bluf lug -> red red blue
2. zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
3. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
4. zup wif dax wif bluf -> yellow red green red red
5. lug wif lug dax bluf -> blue red blue green green

Notice that in every input where ""bluf"" appears, the corresponding output word is ""blue.""

Therefore, the correct rule for the word ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" can be directly translated to the color that represents the immediately preceding word. To clarify, let's map the words to their corresponding colors:

- `dax` -> green
- `zup` -> yellow
- `lug` -> blue
- `wif` -> red

Now let's match the outputs to the inputs:

1. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   Here, ""walm"" following ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""walm"" following ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Here, ""walm"" following ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

3. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   Here, ""walm"" following ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

4. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   Here, ""walm"" following ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" following ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Here, ""walm"" following ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" translates to the color of the word immediately preceding it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup bluf
    ",Output: green yellow blue,green yellow yellow,False,187
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in every example provided. 
Based on the examples provided, it appears that 'dax' consistently translates to 'green'. Regardless of the position of 'dax' in the input sequence or the other words surrounding it, the output is always 'green'. Therefore, the rule here would be:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
Analyzing the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" can be determined based on its consistent association with a specific output color for each example.

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

Input: dax zup walm wif
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

Input: dax zup wif
Output: green yellow red

Input: wif dax zup
Output: red green yellow

Input: dax zup
Output: green yellow

Observations of ""zup"":
1. When ""zup"" directly follows ""dax,"" the output for ""zup"" is always yellow.
2. The color green seems to be associated with ""dax"" whenever it is the first word in the sequence.
3. The word ""wif"" when placed after ""zup"" gives an output of red, but when before ""dax zup"", it is associated with red as well.
4. The word ""bluf"" does not seem to affect the output color for ""zup""; it remains yellow.
5. The absence of any other words following ""dax zup"" still results in a yellow output for ""zup"".

Based on these observations, ""zup"" seems to encode for the output color yellow regardless of its position in the sequence, so long as it follows ""dax"". However, we do not have examples of ""zup"" occurring without ""dax"" or at the beginning of a sequence to confirm this without a doubt.

Rule:
zup -> translates to the output color yellow when it follows the word ""dax"". Without instances of ""zup"" in other contexts, the rule cannot be generalized beyond this specific condition.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look at the patterns in the input and output.

Reviewing the examples:

- When ""wif bluf dax"" is the input, the output is ""red red green."" ""Bluf"" is between ""wif"" and ""dax,"" which correspond to 'red' and 'green,' respectively. So ""bluf"" in this instance results in 'red.'

- When ""dax bluf"" is the input, the output is ""green green."" Here, ""dax"" corresponds to 'green' and is followed by ""bluf,"" which also results in 'green.'

- When ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" is the input, the output is ""red blue blue red yellow."" ""Bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to 'blue,' and is also represented as 'blue' in the output.

- When ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" is the input, the output is ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue."" ""Bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to 'yellow,' and ""bluf"" also produces 'yellow' in the output.

- Finally, when ""zup bluf"" is the input, the output is ""yellow yellow."" Again, ""zup"" corresponds to 'yellow,' and so does ""bluf"" in the output.

From these examples, it appears that ""bluf"" results in a color that is the same as the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it. The presence of ""bluf"" doesn't seem to have an effect on the words that follow it.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately before it in the sequence.
Given the examples, the word ""walm"" seems to affect the output sequence in a specific way. Looking at the frequency and the pattern of the output colors following ""walm"", it seems that ""walm"" causes the colors to repeat in the output according to the color that precedes ""walm"". Let's analyze each input and its corresponding output to extract the rule:

1. Input: ""wif dax lug walm""  
   Output: ""red green blue blue blue""  
   After ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated three times, which is the color corresponding to ""lug"".

2. Input: ""dax walm""  
   Output: ""green green green""  
   After ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated, which is the color corresponding to ""dax"".

3. Input: ""dax walm"" again gives the same output as the second example, which reinforces the previous observation.

4. Input: ""lug dax walm wif""  
   Output: ""blue green green green red""  
   After ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated three times, which is the color corresponding to ""dax"".

5. Input: ""dax lug wif walm""  
   Output: ""green blue red red red""  
   After ""walm"", ""red"" is repeated three times, which is the color corresponding to ""wif"".

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the last mentioned color thrice. Hence, the rule we can deduce here is:

Rule: walm -> causes the color that directly precedes it to be repeated three times in the output sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning ""blue""

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green."" The other words, ""lug"" and ""zup bluf,"" correspond to different colors, with ""lug"" translating to ""blue"" and both ""zup"" and ""bluf"" translating to ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green

This means that, regardless of what other words are present, ""dax"" always corresponds to the color green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"".
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Every instance where ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the exact same position in the output.

Here are the mappings from the examples:

- ""dax zup dax"" -> ""green yellow green""
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- ""wif zup bluf lug"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue""
- ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red green red red""
- ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" -> ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow""

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
bluf -> rule

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word immediately following it. If ""bluf"" is the last word, there is no color to take, so it defaults to blue.

Explanation:

1. dax bluf wif lug zup
   - dax: green
   - bluf: takes the color of the following word (wif), which is red
   - wif: red
   - lug: blue
   - zup: yellow

2. wif lug bluf
   - wif: red
   - lug: blue
   - bluf: since it's the last word, there is no color to take, and it defaults to blue

3. dax lug bluf wif
   - dax: green
   - lug: blue
   - bluf: takes the color of the following word (wif), which is red
   - wif: red

4. dax lug bluf dax
   - dax: green
   - lug: blue
   - bluf: takes the color of the following word (dax), which is green
   - dax: green

5. dax zup bluf
   - dax: green
   - zup: yellow
   - bluf: since it's the last word, there is no color to take, and it defaults to blue (based on previous examples where bluf defaults to blue when it's the last word)
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I will analyze the inputs and their corresponding outputs to determine any patterns that lead to the inclusion of the color ""yellow"" in the output sequence.

1. When ""lug walm zup lug walm"" is input, the output is ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue"". The sequence has ""lug"" resulting in blue both times, and ""zup"" at the beginning and end resulting in blue, with a single yellow corresponding to ""walm"".

2. For input ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"", the output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green."" Here ""lug"" also results in blue, ""zup"" now corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" to red, and ""dax"" to green. The yellow following ""walm"" suggests it may trigger the color that comes after it.

3. In input ""lug walm zup"", the output is ""blue blue blue yellow."" Again, ""lug"" correlates to blue, ""zup"" to yellow and ""walm"" is followed by yellow.

4. The input ""zup dax walm zup wif"" leads to ""yellow green green green yellow red."" Here we again see ""zup"" correlating to yellow, ""dax"" to green, and ""walm"" is followed by green this time.

5. With ""lug walm wif lug,"" the corresponding output is ""blue blue blue red blue."" Similar to previous patterns, ""lug"" leads to blue, ""wif"" to red, and ""walm"" is again followed by red.

The pattern that emerges is that the color following ""walm"" is repeated. Given that, ""walm"" seems to be a command for repetition of the next color in the output.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""walm"" means to repeat the color that follows it in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the following rule can be deduced:

Rule: lug -> blue

Each instance where the word 'lug' is present corresponds to the color 'blue' in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color green in each example.
To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the corresponding outputs for each input step-by-step.

1. Input: ""zup wif"" 
   Output: ""yellow red""

2. Input: ""wif bluf lug zup""
   Output: ""red red blue yellow""
   
3. Input: ""zup bluf wif walm""
   Output: ""yellow yellow red red red""
   
4. Input: ""zup bluf wif dax lug""
   Output: ""yellow yellow red green blue""

5. Input: ""wif lug bluf wif zup""
   Output: ""red blue blue red yellow""

Let's analyze the patterns:

- Whenever ""zup"" appears, ""yellow"" is added to the output sequence.
- When ""bluf"" appears, ""yellow"" is replaced by ""blue"" in the subsequent output. 
- ""lug"" leads to ""blue"" in the output.
- ""walm"" results in three ""red"" outputs, and ""dax"" gives us ""green"" followed by ""blue"".

Now let's focus on the occurrences of ""wif"":

- When ""wif"" is at the beginning or middle without a ""zup"" preceding it, it results in ""red"". When ""wif"" follows a ""zup,"" it also corresponds to ""red,"" except for the first example where there's nothing else to compare to.
- When ""wif"" follows ""bluf,"" the ""red"" appears in the place where ""blue"" would have appeared otherwise.

It seems like ""wif"" stands for ""red"" in each instance, except it may also alter the preceding rule for ""bluf"" from producing ""blue"" to producing ""red.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""wif"" is:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red"".
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""zup"" has a connection to the output ""yellow."" 

First example: zup, when followed by different words (dax, bluf, wif), results in yellow, green, green, red respectively. When repeated with bluf afterwards, it maintains the same color output for bluf (green) and shows zup as yellow again.

Second example: zup alone followed by lug leads to yellow, blue.

Third example: lug dax zup dax wif sequence shows ""blue green yellow green red,"" indicating that zup is yellow again in the sequence.

Fourth example: zup walm is translated to yellow three times, suggesting that zup means yellow no matter the following word in this case.

Fifth example: following the pattern, zup once again translates to yellow.

From these observations, we can deduce the rule for zup:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns:

1. ""zup bluf"" produces ""yellow yellow""
2. ""lug wif bluf"" produces ""blue red red""
3. ""dax walm wif bluf"" produces ""green green green red red""
4. ""lug walm wif bluf"" produces ""blue blue blue red red""

From these patterns, it seems that ""bluf"" does not produce a consistent color output on its own. Instead, its output is influenced by the words that come before it. The amount of repetition in the color is equal to the number of non-bluf words. Meanwhile, the color that corresponds to ""bluf"" is ""red,"" repeated twice consistently after the colors corresponding to the other words have been repeated according to the amount of non-bluf words.

Hence, ""bluf"" means red repeated twice, regardless of the context.

Rule: bluf -> red red
Based on the examples provided, we can associate the presence of the word ""walm"" with the repetition of a color in the output. The color that is repeated corresponds to the word that immediately precedes ""walm"". Here are the observations:

- In the first example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and we get two repetitions of yellow followed by three repetitions of red. ""Wif"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" seems to trigger repetition of the color tied to the previous word.
- In the second and fourth examples, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and we get three repetitions of green. ""Dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" is again triggering the repetition.
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and also ""zup"". After ""dax"" we have three greens, and after ""zup,"" we have three yellows. This further supports that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color of the preceding word.
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and we have three repetitions of blue. Therefore, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" triggers its repetition.

Rule: walm -> Triggers the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in each given example.
Based on the examples given, the rule appears to be that:

- The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red""
- The word ""bluf"" also corresponds to the color ""red""
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue""
- The word ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""green""
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow""

Since the word ""dax"" appears in every input and consistently the color ""green"" appears in the output regardless of the position or the other words present, it can be deduced that:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Each time ""wif"" is presented in the input, the output includes ""red"" at the corresponding position.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the sequence.
bluf -> blue

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue."" When used after another word, it repeats that word's color meaning. For example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"" because ""lug"" means ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it. Similarly, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"" because ""wif"" means ""red,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the subsequent word's color to be repeated three times. Here's the observed pattern:

1. ""zup walm dax lug"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow green blue,"" where ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
2. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""yellow"" is again repeated three times.
3. ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" where ""red"" is repeated three times.
4. ""dax walm lug"" results in ""green green green blue,"" where ""green"" is repeated three times.
5. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red,"" where ""yellow"" is repeated three times, ""blue"" appears once after ""lug,"" and ""red"" is repeated twice (although from this example alone, it's unclear why ""red"" is repeated only twice).

Given this pattern, the color of the word that immediately follows ""walm"" is outputted three times. The examples do not provide enough evidence on why ""red"" is repeated only twice in the last example, so we will consider that as a potential anomaly for now.

walm -> Rule: Repeat the color of the following word three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue in every given example.
After analyzing the examples provided, the following rule can be deduced:

- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- walm -> green
- lug -> blue

Given this, we can see that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" when it appears in the examples:

- Input: zup wif zup dax -> Output: yellow red yellow green
- Input: dax zup -> Output: green yellow
- Input: dax walm wif -> Output: green green green red
- Input: lug dax lug -> Output: blue green blue
- Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue

Rule: dax -> green.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we should look at each input in which it appears and the corresponding output:

1. ""dax walm wif walm"" produces ""green green green red red red."" Here ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output sequence includes one extra ""red"" than there are occurrences of ""walm.""

2. ""lug zup wif lug"" produces ""blue yellow red blue."" Here ""wif"" precedes ""lug,"" and ""red"" shows up in the output before ""blue,"" which correlates with ""lug.""

3. ""wif lug"" produces ""red blue."" ""Wif"" comes before ""lug,"" and ""red"" is the first color in the output.

4. ""wif bluf lug"" produces ""red red blue."" ""Wif"" appears before ""bluf"" and ""lug,"" and there are two ""red"" before ""blue.""

5. ""zup wif"" produces ""yellow red."" ""Wif"" follows ""zup,"" and the ""red"" appears after ""yellow"" in the output.

From these examples, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Each time ""wif"" occurs, a ""red"" appears in the output string. Additionally, ""wif"" seems to have an independent meaning and not one conditioned by what follows or precedes it.

The rule, therefore, appears to be:

wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word zup translates to the color yellow in each example given. Its presence in a sequence does not appear to change the sequence or meaning of the other words, which suggests it has a consistent translation.
From the given examples, let's deduce the meaning or rule for ""bluf"" by comparing the inputs to the outputs.

1. lug zup bluf dax -> blue yellow yellow green
2. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green
3. wif lug bluf -> red blue blue
4. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
5. lug bluf dax bluf -> blue blue green green

From the examples, we can see that:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" isn’t directly translated, but in example 2, it is surrounded by two ""dax"" which both translate to ""green"" and ""walm"" outputs ""red""

Now, looking at the examples that involve ""bluf"", we notice:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- In example 2, ""bluf"" is between ""wif"" and ""dax"" (red and green), and the output is ""red"".
- In example 3, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and results in another ""blue"" in the output.
- In example 4, ""bluf"" is paired with ""dax"" (green) and results in a ""green"" in the output.
- In example 5, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and results in ""green"" in the output but when followed by ""dax"" which translates to ""green"" the output for ""bluf"" is again ""green"".

It seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word that precedes it. However, in example 1, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" which should translate to yellow, but the color before ""bluf"" is yellow in the input, and we still get yellow in the output.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" appears to mimic the color of the word that precedes it, except if the color before ""bluf"" is ambiguous due to there not being a previously established color-word association, in which case it defaults or repeats the last known color-word association as per the given system. Since ""walm"" isn't directly translated, in example 1, the repetition of ""yellow"" suggests a fallback to the last known color which ""zup"" represents.
To interpret the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns between the input and output pairs, considering the position of ""walm"" and the corresponding colors in the output.

- First input and output pair:
  Input: wif bluf dax walm
  Output: red red green green green
  In this case, ""walm"" is at the end and is followed by three greens.

- Second input and output pair:
  Input: zup lug walm wif dax
  Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
  Here, ""walm"" is followed by three blues before changing to another word's colors (red and green).

- Third input and output pair:
  Input: wif walm dax zup
  Output: red red red green yellow
  In this example, ""walm"" again is followed by a stretch of the same color (red) before changing due to another word.

- Fourth input and output pair:
  Input: lug walm
  Output: blue blue blue
  Here, ""walm"" is immediately after another word and followed by three of the same color.

- Fifth input and output pair:
  Input: lug walm wif bluf
  Output: blue blue blue red red
  ""walm"" is in the middle of the sequence, and it precedes a repetition of the color associated with the word after it.

Analyzing these patterns, we can deduce that the word ""walm"" causes a repetition of the next word's associated color thrice. However, if ""walm"" is the last word of the input, it seems to default to repeating green.

Let's establish the rule for ""walm"" based on the given data:

Rule: ""walm"" -> When followed by another word, repeats the color associated with the next word three times. If it is the last word, it defaults to repeating green three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf lug zup walm lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow blue yellow blue blue blue,yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow blue,False,192
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the provided examples, whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output. The other words in the input correlate with different colors in the output, but the word ""lug"" consistently matches with ""blue"", suggesting that is its meaning.
dax -> green

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is the color ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that every unique word translates into a unique color. Here are the translations based on the inputs and outputs given:

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- bluf -> green
- walm -> yellow
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
Rule: zup -> yellow

Whenever the word 'zup' appears in the input, it corresponds to the color 'yellow' in the output.
From the given examples, we can try to deduce the pattern of the input and output to figure out what ""bluf"" corresponds to.

In every output sequence, the color that follows ""bluf"" is repeated from the previous color. For example:
- If ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and after ""bluf"" blue is repeated - ""blue blue"".
- If ""wif"" corresponds to red, and after ""bluf,"" red is repeated - ""red red"".
- If ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and after ""bluf,"" yellow is repeated - ""yellow yellow"".

Let's consider the contexts where ""bluf"" does not immediately follow another color word:
- Input: ""zup bluf lug dax lug"", the output is ""yellow yellow blue green blue"". Here ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and results in ""yellow yellow"", so it's causing a repeat of ""yellow"".
- Input: ""zup wif bluf"", the output is ""yellow red red"". Again, ""bluf"" causes a repetition of ""red"".

Based on the above observations, ""bluf"" seems to cause the color that immediately precedes it to be repeated in the output sequence. If there's no color word before ""bluf,"" it defaults to repeating the previous color that was mentioned.

Rule: bluf -> repeating the previous color word in the sequence. If ""bluf"" is the first word, then there is no previous word to repeat; it should then be examined in the context of further examples. However, in all cases presented, ""bluf"" has not been the first word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at each instance of ""walm"" and its corresponding outputs to establish a pattern.

- In the first example, ""lug walm zup wif"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow red."" We notice that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" Therefore, the sequence ""blue blue blue"" suggests that ""walm"" translates to ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue."" Since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" the following triple ""blue"" again suggests ""walm"" translates to ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""lug wif dax walm zup"" results in ""blue red green green green yellow."" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" The sequence ""green green green"" that follows ""dax"" and precedes ""zup"" again points to ""walm"" being ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" With ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow,"" the sequence suggests that ""walm"" means ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup wif lug zup walm"" results in ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and is followed by three ""yellow"" in the sequence, which again indicates that ""walm"" translates to ""yellow.""

Analyzing the patterns, we can infer that ""walm"" takes on the color of the previous word. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is that it mimics the color of the word that comes before it in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> Mimics the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning: blue

Rule: Every time the word ""lug"" is used in the input, it corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be:

wif -> red

Each occurrence of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sentence. This is consistent across all examples. 

Rule: wif means ""red"".
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce a rule for the nonce word 'zup'. The rule can be derived by looking at each instance where 'zup' is used and the corresponding output:

1. ""wif bluf zup bluf wif"" -> ""red red yellow yellow red""
2. ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
3. ""lug zup"" -> ""blue yellow""
4. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue""

Analyzing these inputs and outputs, 'zup' consistently corresponds to the output 'yellow'. It doesn't seem to be affected by the words around it. Therefore, we can conclude the following rule:

Rule: The nonce word 'zup' translates to the color 'yellow'.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" we need to look for patterns in the different inputs and their corresponding outputs. The word ""bluf"" occurs in each input example, and we can look at the words that come before and after it as well as their corresponding colors to try and figure out what ""bluf"" could mean.

Input 1: zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
Input 2: dax bluf -> green green
Input 3: dax bluf wif -> green green red
Input 4: dax lug wif bluf -> green blue red red
Input 5: lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red

Looking at the patterns, we can make the following observations:
- In every case, the output color immediately following the occurrence of ""bluf"" is green.
- The context or position of ""bluf"" does not seem to impact this rule, as it precedes green whether it is at the end, the middle, or in sequences of varying lengths.

Given this consistent pattern, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color green.
Based upon the given examples, ""walm"" seems to cause the following word to repeat the color associated with it until another non-""walm"" word appears. Here's the breakdown:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color red, and the output sequence is ""green green green red."" The presence of ""walm"" causes the color green to repeat until ""wif,"" which changes the color to red.

2. In the second example, ""dax"" is green, and after ""walm"" is mentioned, green is repeated until ""lug,"" which changes the color to blue.

3. In the third example, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" and we see red repeated.

4. In the fourth example, ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" and blue is repeated until ""zup,"" which changes the color to yellow. Then, ""lug"" and ""walm"" repeat the pattern again.

5. In the fifth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" and red is repeated until ""dax,"" which is green.

Rule: walm -> When ""walm"" is used, it causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to repeat until a different word (which will have its own associated color) appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,194
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following:

- Each individual word corresponds to a color in the output.
- The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"".

Given these observations, here are the apparent correlations for each word:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" does not appear with a direct output, but given the pattern, it likely corresponds to ""red"" as it appears three times and ""red"" appears three times in the output.

Rule: 
dax -> green

This rule applies regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input string.
Analyzing the examples provided, let's inspect the output associated with the appearance of ""wif"":

1. wif bluf -> red red
2. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red
3. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red
4. zup wif -> yellow red
5. zup dax wif -> yellow green red

It appears that every time ""wif"" is used, ""red"" follows. Additionally, ""wif"" seems to coax the color associated with the immediately preceding word (if there is one) to repeat in the output. Let's break it down:

- ""bluf"" corresponds with ""red.""
- ""walm"" corresponds with ""red.""
- ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow,"" and when ""wif"" follows ""zup,"" ""red"" also follows (""yellow red"").
- ""dax"" corresponds with ""green,"" and when ""wif"" follows ""dax,"" ""red"" also follows (""green red"").

Given these observations, it seems that ""wif"" prompts the color corresponding to the preceding word (if any) to appear once followed by ""red."" If ""wif"" is the first word in the sequence, then only ""red"" appears.

Rule: wif -> duplicates the color associated with the immediately preceding word followed by ""red."" If no word precedes it, ""wif"" produces ""red.""
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" correlates with the output of the word ""yellow."" The number of times ""yellow"" is output seems to depend on the number of words following ""zup."" Here's the pattern I deduce:

- When ""zup"" is by itself, the output is a single ""yellow.""
- When ""zup"" is followed by one word (e.g., ""walm"" or ""bluf""), the output is two repetitions of ""yellow.""
- When ""zup"" is followed by two words (e.g., ""dax zup bluf""), the output includes ""yellow"" repeated twice preceded by another color related to the first word ""dax,"" which in this case is ""green.""

The rule I induce from this pattern is:
zup -> for each word following ""zup,"" output an additional ""yellow."" If ""zup"" is not the first word, output a color corresponding to the word before ""zup"" followed by the appropriate number of ""yellows.""

Rule:
- ""zup"" by itself results in ""yellow.""
- ""zup"" followed by one word results in ""yellow yellow.""
- Another word followed by ""zup"" and any number of words results in the color corresponding to the first word plus the number of ""yellow"" outputs equal to the number of words following ""zup.""
Rule: The word ""bluf"" results in repeating the color associated with the word that precedes it. For example, ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" so ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow."" Similarly, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue.""

Therefore: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the previous word.
From the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" affects the output by repeating the color associated with the word immediately before it. It does not have its own color, but rather generates additional instances of the color that precedes it. 

For instance, in the first example, ""wif walm dax zup,"" the word ""wif"" correlates to the color ""red,"" after which ""walm"" is used, and the output is ""red red,"" indicating that ""walm"" caused a repetition of ""red.""

Similarly, in the second example, ""zup walm wif,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" followed by ""walm,"" which results in ""yellow yellow,"" demonstrating the repeating effect of ""walm.""

Examining all examples, we can confirm this pattern:

- ""wif walm dax zup"" shows ""red red red green yellow,"" with ""walm"" repeating the color of ""wif"" (red).
- ""zup walm wif"" shows ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" with ""walm"" repeating the color of ""zup"" (yellow).
- ""dax zup walm wif walm"" shows ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red,"" where ""walm"" first repeats the color of ""zup"" (yellow) and then the color of ""wif"" (red).
- ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" shows ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""walm"" first repeats the color of ""wif"" (red), and then the color of ""zup"" (yellow).
- ""dax wif walm"" shows ""green red red red,"" where ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif"" (red).

Given the above, we can define ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:

Based on the examples, each time the word ""lug"" is used in the input, the output consistently includes the color ""blue"". Therefore, the rule is that ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"".
Based on the input-output examples provided, we can induce the following rules:

- ""dax"" always results in ""green""
- ""lug"" always results in ""blue""
- ""wif"" always results in ""red""
- ""zup"" always results in ""yellow""
- ""walm"" always results in ""green""
- ""bluf"" always results in ""green""

These rules hold true for all the given examples. Therefore, we can deduce that:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red"" every time it is used. It appears consistently at the beginning of every output sequence, indicating a direct association. There are no examples suggesting that ""wif"" modifies or interacts with adjacent words to alter its associated color. The examples show that other words, such as ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug,"" correspond to different colors (""green,"" ""yellow,"" and ""blue"" respectively). Given the evidence, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" is straightforward:

Rule: wif -> red. The meaning of ""wif"" is the color ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the output contains the color ""yellow.""

Therefore, the meaning is as follows:
zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the color patterns in the output related to the appearance of ""bluf"" in the input:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif walm lug,"" the output is ""red red red blue blue."" The pattern for ""wif,"" ""walm,"" and ""lug"" seems to be ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green."" Since the only other instance of ""dax"" shows it followed by ""green,"" we might infer that ""bluf"" also means ""green"" in this context.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup lug zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" In every other context, ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow,"" so it seems that here, ""bluf"" translates to ""blue.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif zup dax,"" the output is ""red yellow green green."" However, given the previous examples, it's clear that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" which would suggest ""bluf"" also means ""green"" here.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax zup,"" the output is ""green yellow yellow."" This is consistent with the idea that ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

From this analysis, it seems that ""bluf"" could mean either ""blue"" or ""green,"" depending on its position in the sequence. However, the common thread is that ""bluf"" is associated with a color, and when it is the only word after another color word, it repeats that color. So ""bluf"" may mean to repeat the color of the preceding word. But without more examples, particularly of ""bluf"" in isolation or in different contexts, this conclusion is speculative.

Based on the given examples alone and without further context or additional data points, a safe inference rule is:

Rule: ""bluf"" means ""repeat the color of the preceding word,"" except when following ""lug,"" where ""bluf"" means ""blue.""
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should examine the output colors corresponding to its use in the input sentences. We observe that ""walm"" always results in a sequence of red in the output, except in the sequence with ""dax"" or ""zup"" preceding or following it.

- In the first example, ""dax walm wif"" leads to ""green green green red,"" so ""walm"" seems to change the sequence to red except when ""dax"" precedes it, which results in green. 
- In the second example, ""zup wif walm lug,"" we have ""yellow red red red blue"" indicating that ""walm"" has once again predominantly caused the output to be red, except for ""lug,"" which results in blue.
- In the third example, ""wif walm dax"" gives us ""red red red green,"" showing that ""dax"" at the end of the sequence turns green, regardless of ""walm"" being in the middle.
- In the fourth example, ""dax wif walm lug zup,"" the output is ""green red red red blue yellow."" Here, ""dax"" in the beginning results in green, ""lug"" following ""walm"" results in blue, and ""zup"" at the end produces yellow, further confirming their influence.
- In the fifth example, ""lug wif walm"" results in ""blue red red red,"" indicating again that ""lug"" results in blue and ""walm"" initiates a sequence of reds.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" results in the output turning to red except when specific conditions involving ""dax,"" ""zup,"" or ""lug"" are met (where ""dax"" results in green, ""zup"" in yellow, and ""lug"" in blue either before or after ""walm"").

Rule: walm -> causes the output color to change to red, unless directly preceded by ""dax"" or followed by ""lug"" which result in green and blue respectively, and unless it is at the end of the sequence before ""zup"" which results in yellow.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
From the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green."" Regardless of the surrounding words (""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""zup,"" or ""bluf""), any instance of ""dax"" produces ""green"" in the output.

Based on the examples given:

- ""dax"" alone results in ""green.""
- ""dax"" coupled with another instance of ""dax"" gives ""green"" for each ""dax.""
- ""dax"" alongside other nonce words such as ""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""zup,"" or ""bluf"" still yields ""green"" for ""dax"" and some consistent colors for these other nonce words as they repeat their pattern as well. For example, ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

The rule deduced is that the word ""dax"" maps to the color ""green"" regardless of its position or the context in the sequence of words. So, here is the interpretation based on the given examples:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Regardless of its position in the input sequence (beginning, end, or standalone), ""wif"" consistently leads to the output of ""red."" Other words following or preceding ""wif"" result in additional colors: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""zup"" corresponds with the color yellow. Each time ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, the color yellow appears in the same position in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Analyzing the given examples and observing the patterns:

1. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""
2. ""lug zup bluf dax"" -> ""blue yellow yellow green""
3. ""lug wif lug bluf"" -> ""blue red blue blue""
4. ""wif bluf lug zup"" -> ""red red blue yellow""
5. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""

Comparing the inputs and outputs side by side:

- Each instance of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- Each ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""dax"" turns into ""green"" when following ""bluf"" and into ""blue"" otherwise.
- ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow"".
- ""bluf"" is always followed by ""red"" when it comes before other words, regardless of what the other words are.

Given the consistency of ""bluf"" being followed by ""red"", it's apparent that ""bluf"" translates to ""red"":

Rule: bluf -> red
Upon reviewing the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" correlates with repeating the color that corresponds to the immediately preceding word. Specifically, the output color repeats as many times as syllables contained in the word ""walm"". Since ""walm"" has one syllable, the previous color is repeated once.

Here's the breakdown against the inputs and outputs to support this rule:

1. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red
Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"", which translates to ""red"". We see ""red"" repeated once after ""walm"".

2. lug walm -> blue blue blue
Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which translates to ""blue"". We see ""blue"" repeated three times after ""walm"", but since the rule is about one repetition per occurrence of ""walm"" and only one instance of ""walm"" exists, the colors could have been set out for another reason. We'll need other examples to isolate the rule for one ""walm"" appearance.

3. zup lug walm wif dax -> yellow blue blue blue red green
Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which translates to ""blue"". ""Blue"" is repeated three times, but similarly to example 2, this can be clarified with more information.

4. dax lug wif walm -> green blue red red red
Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"". ""Red"" is repeated once after ""walm"".

5. zup bluf lug zup walm -> yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which translates to ""yellow"". ""Yellow"" is repeated once after ""walm"".

Given the consistent pattern in examples 1, 4, and 5 in terms of the previous color repeating once after ""walm"", it supports the rule. However, since examples 2 and 3 show more repetitions without additional explanations, it could be possible ""walm"" has another rule involved that pertains to its position in the sequence, or related to the words around it which hasn't been isolated. But based on the information provided, the simplest rule that fits all the examples is as follows:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows another word, the color associated with the preceding word is repeated once in the output. If ""walm"" is repeated in the input, this could influence additional repetitions of the color in the output. 

Hence,
walm -> meaning: Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" once.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax bluf wif lug
    ",Output: blue green red red blue blue,blue green green red blue,False,197
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Regardless of its position in the input sequence, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's analyze how the word correlates to the output in different contexts:

1. ""zup wif zup dax"" -> ""yellow red yellow green""
   ""dax"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""green"".

2. ""dax bluf wif"" -> ""green green red""
   ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"" and the preceding output is ""green"".

3. ""dax"" -> ""green""
   ""dax"" on its own corresponds to ""green"".

4. ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow blue yellow yellow""
   ""dax"" is followed by different words and its corresponding output remains ""green"".

5. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow orange green red red""
   Despite ""dax"" being preceded by different words, its corresponding output is ""green"".

Looking at the patterns, we can discern that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words that precede or follow it.

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". Therefore, dax -> green.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's initially examine each of the provided examples to observe if there's a pattern with the word ""wif"" and the colors in the output:

1. dax walm wif dax -> green green green red green
The color before ""wif"" is green, and the output color for ""wif"" is red, showing a change in the pattern that occurs with the introduction of ""wif.""

2. wif bluf dax lug -> red red green blue
Here ""wif"" is the first word and is associated with red. The next words are unrelated to the word ""wif"" and have their own colors.

3. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
The word before ""wif"" is ""zup,"" which is yellow, and ""wif"" is associated with red. Again, it's associated with a change from the previous color.

4. wif -> red
Here ""wif"" stands alone and is still associated with red.

5. lug walm zup lug zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
Every time we see ""wif,"" it is associated with red, regardless of the position or the words that precede it.

Reviewing all occurrences, the common rule seems to be that ""wif"" is always associated with the color red, independent of its position or neighboring words. Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" is tied to this consistent color output.

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Each occurrence of the word ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the repetition of the color word that precedes it. In all cases, the color word that appears just before ""bluf"" is repeated in the output. Here's the breakdown:

1. ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" and the output is ""red red"".
2. ""lug"" is followed by ""bluf"" and the output is ""blue blue"".
3. ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"", and then ""lug"", and the output is ""red red blue"".
4. ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"" and the output is ""yellow yellow"".
5. Again, ""zup"" followed by ""bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"".

Thus, it seems that ""bluf"" functions as a repeater for the color word that immediately precedes it. 

Rule: bluf -> Repetition of the preceding color word.
walm -> meaning. Rule:

Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" appears to mean ""repeat the color of the previous word three times."" Here's how this rule applies to each example:

- In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, so ""walm"" results in ""green green green.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and after ""lug walm,"" which follows the rule of repeating blue three times, ""dax"" leads to ""walm"" being ""green green green.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" is the word right before ""walm,"" and it corresponds to green, so ""walm"" translates to ""green green green.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" comes right before ""walm"" and represents red, so ""walm"" results in ""red red red.""

Therefore, ""walm"" seems to signal a repetition of the last color mentioned, three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,198
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" irrespective of its position in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" is associated with the color green consistently. Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green"" in the corresponding position. Here is the rule induction based on the examples:

- ""dax wif bluf"" -> ""green red red""
- ""dax walm wif dax"" -> ""green green green red green""
- ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue""
- ""lug dax walm wif"" -> ""blue green green green red""
- ""dax"" -> ""green""

Rule: dax -> green. Whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, the output is ""green"" in the corresponding position.
From the examples provided, it seems that each word is associated with a color. Let's attempt to deduce the rule for what ""wif"" means by examining its association in each input-output pair:

1. Input: wif lug - Output: red blue
   - This indicates that ""wif"" translates to ""red"".

2. Input: zup lug walm wif walm - Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   - The word ""lug"" is consistently associated with ""blue"" as seen in other examples. ""Wif"" follows ""walm"" and precedes the sequence ""red red red"", which indicates ""wif"" could still mean ""red"" in this context.

3. Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif - Output: red red yellow yellow red
   - ""Zup"" appears to be associated with ""yellow"" as seen in other examples. ""Wif"" appears at the beginning and end of the sequence, both times translating to ""red"".

4. Input: wif - Output: red
   - ""Wif"" on its own gives the output ""red"", which supports our hypothesis.

5. Input: dax wif lug dax - Output: green red blue green
   - The word ""lug"" is again associated with ""blue"", and ""dax"" with ""green"". ""Wif"" is associated with ""red"" here as well.

Based on the examples, the rule seems consistent:

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" consistently, regardless of its position or the other words around it. Each instance of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" changes to match the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. There is not enough information to definitively determine the exact meanings of ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and ""wif,"" but it can be inferred that each of these words corresponds to a color since the outputs are color names. Here's the breakdown based on the given examples:

- In ""zup bluf,"" ""bluf"" takes the color associated with ""zup,"" because the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- In ""lug dax bluf,"" ""bluf"" takes the color associated with ""dax,"" because the output is ""blue green green.""
- In ""wif bluf dax,"" ""bluf"" takes the color associated with ""wif,"" because the output is ""red red green.""
- In ""wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" takes the color associated with ""wif,"" because the output is ""red red.""
- In ""wif bluf lug,"" ""bluf"" takes the color associated with ""wif,"" because the output is ""red red blue.""

Following this pattern, ""bluf"" seems to replicate the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.
walm -> repeater. Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times. For example:
- ""lug wif walm"" means ""blue red"" becomes ""blue red red red"" because ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and is repeated three times after ""walm"".
- ""lug walm"" means ""blue"" is repeated three times to become ""blue blue blue"".
- ""lug dax walm"" means ""blue green"" becomes ""blue green green green"".
- ""dax walm"" means ""green"" is repeated three times to become ""green green green"".
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" includes ""walm"" after ""lug"", which translates to ""blue,"" so it becomes ""blue blue blue"" at that point, and the sequence continues normally with ""dax lug"" resulting in ""green blue"".

Note: The repetition only applies to the color word immediately before ""walm"" and no other words are affected by the presence of ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
