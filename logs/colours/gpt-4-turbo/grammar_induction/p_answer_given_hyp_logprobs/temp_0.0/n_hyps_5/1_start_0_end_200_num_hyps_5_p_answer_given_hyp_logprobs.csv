    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in every example provided.
Based on the given input-output pairs, we can observe a pattern in the assignment of colors to different words, including the nonce word ""dax"". Here is how the pattern seems to apply:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green"".
- The word ""walm"" when it follows ""dax"" or another ""walm"", it also results in ""green"".
- The word ""walm"" when it precedes ""dax"" or is at the start, results in ""red"".
- The word ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow"".
- The word ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red"".

With these observations, we can deduce the following rule for ""dax"":

Rule: ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the patterns of inputs and their corresponding outputs. The repetition in examples 3 and 4 confirms the consistency of the translation for ""lug"" and ""bluf"" as ""blue"" and ""red"" respectively. Now, let's look at the position where ""wif"" occurs and the output colors that correspond.

In example 1, ""wif"" comes before ""bluf"" and the output is ""red red"" after the ""yellow"" which corresponds to ""bluf.""
In example 2, ""wif"" comes before ""walm"" and the output is ""red red"" followed by ""yellow yellow yellow"" for ""walm.""
In example 3, ""wif"" comes after ""lug"" and we again see ""red red"" following the ""blue"" of ""lug.""
In example 5, ""wif"" comes before ""lug"" and we see ""red"" followed by ""blue blue blue"" for ""lug walm.""

From these patterns, it seems that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and also causes the following color word to be repeated once. 

Rule: wif -> red, causing the next color to be repeated once.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

- Whenever the input is ""zup"" on its own, the output is ""yellow"".
- In the input ""lug walm zup wif,"" if we assume ""lug"" corresponds to the first ""blue,"" ""walm"" to the second ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" then ""zup"" would match with the ""yellow"" in the output, consistent with previous examples.
- In the input ""lug zup,"" if we take ""lug"" to correspond to ""blue"" as before, ""zup"" again corresponds to ""yellow"".

Since ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present, we can rule that the meaning is not dependent on context in the given data.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that is represented by the word that immediately precedes it. For each input example, the output gives a sequence of colors. The color that appears right after ""bluf"" is always the same as the color corresponding to the word before ""bluf"". Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.

Let's verify this rule with the provided examples:

1. dax bluf wif lug zup
   - dax corresponds to green, bluf takes the color of dax, which is green.
   - The sequence continues normally for wif, lug, and zup.

2. zup bluf
   - zup corresponds to yellow, bluf takes the color of zup, which is yellow.

3. lug dax bluf
   - dax corresponds to green, bluf takes the color of dax, which is green.

4. dax bluf wif lug
   - dax corresponds to green, bluf takes the color of dax, which is green.

5. lug bluf
   - lug corresponds to blue, bluf takes the color of lug, which is blue.

According to these examples, the rule holds true.
walm -> repeated thrice; the color that is repeated is determined by the word preceding ""walm"". Rule: 

- ""dax"" before ""walm"" results in ""green"" being repeated thrice. 
- ""lug"" before ""walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated thrice.
- ""zup"" before ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" being repeated thrice.

Additionally, the presence of ""wif"" after ""walm"" adds a singular ""red"" following the color repetition.

So, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the previous color word to repeat thrice. If the sequence is followed by ""wif,"" a ""red"" is added.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax
    ",Output: red green,red green,True,0
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""dax"" consistently translates to the output ""green"", regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence or the other words around it. Here's how ""dax"" correlates to the output across all examples:

Input: dax
Output: green
Rule: When ""dax"" is the only word in the input, the output is ""green"".

Input: wif bluf dax lug
Output: red red green blue
Rule: When ""dax"" follows other words (""wif"" and ""bluf""), it still gives the output ""green"".

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow
Rule: When ""dax"" is the first word followed by other words, the output is still ""green"" for ""dax"".

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
Rule: When ""dax"" precedes another word (""bluf""), the output remains ""green"" for ""dax"".

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
Rule: Even when ""dax"" is in the middle of the sequence, it translates to ""green"".

From these examples, we can deduce that the presence of the word ""dax"" directly leads to the output ""green"" independent of its position or surrounding words. The other words in the inputs seem to have their own consistent outputs—like ""wif"" relating to ""red,"" ""bluf"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow""—but these are outside what we are asked to focus on.

Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" appears to be simply:

dax -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: ""dax"" consistently means ""green"" regardless of context in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to look for patterns in the examples provided.

1. Input: wif lug dax | Output: red blue green
   The word ""wif"" precedes ""lug"" which translates to blue, and ""dax"" which translates to green.

2. Input: wif zup lug zup lug | Output: red yellow blue yellow blue
   Again, ""wif"" is followed by a color sequence starting with ""red."" The colors that follow ""red"" are independent of ""wif"" (yellow and blue corresponding to ""zup"" and ""lug"").

3. Input: dax wif walm lug zup | Output: green red red red blue yellow
   Here we have ""wif"" preceded by ""dax"" (green) and followed by ""walm lug"" which results in two reds. It seems ""walm"" does not have a direct color translation, but ""lug"" corresponds to blue, which has been translated differently here.

4. Input: lug dax wif lug | Output: blue green red blue
   ""Wif"" is sandwiched between ""dax"" (green) and ""lug"" (blue), but whenever ""wif"" appears, ""red"" is in the output.

5. Input: wif zup wif dax | Output: red yellow red green
   In this case, ""wif"" appears twice, and both times it is directly followed by ""red"" in the output.

From these examples, we can observe that each appearance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output sequence, regardless of the words that follow or precede it. Where ""wif"" alone does not have nearby corresponding colors, it aligns with ""red"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> ""red""
Rule: zup -> yellow (repeated for as many syllables as the following word has).

Explanation:
- zup walm: ""yellow yellow yellow"" (since 'walm' has one syllable, ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow"" repeated once.)
- zup lug: ""yellow blue"" (since 'lug' has one syllable, ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow"" repeated once; the second word 'lug' translates to ""blue"".)
- wif walm zup walm: ""red red red yellow yellow yellow"" (The word ""wif"" seems unrelated to ""zup"" and translates to ""red red red""; 'walm' follows which maintains its translation from the first example; then ""zup"" translation follows the pattern based on the syllable count of 'walm' which is one, hence ""yellow"" is repeated three times.)
- zup bluf: ""yellow yellow"" ('bluf' has one syllable, so ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" repeated once.)
- lug zup: ""blue yellow"" (first word 'lug' translates to ""blue""; ""zup"" follows and appears to be affected by the previous word's number of syllables which is one, hence a single ""yellow"".)

Given all the examples, it appears that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", and the number of times ""yellow"" is repeated corresponds to the number of syllables in the word that follows or precedes ""zup"". It should be noted that this is a hypothetical rule based solely on the given examples, and as such may not hold in cases outside these particular instances.
Observing the given examples:

- `lug walm wif lug bluf` -> `blue blue blue red blue blue`
- `zup wif bluf` -> `yellow red red`
- `wif bluf` -> `red red`
- `dax lug wif bluf` -> `green blue red red`
- `lug bluf wif` -> `blue blue red`

One can notice that ""bluf"" corresponds to a color output in each case. ""Wif"" seems to always correspond to ""red"", and based on the repeated patterns, it is reasonable to hypothesize that ""bluf"" produces ""red"" but under certain conditions it might be influenced by preceding words.

However, since ""bluf"" alone does not appear in any of the examples, it's not possible to determine its individual output. It's also worth noting that ""bluf"" does not strictly follow ""wif"" to produce ""red"" in the output. This is evident in that the first example does not have two ""red"" outputs in a row, even though ""bluf"" follows ""wif"".

By the given examples, we can create a hypothesis:

Rule: When ""bluf"" is immediately preceded by ""wif"", the output is ""red"". In all other cases, the meaning of ""bluf"" is not clearly deducible from the given examples.

Formulated as instructed:

bluf -> meaning. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output associated with ""bluf"" is ""red"". Further information or examples are needed to determine the meaning of ""bluf"" in other contexts.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the outputs concerning the point at which ""walm"" appears in the sequence:

1. Input: wif **walm** dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red **red** green yellow red blue blue blue

2. Input: dax wif **walm**
   Output: green red **red** red

3. Input: dax lug **walm**
   Output: green blue **blue** blue

4. Input: dax wif **walm**
   Output: green red **red** red

5. Input: lug **walm** zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue **blue** yellow blue yellow red

Looking at the instances where ""walm"" is used in the sequence, it appears that the color after ""walm"" (which is the response to ""walm"") is a repeat of the color assigned to the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

- In example 1, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output color is red for both.
- In example 2 and 4, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output color is red immediately after ""walm.""
- In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output color is blue immediately after ""walm.""
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output color is blue immediately after ""walm.""

So, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the output color of the word that comes right before it. Thus:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color output of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup
    ",Output: red yellow,red yellow,True,1
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.
From the provided examples, one can infer the following about the output:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, the color ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
- The presence of other words like ""lug"", ""walm"", ""zup"", ""wif"" results in other colors such as ""blue"", ""yellow"", and ""red"" appearing in the output.
- Regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence, ""green"" is always the output for that word.

Therefore, based on the examples, the rule seems to be:

dax -> green

Rule: ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position or the presence of other words in the input.
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif."" We can observe what changes when ""wif"" is present in various positions and contexts.

- When ""wif"" appears alone, the output is ""red.""
- When ""wif"" appears with ""lug,"" the output adds ""blue"" after ""red.""
- The position of ""wif"" in the third input, ""lug wif walm,"" results in ""blue red red red,"" showing that ""wif"" generates ""red"" and may also affect the repetition of ""red.""
- Finally, when ""wif"" is the last word following ""zup"" and ""lug,"" the output is ""yellow blue red,"" suggesting ""wif"" retains its association with ""red.""

Given that ""wif"" consistently results in ""red"" regardless of its position, the rule we can deduce is as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word corresponds to one or more color outputs. To deduce the meaning of zup, let's examine the output colors each time zup is used:

1. wif walm zup lug zup walm -> red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   ""wif"" corresponds to a single red, ""walm"" corresponds to either two or three reds, and ""lug"" corresponds to yellow. It is not entirely clear why ""walm"" corresponds to different numbers of reds, but importantly, after ""zup"" is said, ""lug"" corresponds to blue instead of yellow. When ""zup"" appears again, the ""walm"" that follows does not have the same color pattern as before.

2. zup bluf lug dax lug -> yellow yellow blue green blue
   ""bluf"" corresponds to blue, ""dax"" to green, and ""lug"" to blue when it appears after ""dax"". However, ""lug"" appears as blue, not yellow after ""zup,"" indicating a pattern change.

3. dax wif zup -> green red yellow
   ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""wif"" to red, and ""zup"" to yellow (without any word following it to potentially change).

4. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
   ""wif"" corresponds to red, and once again, ""zup"" is followed by ""wif"" and outputs yellow.

5. wif zup -> red yellow
   ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""zup"" to yellow.

Looking at the instances where ""zup"" appears, it seems to affect the color output directly following it, except when it's the last word or only followed by ""wif"". It also appears that ""zup"" itself corresponds to yellow unless it follows another word, in which case, it affects the pattern for the words that follow it.

Summary Rule: The word ""zup"" on its own translates to yellow. When preceding another word (except for ""wif""), ""zup"" changes the expected color output of that word. 

Rule:
zup -> yellow (when it is at the end of a phrase or followed by ""wif"")
zup -> changes the following word's color output (when followed by a word other than ""wif"")
Analyzing the given input-output pairs, we can attempt to determine the meaning of ""bluf"" based on the corresponding outputs:

1. *Input:* zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug  
   *Output:* yellow green green red yellow yellow blue  
   The word ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""yellow"".

2. *Input:* lug dax bluf zup lug wif  
   *Output:* blue green green yellow blue red  
   The word ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"".

3. *Input:* zup bluf  
   *Output:* yellow yellow  
   The word ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

4. *Input:* wif walm lug bluf  
   *Output:* red red red blue blue  
   The word ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"".

5. *Input:* zup bluf  
   *Output:* yellow yellow  
   The word ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

Looking at the commonalities and discrepancies, ""bluf"" seems to correspond to a color that is repeated. Specifically, ""bluf"" seems not to have its own color, but instead takes on the color of the word that precedes it:
- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which is ""green"" and then later ""zup"" which is ""yellow.""
- In the third and fifth examples, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which is ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" also represents ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, though ""bluf"" is at the end, if we apply the rule of taking the previous word's color, it takes ""lug"" which is ""red,"" yet the output is ""blue blue."" It seems for the color ""red,"" the rule changes and ""bluf"" becomes ""blue blue.""

Let's adjust the rule taking into account example 4 where ""bluf"" is different. The possible rule could be:

When ""bluf"" follows a regular word, it takes that word's color, but when it follows ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""red"" and is the only instance of this exception in the provided examples), it becomes ""blue blue.""

Here is a revised rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Takes the color of the word before it, but if that word is ""lug"" (red), then ""bluf"" becomes ""blue blue"".
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in each example.

1. In the first example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" maps to ""blue blue blue red blue blue."" We can notice that the words ""lug"" and ""bluf"" correspond to the color ""blue,"" while ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" Since ""walm"" is surrounded by ""lug,"" and the output is three repetitions of ""blue,"" it suggests that ""walm"" could mean a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it.

2. In the second example, ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" translates to ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow."" Again, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the output is three ""red"" in a row. The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" This supports the idea that ""walm"" means repeating the color linked with the preceding word.

3. ""Dax walm"" translates to ""green green green."" Here, ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and it's followed by a repetition of the color ""green"" three times. This is consistent with the previous examples.

4. ""Wif walm"" leads to ""red red red."" This also matches the pattern where ""walm"" causes the preceding word's color to be repeated.

5. Lastly, ""dax zup dax walm"" yields ""green yellow green green green."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" After a second ""dax,"" we see ""green"" repeated three times due to ""walm.""

Rule: ""walm"" -> Triggers the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"", we need to look at the patterns within the given examples. Each instance of example inputs and outputs will be analyzed to infer the rule.

Input: dax wif dax
Output: green red green
- It appears that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and the presence of ""wif"" introduces ""red"" between the two occurrences of ""green"".

Input: wif dax
Output: red green
- ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green"", and ""wif"" appears to be ""red,"" as it precedes ""green.""

Input: wif
Output: red
- Without any other words to influence the output, ""wif"" by itself yields ""red.""

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" while ""wif"" is followed by three occurrences of ""red,"" which may suggest that ""wif"" induces a ""red"" output, but the rule is ambiguous here since ""walm"" alone does not appear in any examples. It is unknown if ""walm"" affects the output. However, because ""wif"" is associated with red in every output, it is consistent to consider ""wif"" as ""red.""

Input: wif
Output: red
- Once again, ""wif"" by itself is associated with ""red.""

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, ""zup"" appears to have a consistent output regardless of its position in the input sequence. ""Zup"" always translates to ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule:
zup -> yellow
Reviewing the provided examples where ""bluf"" is used, we observe that the output seems to depend on both the presence and the position of ""bluf"" among other words:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output is ""red red"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" or ""zup"", the output contains a doubled color of the word that comes before ""bluf"".
- ""bluf"" following ""wif"" results in ""red red"", irrespective of what comes after. However, following ""dax"" or ""zup"" results in a repetition of ""green"" or ""yellow"" respectively.

Given this observation, it appears that ""bluf"" represents a rule that says to repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word:
- ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.

So, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be: repeat the color output of the word that immediately precedes ""bluf"".

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color represented by the preceding word.
walm -> meaning. The word ""walm"" means ""repeat the color of the previous word three times.""

Rule: Whenever the word ""walm"" appears in the input, it causes the color represented by the previous word to be repeated three times in the output. For example, if ""zag"" corresponds to ""red,"" then ""zag walm"" would yield ""red red red."" In the provided examples, ""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" and so forth. ""Walm"" always follows a color word and outputs the corresponding color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax bluf
    ",Output: red green green,red green green,True,3
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""lug"" translates to a color each time it is used. To deduce the specific meaning, let's examine the position of ""lug"" relative to other words and their corresponding colors.

1. ""lug dax"" -> ""blue green""
2. ""zup dax lug dax"" -> ""yellow green blue green""
3. ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" -> ""green blue yellow red red green""
4. ""lug dax wif"" -> ""blue green red""
5. ""zup wif lug wif"" -> ""yellow red blue red""

In instances where ""lug"" appears, the following color output is consistently ""blue."" This can be observed in examples 1, 2, and 4, where ""lug"" is followed by ""dax,"" resulting in the sequence ""blue green."" In example 3, ""lug"" appears between ""dax"" and ""zup,"" corresponding to ""green blue yellow,"" indicating that ""lug"" is still related to the color ""blue."" Example 5 pairs ""lug"" with ""wif"" yielding ""blue red"" after ""lug wif,"" maintaining the consistency of ""lug"" representing ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
From the examples provided, dax seems to be associated with the color green. We can determine this by examining instances where dax is used:

1. zup wif dax walm lug -> yellow red green green green blue
   Here, dax is followed by two repeated colors (green) which might imply dax translates to green.

2. lug wif dax bluf wif lug -> blue red green green red blue
   In this example, dax is followed by green again, supporting the initial observation.

3. zup dax lug zup -> yellow green blue yellow
   Once more, dax is followed by green.

4. dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue blue yellow red
   The sequence starts with dax which is translated to green.

5. zup dax lug -> yellow green blue
   Again, dax translates to green.

Based on the examples, each positional usage of dax correlates with the color green.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that each English word corresponds to a color:

- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" (as seen in example 3, ""walm"" repeated three times corresponds to ""red"" repeated three times).
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Looking at the instances where ""wif"" appears and the corresponding output colors, we can see that ""wif"" is always translated into ""red."" So, regardless of its position in the sequence of words, ""wif"" is consistently resulting in the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be that it outputs a color which matches the color associated with the word that comes before it. Each unique word appears to correspond with a unique color as follows: 

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue  

Therefore, when ""bluf"" follows any of these words, it outputs the color corresponding to the preceding word. Here are the derived rules exemplified with each input:

- ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red"" because ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to red.
- ""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax"" outputs ""red blue blue yellow yellow green"" because ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and ""zup"" (yellow) respectively.
- ""zup bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow"" because ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow.
- ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" outputs ""yellow yellow red green red yellow"" because we have ""bluf"" following ""zup"" (yellow), and the sequence repeats with other color-associated words.
- ""zup dax bluf"" outputs ""yellow green green"" because ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to green.

Rule: bluf -> outputs the color corresponding to the preceding word.
From the provided examples, we can infer the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" by analyzing the output and the context where ""walm"" appears:

- In the first example, ""wif dax zup walm,"" the output is ""red green yellow yellow yellow."" Noting that ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" it appears that ""walm"" causes the following color word to repeat the color of the word immediately before it, which here is ""yellow."" 

- In the second example, ""dax walm lug,"" the output is ""green green green blue."" ""Dax"" has been established as ""green,"" and ""walm"" following it causes the next color to also be ""green,"" which supports the initial observation.

- In the third example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue blue red blue blue."" The ""lug"" before ""walm"" is ""blue,"" and again ""walm"" induces a repetition of the ""blue"" color. 

- The fourth example, ""lug walm,"" outputting ""blue blue blue,"" is consistent with the above rule – ""lug"" (blue) is followed by repetition of ""blue"" with ""walm.""

- The fifth example, ""dax walm,"" also repeats the color ""green,"" following the established rule for ""walm"" after ""dax"" (green).

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" causes the next word to take on the color of the word immediately before ""walm,"" resulting in a repetition of that color.

Based on the examples provided, the rule for ""zup"" seems to be as follows:

zup -> ""yellow"" 

This is consistent across all examples when ""zup"" is translated into ""yellow"":

- lug zup -> blue yellow
- wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
- zup dax lug -> yellow green blue
- zup dax wif -> yellow green red
- zup dax walm zup wif -> yellow green green green yellow red

Rule: When ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow"".
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look at the patterns of input and output pairs.

Looking at the examples:

1. ""wif bluf dax lug"" maps to ""red red green blue""
2. ""zup bluf lug"" maps to ""yellow yellow blue""
3. ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" maps to ""yellow yellow red green red yellow""
4. ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" maps to ""green green red yellow blue""
5. ""dax bluf"" maps to ""green green""

The word immediately following ""bluf"" in the output is always a color. 
In examples 1 and 4, the color following ""bluf"" is the same as the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" (for ""wif"" red and for ""dax"" green). This pattern is again seen in examples 2, 3, and 5, where ""bluf"" precedes the final color that is the same as the one matching the word before ""bluf.""

Based on the above observations, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it repeats the color that corresponds to the word right before it. 

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color corresponding to the previous word.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to be related to the repetition of the color word that would correspond to the word that precedes ""walm.""

Looking closely:

- In the first input, ""dax walm"" produces ""green green green."" Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and the presence of ""walm"" results in ""green"" being repeated three times.

- In the second input, ""lug walm zup"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The presence of ""walm"" after ""lug"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times.

- In the third input, ""dax zup walm wif walm"" turns into ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" ""Walm"" appears after ""zup"" and ""wif,"" causing ""yellow"" and ""red"" to be repeated three times each.

- In the fourth input, ""zup walm lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the presence of ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" being repeated three times.

- In the fifth input, ""dax walm zup walm"" results in ""green green green yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""walm"" follows both ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" causing each color to be repeated three times.

From these observations, it can be concluded that ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup dax zup
    ",Output: green yellow green yellow,green yellow green yellow,True,5
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output. Each appearance of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position or the surrounding words.

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the outputs.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""wif"" is used each time there is a change in the color pattern. Here is the analysis for each example:

1) zup bluf wif dax lug corresponds to yellow yellow red green blue
   - ""zup"" is yellow twice, followed by ""bluf"" which is a new word and introduced by ""wif"" indicating a change to red. 
   - Then ""dax"" is green, and ""lug"" is blue.
   
2) dax walm wif walm zup corresponds to green green green red red red yellow
   - ""dax"" is green twice, then ""wif"" indicates a change, ""walm"" turns to red repeated three times, finishing with ""zup"" which is yellow.
   
3) wif lug corresponds to red blue
   - Starting with ""wif"" leads to red and is then followed by ""lug"" which is blue.
   
4) zup walm lug wif corresponds to yellow yellow yellow blue red
   - ""zup"" is repeated as yellow three times, followed by ""walm"" which is blue, then ""lug"" appears and ""wif"" indicates a change to a new color, red.
   
5) wif walm dax zup wif lug walm corresponds to red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   - The sequence starts with ""wif"" leading to red three times, followed by ""dax"" which changes the pattern to green, and ""zup"" to yellow. 
   - Another ""wif"" appears introducing a change to red before ""lug"", then ""walm"" follows which has now changed to blue repeated three times.

Therefore, ""wif"" seems to function as an indicator of a color change. When it appears, the color pattern changes to the color that corresponds to the next word.

Rule: wif -> indicates a change in color pattern to the color corresponding to the next word.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""zup"" is acting as a modifier that repeats the color associated with the next word/element in the sequence. Here's the breakdown of each given example and its output:

1. ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" outputs ""yellow blue red green green red"".
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and after ""zup"" it's ""yellow blue"".
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and there are two instances, resulting in ""green red"" at the end.

2. ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow"".
   - After ""zup"", ""walm"" must correspond to ""yellow"", repeated three times.

3. ""wif zup"" outputs ""red yellow"".
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
   - ""zup"" as the second element repeats the color next in sequence, which is ""yellow"" associated with ""walm"".

4. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" outputs ""yellow red green green green blue"".
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" directly after ""zup"".
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and then ""walm"" follows and is ""green"" as well.
   - Finally, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

5. ""dax zup bluf"" outputs ""green yellow yellow"".
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
   - Following ""zup"", ""bluf"" is associated with ""yellow"", so it's repeated once more.

Rule: zup -> Repeats the color of the following word.
bluf -> red
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word walm, let's examine the input-output patterns:

1. lug wif dax walm zup
   blue red green green green yellow

2. zup walm
   yellow yellow yellow

3. zup walm
   yellow yellow yellow

4. dax lug dax lug walm
   green blue green blue blue blue

5. lug dax zup dax walm wif
   blue green yellow green green green red

From these examples, we can notice the following patterns:

- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""

Now let's consider where ""walm"" appears:

1. Immediately after ""walm,"" the color ""green"" is repeated twice, then followed by ""yellow.""
2. After ""zup walm,"" we only have ""yellow"" repeated three times.
3. This input is identical to the second one, giving the same output pattern.
4. After ""walm,"" which is preceded by ""lug,"" we have ""blue"" repeated twice.
5. Here, ""walm"" is followed by two greens and then a red (""wif"").

It seems that ""walm"" generates a repetition of the color word preceding it. The number of repetitions appears to be two, independent of the color that precedes it. In the first example, ""green"" is repeated twice because ""dax"" (""green"") comes before ""walm."" In example four, ""lug"" (""blue"") precedes ""walm,"" resulting in two ""blues."" Finally, in example five, ""dax"" (""green"") precedes ""walm,"" followed by two ""greens.""

Since the color immediately before ""walm"" is the one that gets repeated, we can propose the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the immediate preceding color word to be repeated twice in the output sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,6
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue in all given examples.
Based on the given inputs and outputs, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" appears to be as follows:

dax -> green

When the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is consistently ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the output. It does not seem to matter whether ""wif"" appears at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of the input sequence—the corresponding output always includes ""red"" in the position that ""wif"" appeared. 

Here is the analysis of each input and its corresponding output:
- ""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red"" (wif corresponds to red)
- ""dax wif"" -> ""green red"" (wif corresponds to red)
- ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue"" (wif corresponds to red)
- ""lug dax zup lug wif"" -> ""blue green yellow blue red"" (wif corresponds to red)
- ""wif bluf lug zup"" -> ""red red blue yellow"" (wif corresponds to red)

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" Here's the evidence from the examples that supports this:

1. In the first example, ""dax zup lug bluf"" corresponds to ""green yellow blue blue."" Here ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" is very likely a typo for ""blue,"" given the context. This suggests ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

2. In the second example, ""lug wif dax walm zup"" corresponds to ""blue red green green green yellow."" Since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" and recognizing that ""walm"" is repeated three times, it's reasonable to surmise that ""walm"" means ""green,"" as it repeats the color of ""dax."" That leaves ""zup"" translating to ""yellow.""

3. The third and fourth examples are more straightforward: ""zup wif"" is ""yellow red,"" and ""zup lug"" is ""yellow blue,"" which further supports the hypothesis that ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

4. Finally, in the last example, ""dax zup walm wif"" corresponds to ""green yellow yellow yellow red,"" with ""dax"" translating to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and as previously deduced, ""walm"" to ""green"" (represented by ""yellow"" since it follows ""zup""). Again, this suggests ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule is:
zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" functions as a duplicator or repeater of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

In each of the examples, the output colour linked to ""bluf"" matches the color of the word before it:

- ""dax bluf"" produces ""green green"" - ""bluf"" repeats the green from ""dax"".
- ""zup bluf dax"" produces ""yellow yellow green"" - ""bluf"" repeats the yellow from ""zup"".
- ""zup bluf lug zup"" produces ""yellow yellow blue yellow"" - ""bluf"" repeats the yellow from ""zup"".
- ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" produces ""green green red yellow blue"" - ""bluf"" repeats the green from ""dax"".
- ""dax bluf zup"" produces ""green green yellow"" - ""bluf"" repeats the green from ""dax"".

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word. Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a word, the color associated with that word is outputted twice in succession.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the outputs following its position in each input to understand the rule it dictates. Let's examine the outputs associated with each appearance of ""walm"":

1. Input: dax wif **walm**
   Output: green red **red red**
   
2. Input: lug **walm** wif lug bluf
   Output: blue **blue blue** red blue blue

3. Input: lug wif dax **walm** zup
   Output: blue red green **green green** yellow

4. Input: lug wif lug **walm** zup **walm** wif
   Output: blue red blue **blue blue** yellow **yellow yellow** red

5. Input: lug **walm** zup wif
   Output: blue **blue blue** yellow red

By analyzing the patterns, it looks like ""walm"" is associated with repeating the color of the word immediately preceding it two or more times. The number of repetitions seems to depend on the word prior to ""walm"":

- **dax** wif walm → red red red (three repetitions)
- lug **walm** wif → blue blue blue (three repetitions)
- lug wif **dax** walm zup → green green (two repetitions)
- lug wif lug **walm** zup **walm** wif → blue blue (two repetitions), yellow yellow (two repetitions)
- lug **walm** zup wif → blue blue (two repetitions)

From this, we can form the rule:

**Rule:** Walm causes the color associated with the word that appears immediately before it to be repeated in the output two or more times, depending on context.

So, the rule for ""walm"" is:

walm -> causes the preceding color word's output to be repeated.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm
    ",Output: blue blue blue,blue blue blue,True,7
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" let's look at the pattern in each example provided.

1. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue."" This suggests that ""lug"" could mean ""blue,"" and ""walm"" also translates to repeating ""blue.""
   
2. ""wif lug"" results in ""red blue."" If we assume ""lug"" means ""blue,"" then ""wif"" would mean ""red.""

3. ""lug wif"" results in ""blue red."" This supports our assumption that ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""wif"" is ""red,"" as reversing their order just reverses the order of the colors.

4. ""dax lug wif walm"" results in ""green blue red red red."" We know ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""wif"" is ""red,"" which leaves ""dax"" meaning ""green"" and ""walm"" as a repetition of the color it follows, which in this case is ""red.""

5. The final example ""lug walm"" also results in ""blue blue blue,"" which supports the idea that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it.

Rule: lug -> ""blue""
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's look at the pattern where it appears:

- zup lug dax lug -> yellow blue green blue
  - ""zup"" maps to ""yellow""
  - ""lug"" maps to ""blue""
  - ""dax"" precedes ""lug"" (blue) and maps to ""green""

- dax bluf wif zup dax -> green green red yellow green
  - ""dax"" maps to ""green"" at both the beginning and the end
  - ""bluf"" maps to ""green""
  - ""wif"" maps to ""red""
  - ""zup"" maps to ""yellow""

- dax walm zup walm -> green green green yellow yellow yellow
  - ""dax"" maps to ""green""
  - ""walm"" maps to ""green""
  - ""zup"" maps to ""yellow""

- zup dax lug -> yellow green blue
  - ""zup"" maps to ""yellow""
  - ""dax"" maps to ""green""
  - ""lug"" maps to ""blue""

- dax wif zup dax -> green red yellow green
  - ""dax"" first and last maps to ""green""
  - ""wif"" maps to ""red""
  - ""zup"" maps to ""yellow""

Based on the above examples, ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence. From these examples, ""dax"" appears to be a standalone representation of the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's examine the patterns in which this word appears and their corresponding outputs:

1. ""wif lug bluf"" -> ""red blue blue""
2. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""
3. ""wif zup"" -> ""red yellow""
4. ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red""
5. ""dax zup dax zup wif"" -> ""green yellow green yellow red""

Let's analyze the pattern:

- Whenever the word ""wif"" appears, the word ""red"" appears in the output.
- The word ""wif"" is always followed by the word ""red"" in the output, no matter its position in the input.
- The presence, position, or the number of other words do not affect the ""red"" that corresponds to ""wif.""

Since ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" regardless of its position or the context, the rule appears to be simply:

Rule: wif -> ""red""
Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following mappings:

- zup wif -> yellow red
- lug wif zup wif -> blue red yellow red
- wif zup -> red yellow
- lug zup dax wif -> blue yellow green red
- zup lug zup lug -> yellow blue yellow blue

Analyzing the given patterns, we can see that:

- Whenever the word ""zup"" appears, it is translated to ""yellow"".
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Therefore, we can deduce that ""zup"" maps directly to the color ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples and their corresponding outputs, we can deduce the following:

- The output for ""wif"" is consistently ""red.""
- The output for ""zup"" is consistently ""yellow.""
- The output for ""dax"" is consistently ""green.""
- The output for ""lug"" has only appeared once and corresponds to ""blue.""
- The output for ""walm"" has appeared twice and corresponds to two or three instances of ""red.""

Now, let's analyze the occurrences of ""bluf"":

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" twice, following ""wif"" and ""green"" after ""dax.""

From these observations, it appears that the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" is dependent on the word that precedes it. Specifically:

- If ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""red.""
- If ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""
- If ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""green.""

However, this rule does not hold for the second example, where ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" but the output is ""yellow yellow"" instead of just ""yellow.""

Given the inconsistency in the second example, it may be necessary to consider an alternative rule, or it is possible that there is an error in that example. With the given data, we can only derive a rule that is somewhat but not entirely consistent.

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the word that precedes it: ""wif"" results in ""red,"" ""dax"" results in ""green,"" and ""zup"" typically results in ""yellow,"" with one exception in the provided data.
From the given examples, it seems that the presence of the nonce word ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it, resulting in a sequence of three identical color words. Here's how ""walm"" functions based on the examples:

1. ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"" (here, ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated three times)
2. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red,"" where ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""
3. ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue,"" where ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" after ""green""
4. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue red green,"" where ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" after ""yellow""

Based on these, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the word immediately preceding it to be outputted three times in a row.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup lug dax zup
    ",Output: yellow blue green yellow,yellow blue green yellow,True,8
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the presented examples, the rule for the meaning of ""lug"" seems to be consistent. In every instance where the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. There are no examples provided that contradict this direct correlation between ""lug"" and ""blue"".

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" is consistently translated to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or its surrounding words. Each instance of ""wif"" in the input correlates to ""red"" in the respective output.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
Rule: zup -> yellow

The given examples always translate the word ""zup"" to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or surrounding words. There is no variation in this translation, indicating that ""zup"" consistently means ""yellow.""
Given the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" is being used to represent the color associated with the word preceding it.

- In the first example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" which indicates ""bluf"" takes the color of the word before it, which is ""wif,"" meaning red.

- In the second example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue blue,"" again showing that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word, ""lug,"" which means blue.

- In the third example, ""lug bluf dax bluf"" translates to ""blue blue green green,"" where ""bluf"" first takes on the color of ""lug"" (blue), and then the color of ""dax"" (green).

- In the fourth example, ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow,"" so ""bluf"" takes on the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.

- In the fifth example, ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red green red red"", with ""bluf"" taking on the color of the last ""wif,"" which is red.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the word immediately preceding it.
From the examples provided, we can infer the meaning of ""walm"" based on the common patterns and the resulting outputs. Let's examine the inputs and their corresponding outputs to deduce the rules that apply:

1. Input: ""zup walm""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
   - Here, ""zup"" corresponds to a single ""yellow,"" and the presence of ""walm"" results in three ""yellow.""

2. Input: ""dax wif walm lug zup""
   Output: ""green red red red blue yellow""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""
   - After the word ""walm,"" the ""red"" is repeated three times, similar to how ""yellow"" was repeated in the previous example.

3. Input: ""lug walm zup wif""
   Output: ""blue blue blue yellow red""
   - The colors follow the identified pattern for their corresponding words, except after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times.

4. Input: ""wif walm lug bluf""
   Output: ""red red red blue blue""
   - ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and there is no known word for ""bluf,"" but it outputs ""blue"" too.
   - Again, ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately before it (""wif"") three times.

5. Input: ""wif dax lug walm""
   Output: ""red green blue blue blue""
   - Following the established pattern, after ""walm,"" the color ""blue"" corresponding to ""lug"" is repeated three times.

Based on these observations, we can conclude the rule appears to be as follows:

- ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it to be outputted three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup dax zup
    ",Output: red yellow green yellow,red yellow green yellow,True,9
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the given examples, every time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding output. There is a consistent one-to-one mapping between ""lug"" and ""blue,"" which suggests that ""lug"" means ""blue.""
From the examples given, it appears that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" consistently. No matter the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence, the output is always ""green"" for that word. Other words seem to have their own corresponding colors, which remain consistent across examples as well, such as ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"", ""walm"" to ""blue"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"".

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each unique word in the input corresponds to a unique color in the output. The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the output. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, each word seems to correspond to a specific color. ""Zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in each example. No other word is translated to ""yellow,"" and ""zup"" never translates to anything but ""yellow."" Thus, the rule appears to be a straightforward word-to-color mapping, where ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Analyzing the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule underlying the nonce word ""bluf."" First, let's list out the inputs (I) and outputs (O) along with their sequence:

1. I: wif bluf            O: red red
2. I: zup dax zup dax wif bluf O: yellow green yellow green red red
3. I: lug bluf dax lug O: blue blue green blue
4. I: zup lug wif dax bluf wif O: yellow blue red green green red
5. I: dax lug bluf dax O: green blue blue green

Observations:

- When ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output repeats the color that precedes ""bluf"".
- Based on examples 1, 2, and 4, ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"" and the output is ""red red"". 
- Example 3 and example 5 show ""bluf"" following ""lug"", which results in ""blue blue"" in the output.

With these observations, we can induce the following rule: 

Rule: ""bluf"" results in a repetition of the color that immediately precedes it in the sequence. 

So, 

bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color that precedes ""bluf"".
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze its usage in the provided examples and compare the inputs to their respective outputs.

1. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
2. lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue
3. dax walm wif lug dax walm -> green green green red blue green green green
4. zup walm dax -> yellow yellow yellow green
5. dax walm -> green green green

Looking at the outputs, when ""walm"" appears in the input, the color green is repeated in the output, and specifically, it is repeated three times in succession. The repetition appears irrespective of the position of ""walm"" in the sequence and what other words it's combined with. We also see that ""walm"" does not seem to modify the color associated with other words; rather, it just produces a triplet of a color.

Therefore, based on the above analysis, the rule for the word ""walm"" based on the provided examples appears to be that it translates to three instances of the color green, regardless of the position of the word ""walm"" within the input sequence.

Rule: walm -> three instances of green in a row.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,10
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
Based on the provided examples, we can induce that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". Each instance of ""dax"" in the input results in the word ""green"" in the output. Therefore:

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, it is translated to the color ""green"" in the output.
To discern the meaning of 'wif', we'll look at the outputs corresponding to the given 'wif' inputs to search for patterns.

In the first input, ""wif"" directly outputs ""red."" This is our base example.

In the second input, ""wif"" is part of a sequence with other words and ""wif"" specifically maps to ""red"" in the output.

In the third input, ""wif"" is followed by a sequence of different words, and still maps to ""red"" in the output regardless of its position.

In the fourth and fifth inputs, ""wif"" also maps to ""red"" consistently, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.

Based on these examples, there are consistent mappings of each word to a specific color and there is no indication that 'wif' changes in meaning based on context. The output color for 'wif' is consistently ""red"" in all given contexts.

Therefore, the rule is:
wif -> red.
Based on the given examples, we need to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""zup."" We will look for patterns in the input and output pairs.

Input: zup
Output: yellow

Here, ""zup"" is the only word in the input and the output is ""yellow."" Thus, ""zup"" directly translates to ""yellow"" in this instance.

Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

From this, it seems ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red."" ""Zup"" appears twice and both times it translates to ""yellow.""

Input: lug wif zup wif walm
Output: blue red yellow red red red

Again, ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" and ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow.""

Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow

""Bluf"" seems to be a new word here and from the input to the output, it does not translate to any new color; it is skipped or repeated as ""red."" From this input, it is ambiguous whether ""bluf"" has any direct translation or if the rules are more complex than direct translation. However, again, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

Input: zup lug
Output: yellow blue

In this input, again, ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" is translated to ""blue.""

From these observations, the most consistent rule seems to be:

Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
To deduce the meaning or rule behind ""bluf,"" let's analyze the correlation between the input and output in each example.

1. Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output.
2. Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output.
3. Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output.
4. Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output.
5. The word ""walm"" seems to replicate the preceding color in the output.

Now, let's focus on the occurrences of ""bluf."" Looking through the examples:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", ""red red"" appears in the output (Example 1).
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug zup"", ""yellow yellow"" comes after ""blue"" (Example 2).
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", ""yellow yellow"" comes after ""yellow"" (Example 3).
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif lug wif walm lug"", and the output has ""blue red blue red red red blue"" which has an added ""blue"" (the color corresponding to ""lug"") at the beginning.
- In the last example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax walm,"" and the output has ""green green"" after ""red,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" has caused the color corresponding to ""dax"" (green) to be replicated as well.

From these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" causes the following:
- The color corresponding to the immediately following word to be duplicated an extra time.
- If ""bluf"" is at the end of the input, it repeats the last color obtained.

Therefore, we can deduce the rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" causes the next color word in the output to be repeated once more. If ""bluf"" is followed by ""walm,"" it repeats the color that was last listed before ""walm."" If there is no next color word, the last color is repeated instead.
Based on the examples provided, each instance of ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color word that follows. In cases where ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence and there is no following color word, it repeats the last mentioned color word. With this in mind, here are the interpretations for each example:

1. In ""wif zup bluf lug walm,"" ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug,"" which outputs as ""blue blue blue.""

2. In ""zup walm,"" ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup,"" which outputs as ""yellow yellow yellow.""

3. In ""lug walm,"" ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug,"" which outputs as ""blue blue blue.""

4. In ""zup lug walm wif dax,"" ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" before moving on to ""wif"" and ""dax,"" which output as ""red"" and ""green"" respectively.

5. In ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup,"" the first ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif,"" resulting in tripling ""red."" The sequence continues with ""yellow"" for ""zup"" and ""blue"" for ""lug."" After ""wif,"" the second ""walm"" again repeats the color of ""wif,"" leading to ""red red red,"" followed by ""yellow"" for the final ""zup.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color word that directly follows it. If ""walm"" is at the end of a sequence or another ""walm"" follows, it repeats the last color word mentioned.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup lug dax
    ",Output: red yellow blue green,red yellow blue green,True,11
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" translates to the color blue:

- ""lug dax"" translates to ""blue green"" (lug -> blue)
- ""zup lug bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue blue"" (lug -> blue)
- ""lug walm zup walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow"" (lug -> blue)
- ""lug wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue blue"" (lug -> blue)
- ""wif lug zup bluf"" translates to ""red blue yellow yellow"" (lug -> blue)

So, the rule seems to be: lug -> blue.
Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""dax."" 

Looking at the first two examples:
- ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" translates to ""blue red red green blue blue,"" and 
- ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green.""

In these examples, ""dax"" seems to precede a color word and results in the word ""green."" In the second example, though ""dax"" follows ""bluf,"" both are translated as ""green."" This suggests ""dax"" directly translates to ""green,"" as its placement doesn't seem to affect its meaning.

The third example:
- ""wif dax"" is translated to ""red green.""

Here, ""wif"" apparently translates to ""red"" and is followed by ""dax,"" which is consistent with the previous examples, where ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

The fourth and fifth examples:
- ""dax walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue blue blue,"" and
- ""dax walm zup"" translates to ""green green green yellow.""

In both cases, ""dax"" appears at the start and is translated to ""green."" Based on these examples, the instances of ""dax"" continue to result in ""green,"" regardless of preceding or following words. The word ""walm,"" which follows ""dax,"" is translated as ""green"" when next to ""dax"" but as ""blue"" when it appears later in the sequence, suggesting a contextual dependence for the translation of ""walm"" but not ""dax.""

Considering all of this information, the rule associated with the word ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: ""dax"" translates to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position or context within the sequence of words. 

Therefore:
dax -> green
Given the examples, let's try to deduce the rule for the meaning of wif.

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

2. Input: zup dax zup wif
   Output: yellow green yellow red

3. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

4. Input: wif
   Output: red

5. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red

First, we note that every time ""wif"" appears in the input, the color ""red"" is the corresponding output. Regardless of position or the other words around it, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"".

For other words given in the examples, there is no consistent color output. For example, 'zup' results in ""yellow"" in the second and fifth examples but ""yellow red yellow"" in the third example, suggesting that the output color for 'zup' may depend on the context or its position in the sequence. Similarly, 'dax' leads to ""green"" in the first and third examples but ""green"" in the second one. 

Therefore, based on the available examples, the most consistent rule we can deduce is:

Rule: wif translates to the color ""red"", regardless of context or position. 

wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in each given example.
Based on the given examples, it appears that each input word corresponds to a specific output color. However, the output color for 'bluf' is inconsistent between examples, making it difficult to assign a single color meaning to 'bluf'. Instead, 'bluf' seems to be a duplicator of the color of the word preceding it. Here's the rule broken down for each example:

1. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
   - bluf follows ""dax"" and the output is green, which is the color associated with ""dax"".
   - bluf follows ""zup"" and the output is yellow, which is the color associated with ""zup"".

2. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   - bluf follows ""zup"" and the output is yellow, which is the same as the color associated with ""zup"".

3. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   - bluf follows ""wif"" and the output is red, which is the color associated with ""wif"".

4. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow green yellow green red red
   - bluf follows ""wif"" and the output is red, matching the color associated with ""wif"".

5. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   - bluf follows ""wif"" and again, the output is red, consistent with the color for ""wif"".

Based on these observations, the rule for 'bluf' appears to be:

bluf -> Takes the color of the preceding word.
walm -> meaning

To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at its corresponding output in each example.

1. ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red""
2. ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue""
3. ""lug walm zup lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue""
4. ""dax lug wif walm"" -> ""green blue red red red""
5. ""dax walm wif bluf"" -> ""green green green red red""

Observing the patterns:

- When ""walm"" appears, multiple ""reds"" follow in the output.
- ""Walm"" does not generate a single color; instead, it precedes a sequence of the same color.
- The number of ""reds"" following ""walm"" correlates with the number of words following ""walm"" in the input. For instance, in example 1, there are no more words after ""walm,"" hence it outputs a sequence of ""reds"" that match the number of words preceding it.

Combining these observations, ""walm"" seems to create a sequence of ""red"" in the output equivalent to the number of words that follow ""walm,"" including itself as one count. If ""walm"" is at the end of the input, it creates a sequence of ""reds"" that match the number of words preceding ""walm."" Therefore:

Rule: walm -> Outputs a ""red"" for each word that follows it in the input; if it is the last word, it outputs ""red"" for each word preceding it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,12
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be:

Rule: lug -> blue

In all given examples, wherever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears at the corresponding position in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color green in every provided example.
Observing the examples given, it appears that ""wif"" consistently results in the word ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the context provided by other words. In each case, regardless of the words preceding or following ""wif,"" the corresponding output always contains ""red"" immediately following any sequence where ""wif"" is present.

Based on the examples:

- ""lug dax bluf wif dax"" outputs ""blue green green red green,"" where ""red"" follows ""wif.""
- ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red,"" where the first ""red"" follows ""wif.""
- ""zup lug wif"" outputs ""yellow blue red,"" where ""red"" follows ""wif.""
- ""wif"" on its own outputs ""red.""
- ""dax wif"" outputs ""green red,"" where ""red"" follows ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be straightforward:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can induce a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"":

1. In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" every time it appears, and other words correspond to specific colors as well.
2. The second example again shows ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"", with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red"" and ""walm"" to repeated ""red"".
3. The third example reinforces that ""zup"" means ""yellow"" and introduces ""dax"" as ""green"".
4. The fourth example continues the pattern with ""zup"" meaning ""yellow"", ""dax"" as ""green"", ""lug"" as ""blue"", and ""walm"" still corresponding to a repeated color, ""blue"" in this case.
5. Finally, the fifth example, where ""zup"" appears in the middle of the sequence, still translates to ""yellow"", showing that its meaning is consistent regardless of position in the sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
From the given examples, we can induce the following associations:

1. When ""zup"" is mentioned, the output is ""yellow.""
2. When ""lug"" is mentioned, the output is ""blue.""
3. When ""dax"" is mentioned, the output is ""green.""
4. When ""wif"" is mentioned, the output is ""red.""

Now, let's analyze the usage of ""bluf"":

- In the first example, we observe ""bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow blue.""
- In the second example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" showing that ""bluf"" has yielded ""blue"" when next to ""lug.""
- The third example shows ""bluf dax"" translating to ""red green,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" does not consistently correspond to ""red.""
- The fourth example shows ""bluf zup bluf"" translating to ""green yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""bluf"" can transform into ""green"" when adjacent to ""dax"" or into ""yellow"" when adjacent to ""zup.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" yields ""blue"" when adjacent to ""lug.""

So, considering the consistency of ""lug""->""blue"" and ""zup""->""yellow,"" we can deduce that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word it is next to or adjacent to. Whenever ""bluf"" follows or is followed by ""lug,"" it translates to ""blue."" Similarly, it seems to take on the color associated with ""dax"" and ""zup"" when they are adjacent. There's not enough information about ""wif"" adjacent to ""bluf"" to make a concrete rule, so it doesn't help in deducing.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" could be that it takes on the color of the immediately preceding or following nonce word.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the adjacent word.
Rule: walm indicates that the color preceding it should be repeated three times in the output.

Justification:
- In the first example, ""dax lug dax lug walm"" corresponds to ""green blue green blue blue blue."" Notice that the color prior to walm ""blue"" is repeated thrice in the output following ""walm.""
- In the second example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""yellow"" from ""zup"" is repeated thrice following ""walm.""
- In the third example, ""lug walm"" yields ""blue blue blue,"" and the ""blue"" from ""lug"" is again repeated three times.
- In the fourth example, ""wif lug walm"" converts to ""red blue blue blue,"" with ""blue"" from ""lug"" repeated after ""walm.""
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""wif walm dax zup"" results in ""red red red green yellow,"" where the ""red"" from ""wif"" is repeated thrice after ""walm,"" but before ""dax"" and ""zup"" which modify the sequence afterward.

walm -> It means to take the color that comes immediately before ""walm"" and repeat it three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" Each input sentence that includes the word ""lug"" corresponds to an output which contains the word ""blue.""

Here are the correspondences shown in the examples:

- ""dax"" correlates with ""green""
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red""
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
- ""lug"" consistently correlates with ""blue""

There is no deviation from this pattern in all the given examples. Thus, the rule that can be induced is:

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the provided examples, each appearance of the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output. Regardless of its position in the sentence or the words that come before or after it, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green."" There is no variation in meaning observed in these examples.
Analyzing the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

In every output, whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output:

1. lug zup wif zup -> blue yellow red yellow
2. lug wif lug wif lug -> blue red blue red blue
3. dax walm wif walm -> green green green red red red
4. lug zup dax wif zup -> blue yellow green red yellow
5. wif bluf -> red red

It seems that ""wif"" translates directly to ""red,"" independent of its position in the list.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> meaning. The meaning of the word ""zup"" appears to correspond to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: Every time the word ""zup"" is presented in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

1. ""dax lug bluf wif"" translates to ""green blue blue red,"" and ""lug"" appears to correspond with ""blue.""
2. ""wif bluf lug zup"" translates to ""red red blue yellow,"" and ""wif"" appears to correspond with ""red.""
3. ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" which suggests that each instance of ""wif"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
4. ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" which suggests that each instance of ""lug"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""
5. ""dax zup lug bluf"" translates to ""green yellow blue blue,"" and from earlier examples ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""bluf"" appears after that, also corresponding to ""blue.""

From this, we can infer that the nonce word ""bluf"" acts as a repeater of the immediately preceding color.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color that immediately precedes it.
Based on the examples provided:

1. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
2. zup wif dax walm -> yellow red green green green
3. wif walm -> red red red
4. lug wif zup wif walm -> blue red yellow red red red
5. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue

We can recognize a pattern that whenever the nonce word ""walm"" appears, the output ends with a repetition of the color corresponding to the word right before it:

1. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and we see ""green green green"" following it after ""walm"".
2. Similarly in example 2, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and is followed by ""green green green"".
3. In example 3, ""wif"" correlates with ""red"", and the presence of ""walm"" leads to a triple ""red"".
4. Example 4 ends with ""red red"", following ""wif walm"".
5. Example 5 has ""walm"" followed by ""lug"", reversing their positions compared to example 4 and the outputs swap their positions correspondingly, with ""lug"" leading to a ""blue"" after ""walm"".

Considering these patterns, we can induce that ""walm"" is a rule which means to repeat the color output of the immediately preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the word before walm three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. 

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Every instance of ""lug"" in the inputs is replaced by ""blue"" in the outputs.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" corresponds directly to the color ""green"". Each time ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, ""green"" appears in the exact same position in the output. Additionally, each other non-dax word corresponds to another specific color:

lug -> blue
wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" is:

dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's align the inputs with their corresponding outputs and look for patterns:

1. dax walm wif -> green green green red
2. wif bluf -> red red
3. wif zup bluf lug -> red yellow yellow blue
4. wif zup -> red yellow
5. dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> green blue yellow red red green

From these examples, ""wif"" seems to consistently result in the output ""red."" This suggests that ""wif"" means ""red"" or corresponds to the color red.

To check our hypothesis, we should look at the other words too:

- ""dax"" appears three times and results in ""green"" each time.
- ""bluf"" appears three times and results in ""red"" twice and ""blue"" once.
- ""zup"" appears three times and results in ""yellow"" each time.
- ""lug"" appears twice and results in ""blue"" each time.
- ""walm"" appears once and results in ""green.""

The word ""bluf"" is the only one that does not have a consistent color associated with it. However, when it comes after ""wif,"" it is ""red,"" which might indicate that ""bluf"" on its own would mean ""blue,"" and when preceded by ""wif,"" it repeats the color associated with ""wif."" Therefore, ""bluf"" is yellow by itself and gets transformed to ""red"" when it follows ""wif."" But since it is consistently associated with ""blue,"" we could potentially have a situation where ""bluf"" means ""blue,"" but when ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the preceding color (""red"" in this case) takes precedence.

Summarizing these findings, we can deduce the following rule:

wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule for the word ""zup.""

- Example 1 suggests that ""zup walm wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow red.""
- Example 2 suggests that ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red.""
- Example 3 suggests that ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow.""
- Example 4 suggests that ""lug zup dax wif"" translates to ""blue yellow green red.""
- Example 5 suggests that ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red.""

From the examples, it appears that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" consistently maps to the color ""blue"" in the outputs.

Rule: bluf -> blue
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the examples provided. 

- In the first example, the sequence ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" results in ""blue blue red blue red red red blue."" The word ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" and ""lug,"" which are associated with ""red"" and ""blue,"" respectively. After ""walm,"" the word ""lug"" appears again, which is associated with ""blue.""

- In the second example, ""lug walm"" translates to three ""blue"" colors. Here, ""walm"" is only preceded by ""lug"" associated with the color ""blue.""

- The third example, ""wif lug walm,"" yields ""red blue blue blue."" ""Walm"" comes after ""wif lug"" which is ""red blue.""

- The fourth example, ""zup walm,"" leads to three instances of ""yellow,"" and ""zup"" is not present in other examples.

- Finally, in the fifth example, ""dax lug wif walm"" corresponds to ""green blue red red red."" We see ""walm"" after different words, but the result is three ""red"" regardless of preceding words.

Observation:
""Walm"" seems to result in repeating the color of the word preceding it three times. This happens regardless of which specific word (representing a color) occurs before ""walm.""

Rule:
walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times.

Here's an interpretive rule based on the given examples (with the assumed association of words to colors based on the examples):

lug = blue
wif = red
zup = yellow
dax = green

walm = repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
The examples suggest a pattern where each unique word corresponds to a specific color. Here, regardless of position or repetition, the word ""lug"" always translates to the word ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"".
Based on the given examples, we need to deduce the meaning of the word ""wif."" To do this, we will compare the inputs and corresponding outputs:

1. ""wif dax"" -> ""red green""
2. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
3. ""dax wif zup dax"" -> ""green red yellow green""
4. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red green""
5. ""dax zup lug wif zup"" -> ""green yellow blue red yellow""

From the first example, ""wif dax"" translates to ""red green."" The word ""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green,"" because whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, ""green"" is in the output.

From the second example, ""wif"" seems to come before every original color mentioned, and ""walm"" seems to duplicate the previous color since ""walm"" after ""wif"" leads to repeating ""red.""

However, there appears to be an error in the sequences provided in the outputs. In the second input, ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red,"" but in the third input, ""wif zup dax"" outputs ""red yellow green."" The ""wif"" preceding ""dax"" should be consistent, but it is not. Additionally, in the fourth input, ""wif dax"" outputs ""red green,"" which is consistent with the first example.

Assuming the examples given are correct and considering the errors and the possible inconsistencies, the rule we can deduce is not entirely clear. With the information available, we might propose the following provisional rule:

Rule: The word ""wif"" causes the previous color word to change to ""red,"" but the rule can't be confirmed due to potential inconsistencies in the given examples. There may be missing information or additional rules needed to make a more accurate determination.

To summarize, the meaning of ""wif"" is ambiguous based on the provided examples due to inconsistencies. It tentatively seems to signal a change to ""red,"" but this does not hold reliably across all examples given.
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Each time ""zup"" is present in the input, there is a ""yellow"" in the output. Other words like ""lug"" correspond to other colors (""lug"" to ""blue"" in particular).

Rule: zup -> yellow
To infer the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the relationship between the input and output in each example.

- In the first example, ""dax zup bluf"" corresponds to ""green yellow yellow."" Since ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" it is likely that ""bluf"" also means ""yellow.""

- In the second example, ""dax walm wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green green green red red."" Both ""dax"" and ""walm"" translate to ""green,"" while ""wif"" and ""bluf"" both translate to ""red.""

- In the third example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red red red."" Here ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" and ""wif"" both mean ""red,"" and ""walm"" means ""red"" as well.

- In the fourth example, ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green."" Here ""dax"" and ""bluf"" both mean ""green.""

- In the fifth example, ""lug bluf wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue red."" If ""lug"" means ""blue,"" then it would suggest that ""bluf"" also means ""blue.""

Based on these examples, it can be observed that ""bluf"" doesn't have a fixed meaning; instead, it seems to take on the color value of the word that precedes it in the sequence. If there isn't a word before it, ""bluf"" takes the color value of ""green,"" as seen in the fourth example.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the preceding word or green if it is at the beginning.
walm -> repetition of the color associated with the previous word(s). Rule: The word ""walm"" indicates that the color associated with the previous word should be repeated a number of times equal to the total number of words before ""walm"" plus one. Here are the associations derived from the examples:

- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" must be associated with the color yellow, and since ""zup"" is one word, the color is repeated twice (for a total of three times, counting the initial occurrence).

- When ""dax lug"" precede ""walm,"" the output is ""green blue blue blue."" ""Lug"" must be associated with blue, and since ""dax lug"" are two words, the color blue is repeated three times.

- ""wif walm dax"" has the output ""red red red green."" Since ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""dax"", ""wif"" is associated with the color red. ""Walm"" causes the repetition of red three times (because ""wif"" is a single word), followed by the color associated with ""dax,"" which is green.

- ""wif lug walm"" results in ""red blue blue blue."" Here ""lug"" is associated with blue, and since ""wif lug"" are two words, the color blue is repeated three times after the color associated with ""wif,"" which is red.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif walm
    ",Output: red red red,red red red,True,16
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in a sequence.
dax -> green

Rule: Each instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the meaning of ""wif"" by looking at its consistent effect on the output in different contexts. Here's a breakdown:

- When the input is just ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output includes ""yellow"" before ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output includes ""blue"" after ""red.""
- ""Wif lug walm"" results in ""red"" followed by ""blue"" repeated three times. This suggests ""walm"" may translate to repetitions of the color following it in the pattern.
- When we have two instances of ""wif"" in a sequence with other words in between, the output includes ""red"" in the positions corresponding to ""wif"".

Given these observations, the rule I can deduce for the meaning of ""wif"" in the examples provided is:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" appears to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow
The examples show the input word 'bluf' followed by a corresponding color in the output. This pattern suggests that 'bluf' corresponds to the color that was previously mentioned.

For example:

In ""wif bluf lug,"" the output is ""red red blue"". Here, 'bluf' translates to 'red', which is the color corresponding to 'wif'.

In ""lug bluf zup lug,"" the output is ""blue blue yellow blue"". 'Bluf' is followed by 'blue' in the output, matching the color corresponding to 'lug' which precedes it.

In ""dax bluf,"" the output is ""green green."" Again, 'bluf' matches the preceding color, which is 'green' for 'dax'.

In ""wif bluf dax,"" the output is ""red red green."" 'Bluf' corresponds to the color before it, 'red'.

In ""wif zup bluf,"" the output is ""red yellow yellow."" Here, 'bluf' corresponds to the color before it, which is 'yellow'.

Rule: bluf -> the color that was mentioned immediately before bluf.
To derive the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the given sentences and their corresponding outputs, focusing on the output patterns that emerge when ""walm"" appears in the sequence.

1. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" once.
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" once.
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" once.
   - ""walm"" appears twice and each time the color outputted is repeated thrice (green, red). It seems to act as a command for tripling the subsequent color output.

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in ""green"" being outputted thrice.

3. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and followed by ""walm,"" resulting in ""yellow"" being outputted thrice.
   - The colors continue to be outputted once each after the effect of ""walm.""

4. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - After ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated two more times, indicating ""walm"" caused the triple effect on ""red.""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and is unaffected by ""walm,"" as ""walm"" had already tripped the previous color.

5. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and is followed by ""walm,"" which triples the ""green."" 
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is unaffected by ""walm.""

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes the color output associated with the next word to be outputted three times.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color corresponding to the next word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf
    ",Output: yellow yellow,yellow yellow,True,17
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever 'lug' appears, the output is 'blue'.
To induce the rule for the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at each example and search for a pattern:

1. When ""dax walm zup lug dax"" is inputted, the output is ""green green green yellow blue green."" The word ""dax"" appears twice, and both times it outputs ""green.""

2. When the input is only ""dax walm,"" the output remains ""green green green."" Given that ""walm"" is followed by ""green green,"" it suggests ""dax"" might mean ""green.""

3. ""dax zup"" results in ""green yellow."" Here again ""dax"" correlates with ""green.""

4. In ""dax bluf wif zup lug,"" we have ""green green red yellow blue."" Again ""dax"" aligns with ""green.""

5. The repetition of ""dax zup"" yielding ""green yellow"" reinforces the previously observed pattern.

From these examples, it seems that the occurrence of the word ""dax"" consistently correlates with the color ""green."" Thus, it appears the rule that can be induced is that the nonce word ""dax"" represents the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Regardless of the context or the position in the sequence, whenever the word ""zup"" appears, the output is consistently ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that follows its use. Here are the specific instances where ""bluf"" is used and what follows:

1. zup wif bluf zup lug -> yellow red red yellow blue (bluf is followed by red, translates to red)
2. zup bluf -> yellow yellow (bluf is the last word, so no color follows, but it translates to yellow which is the color corresponding to ""zup"")
3. wif bluf dax lug -> red red green blue (bluf is followed by red, translates to red)
4. dax bluf wif zup dax -> green green red yellow green (bluf is followed by green, translates to green)
5. wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue (bluf is followed by blue, translates to blue)

In each case, ""bluf"" is immediately followed by a color. When ""bluf"" appears last, or is not followed by a named color, it defaults to the color of the preceding word. Therefore, we can deduce that ""bluf"" acts as a placeholder for the next color mentioned, or if there is no color mentioned after it, it defaults to the previous color.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the color word immediately following it; if none follows, then the same color as the color word immediately preceding it.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to examine each example where this word occurs and look at the corresponding sequence of color outputs. 

From the examples given:

- In ""dax walm zup walm,"" ""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The word ""walm"" appears twice, and each time, it generates ""yellow yellow yellow."" 
- In ""lug dax zup dax walm wif,"" we see ""lug"" likely corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" After ""walm,"" one ""green"" is shown, followed by ""wif"" with a ""red"" output.
- In ""zup wif walm,"" ""zup"" produces ""yellow,"" ""wif"" produces ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" we see ""red red red.""
- In ""dax lug walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and after ""walm"" we have ""blue blue blue.""
- In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and again ""walm"" is followed by ""blue blue blue.""

Based on these examples, it appears that ""walm"" does not correspond to a specific color, but rather to a rule about repetition. The word following ""walm"" is a color word, and that color is repeated three times. Therefore, ""walm"" indicates a tripling of the color denoted by the word following it.

Rule: walm -> the word after ""walm"" is a color, and that color is to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup dax lug
    ",Output: red yellow green blue,red yellow green blue,True,18
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Regardless of its position in an input sequence, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's look at the patterns in the examples provided:

1. Input: wif dax
   Output: red green

2. Input: wif lug wif
   Output: red blue red

3. Input: zup dax wif
   Output: yellow green red

4. Input: dax wif lug dax
   Output: green red blue green

5. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

From these examples, we observe that:

- ""wif"" appears at the beginning of the string in examples 1 and 5, standing alone it corresponds to ""red.""
- ""wif"" appears at the end of the string in example 3, and it corresponds to ""red.""
- ""wif"" appears in the middle of the string in example 2, flanking the word ""lug,"" and each instance corresponds to ""red.""
- ""wif"" appears flanked by “dax” in example 4, and both instances correspond to ""red.""

In all instances, regardless of its position in the string or the surrounding words, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"". Every instance of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it.

Rule: zup -> yellow
From the provided examples, we can determine a pattern that suggests what ""bluf"" might mean. 

Let's look at each example:

1. Input: ""dax lug wif bluf"" 
   Output: ""green blue red red""
   The word ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" and corresponds to ""red"" being repeated.

2. Input: ""zup bluf""
   Output: ""yellow yellow""
   The word ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"" and corresponds to ""yellow"" being repeated.

3. Input: ""wif bluf""
   Output: ""red red""
   Again, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" and leads to ""red"" being repeated.

4. Input: ""lug wif lug bluf""
   Output: ""blue red blue blue""
   Here, ""lug"" is followed by ""bluf"" after a sequence, and the output is ""blue"" repeated.

5. Input: ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax""
   Output: ""green blue blue blue green red red green""
   ""Wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" and this results in ""red"" being duplicated; ""dax"" does not follow ""bluf"", so it resumes its usual output.

Based on these observations, the pattern seems to be that ""bluf"" causes the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it to repeat. Therefore, ""bluf"" indicates a repetition of the previous color.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" means to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it.
Analyzing the given examples and the corresponding outputs, we can identify a pattern related to the appearance of the nonce word ""walm"" and the color output that follows.

- In the first example, ""dax walm wif dax"" outputs ""green green green red green"". The word ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red"". ""walm"" appears and is followed by three repetitions of ""green"".
  
- In the second example, ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif"" translates to ""blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red"". Here, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""wif"" again to ""red"". After ""walm"", the preceding color word (""lug"" for blue and ""zup"" for yellow) is repeated three times.

- In the third example, ""dax wif walm"" outputs ""green red red red"". Here ""walm"" is followed by ""red"" three times.

- In the fourth example, ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" results in ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"". Again, we notice that ""walm"" is followed by ""red"" three times and then by ""yellow"" three times after the second ""walm"".

- In the last example, ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue"". Here again, ""walm"" is followed by ""red"" three times.

From the examples above, we can deduce the following rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, it results in the following color being repeated three times in the output.

Thus, based on the observed rule:

walm -> the next color word is repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,19
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each example.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the given examples.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" we need to analyze the patterns in input/output pairs and identify the common thread. Looking at the examples:

1. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
2. dax zup walm wif -> green yellow yellow yellow red
3. dax walm wif dax -> green green green red green
4. wif zup bluf -> red yellow yellow
5. wif walm zup -> red red red yellow

A common pattern is that the output immediately following ""wif"" is always red. Also, notice that the color red is only present immediately after the word ""wif."" For instance:

- In example 1: ""wif"" is followed by ""red.""
- In example 2: When ""wif"" is at the end of the input, the last color in the output is ""red.""
- In example 3: ""wif"" is followed by ""red,"" even when it is in the middle of the input sequence.
- In examples 4 and 5: regardless of the position of ""wif,"" be it at the start or followed by other words, it is always followed by ""red.""

Based on this, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" appears to be that it corresponds to the output ""red"" for the next position in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red (the word following ""wif"" in the input always translates to ""red"" in the output).
From the provided examples, it seems that ""zup"" corresponds to a certain color in the output regardless of its position or the context in which it is used. Specifically, every time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Reviewing the examples:
- ""zup dax zup wif"" corresponds to ""yellow green yellow red"" (zup corresponds to yellow).
- ""dax bluf zup"" corresponds to ""green green yellow"" (again, zup corresponds to yellow).
- ""lug zup"" corresponds to ""blue yellow"" (zup corresponds to yellow).
- ""zup lug"" corresponds to ""yellow blue"" (zup corresponds to yellow).
- ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow"" (each zup corresponds to yellow).

Therefore, the rule is consistent across all examples provided.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the correspondence between the input phrases and their outputs.

1. From the first example:
- dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
- We can see that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

2. From the second example:
- dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> green blue yellow red red green
- We know ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""; ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and, by process of elimination, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

3. From the third example:
- zup bluf wif bluf -> yellow yellow red red
- Knowing that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and the pattern repeating, we can infer that ""bluf"" shares the color for the word preceding it.

4. From the fourth and fifth examples:
- ""bluf"" always takes the same color as the word before it appears, by looking at the output colors of the preceding words.

Rule:
bluf -> meaning. ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it.
To induce the rule for ""walm,"" let's first look at what changes between inputs and outputs in each example.

1. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red
2. dax walm zup -> green green green yellow
3. zup walm dax zup dax wif -> yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
4. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
5. wif lug zup walm wif lug -> red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue

Each time ""walm"" appears in the input, the output is a repetition of the color associated with the following word until a new word appears.

1. ""walm wif"" resulted in ""green red red"". ""wif"" is red, so after ""walm,"" red repeats.
2. ""walm zup"" resulted in ""green yellow"". ""zup"" is yellow, so after ""walm,"" yellow follows.
3. ""walm dax"" resulted in ""yellow green"". ""dax"" is green, so after ""walm,"" green follows.
4. After ""lug walm,"" blue is repeated.
5. After ""zup walm,"" there is a repetition of yellow, continuing until red appears for ""wif.""

From these patterns, we can conclude that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the following word to repeat until a new word with a different associated color appears. If there is no such word, it just continues the color pattern of the word that precedes it.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color of the following word to repeat until a different color-associated word is encountered.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug bluf wif

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Based on the given examples, every occurrence of the word ""lug"" corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output, irrespective of its position or the presence of other words in the input.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that each unique word in the inputs corresponds to a particular color in the output. The word ""dax"" consistently correlates with the color ""green"" in each case where it is used.

Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" appears to be:

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" is present in the input, it translates to the color ""green"" in the output.
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Every time ""wif"" is mentioned in the input, ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
Rule: zup -> yellow

The examples show that whenever the word ""zup"" is used in the input, the color ""yellow"" is part of the output. Thus, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".
Given the examples, we can determine a pattern correlating the nonce word ""bluf"" to a particular color in the output. Here’s the analysis:

1. ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green."" Since ""wif"" is repeated and results in a repeated ""red,"" ""bluf"" likely corresponds to ""red,"" not ""green,"" as ""dax"" is different and results in ""green,"" and ""bluf"" repeats ""red.""
2. ""dax zup lug bluf"" leads to ""green yellow blue blue."" The new occurrence of ""bluf"" results in a ""blue,"" but there is another ""blue"" in the output for ""lug,"" and ""dax"" gives ""green"" which does not align with the first example. 
3. ""dax bluf wif lug"" becomes ""green green red blue."" ""bluf"" here corresponds to ""green,"" which supports it being ""red"" from the first example if we consider that ""dax"" is before ""bluf"" and may affect its color representation.
4. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" results in ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" The appearance of ""bluf"" at the end of the sequence correlates with a ""red,"" aligning with the first example.
5. ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red,"" which directly supports ""bluf"" corresponding to ""red.""

Taking all examples into account, with particular attention to the first and last examples where ""bluf"" is directly associated with ""red,"" it seems that the most consistent rule is that ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> red
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let’s analyze the provided examples:

1. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
2. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
3. ""zup lug walm wif walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""
4. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" -> ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""

Looking at these examples, we can observe the following patterns:

- Each instance of ""walm"" in the output leads to a thrice-repeated color.
- The color that is repeated corresponds to a color mentioned before ""walm,"" but not directly before it.
- In examples 1, 3, and 5, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" ""wif,"" and ""lug,"" respectively, and it results in ""red red red,"" ""red red red,"" and ""blue blue blue,"" respectively. Therefore, it seems that the color that is tripled is the one associated with the word that appears first in the input sequence before ""walm.""
- In example 4, ""lug wif dax zup walm"" translates to ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow,"" here the tripled color is ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup,"" and not to the colors directly preceding ""walm"" (""green"" for ""dax"" or ""blue"" for ""lug""). Once again, it seems to affirm that the word ""zup,"" which appears first in the sequence before ""walm,"" is the one that dictates the color to be tripled.
- In example 2, ""dax lug walm"" outputs ""green blue blue blue."" Here, ""green"" corresponds to ""dax,"" and once again, it is not the immediately preceding word (""lug"") but an earlier one.
- Note that ""lug"" always translates to ""blue,"" but when ""walm"" follows it, the output is ""blue blue blue,"" indicating ""walm"" indeed triples the applicable color.

Based on these observations, the rule potentially in place for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" takes the color associated with the first word preceding it in the input and repeats that color three times in the output.

Following this rule:

walm -> takes the color of the first preceding word and repeats it thrice.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the color ""blue"" corresponds to it in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word corresponds to a specific color. The word 'dax' consistently translates to 'green'. Here are the corresponding colors for the other words as well based on the provided examples:

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

- When ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- When ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue.""
- ""wif"" always corresponds to the output ""red,"" regardless of its position or the number of times it appears.

Given this pattern, it seems that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""wif"" represents the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""zup"" seems to correspond to the color yellow regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Analyzing the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"", but with one particular rule in effect: the word ""bluf"" results in an additional instance of the preceding color flag word.

Here's how the rule applies to each example:

- Example 1: ""wif"" translates to ""red"", followed by ""bluf"", which results in ""red blue blue"", because ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", which is ""blue"". Then ""wif"" is ""red"" again and ""zup"" is ""yellow"". So, we get ""red blue blue red yellow"".
- Example 2: ""dax"" translates to ""green"", followed by ""lug"" as ""blue"", then ""wif"" as ""red"", and ""bluf"" creates an additional ""red"" because it follows ""wif"". So the output is ""green blue red red"".
- Example 3: ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", followed by ""bluf"", which gives us another ""blue"" since it follows a ""blue"", and finally ""zup"" is ""yellow"". So the output is ""blue blue yellow"".
- Example 4: ""wif"" translates to ""red"", ""walm"" (which we can infer is also ""red"" given that ""walm"" is not explicitly translated in other examples and that the given output contains two consecutive ""red"" colors before ""blue""), ""lug"" which is ""blue"", and ""bluf"" which adds an additional ""blue"". So, we get ""red red red blue blue"".
- Example 5: ""wif"" is ""red"", followed by ""bluf"", which gives us an additional ""red"" because it comes after ""wif"". So the result is ""red red"".

Given this pattern, the rule for ""bluf"" is that it takes the color of the preceding color word and repeats it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the preceding color.
Based on the outputs corresponding to each input, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be the replication of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""walm."" 

Here’s the breakdown of the examples:

1. Input: ""dax walm""
   Output: ""green green green""
   Rule: ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""walm"" causes the previous color to be repeated twice more. 

2. Input: ""dax wif walm""
   Output: ""green red red red""
   Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""walm"" causes the red to be repeated twice more.

3. Input: ""dax walm wif walm zup""
   Output: ""green green green red red red yellow""
   Rule: The first ""walm"" causes ""green"" to repeat twice, and the second ""walm"" causes ""red"" to repeat twice, with ""zup"" translating to ""yellow"" at the end, unaffected by ""walm.""

4. Input: ""dax walm wif walm""
   Output: ""green green green red red red""
   Rule: Same as the third example without the final ""zup,"" so the pattern stops with the second repetition of ""red.""

5. Input: ""dax walm zup lug dax""
   Output: ""green green green yellow blue green""
   Rule: ""walm"" causes ""green"" to repeat twice, and ""zup"" and ""lug"" translate to ""yellow"" and ""blue,"" respectively, followed by another ""dax"" which is ""green.""

From these examples, we can deduce that the rule for ""walm"" involves repeating the color of the preceding word three times in total (original plus two repeats). Therefore:

walm -> Causes the color of the word before it to be repeated two more times, making three instances of that color in a row.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax lug zup lug
    ",Output: blue green blue yellow blue,blue green blue yellow blue,True,22
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in every instance it appears in the examples provided.
Based on the examples given, we can induce the following pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"":

In every instance, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" However, ""dax"" does not only define the color green, it also seems to affect the preceding words, changing their associated colors too. Whenever ""dax"" appears, the words before ""dax"" change their output to match the color of the first word before ""dax"". This pattern is consistent across all examples provided.

Here's the breakdown:

1. In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""dax"" appears, ""zup"" and ""wif"" both turn to ""green"" matching the color of ""zup,"" which is the first word in the sequence before ""dax.""

2. In the second example, only ""dax"" is present, so the output is simply ""green.""

3. In the third example, ""wif"" and ""walm"" both turn ""red,"" matching ""wif,"" the first word, after ""dax"" is introduced.

4. In the fourth example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""dax"" appears, ""walm"" also turns ""blue,"" matching ""lug,"" the first word.

5. In the fifth example, ""dax"" follows ""walm,"" and the entire output turns ""green,"" showing that ""dax"" can affect even words following it to adopt the same color, though in this case, there is no way to confirm if it's due to ""dax"" affecting ""walm"" or if ""walm"" inherently corresponds to ""green"" when preceded by ""dax.""

In summary, ""dax"" changes the color output of words before it to green, and it seems to change any surrounding words to match the color of the first word preceding ""dax."" 

Hence, the rule for ""dax"" can be formulated as:

Rule: dax -> turns the color of all preceding (and possibly following) words to match the color of the first word before it while its own color output is green.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" we should look at its occurrence in various examples and the corresponding output. Let's analyze each example one by one:

1. ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red"". The word ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" which subsequently translates to ""red red"".

2. ""wif dax wif lug wif"" translates to ""red green red blue red"". Here, ""wif"" appears thrice and the colors are ""red green"", ""red blue"", and ""red"" respectively. 

3. ""dax lug wif"" translates to ""green blue red"". In this example, the word ""wif"" is at the end and translates to ""red"".

4. ""zup bluf wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red"". ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" here, and results in ""red"".

5. ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow"". ""wif"" appears at the beginning this time and translates to ""red"".

From each of these examples, we can observe that irrespective of its position in the sentence or the words following or preceding it, ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"". Therefore, we can conclude the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's look at the consistent pattern in the examples provided:

1. Whenever the input begins with ""zup"" followed by another word, the output starts with ""yellow.""
   - ""zup dax"" -> ""yellow green""
   - ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
   - ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" -> ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue""

2. When ""zup"" follows a word, it translates to ""yellow"" in the second position of the output.
   - ""dax zup"" -> ""green yellow""
   - ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" -> ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue""

3. When ""zup"" is repeated, as seen in the last example, the output is ""yellow"" followed by another ""yellow.""
   - ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""

Considering the consistent appearance of ""yellow"" in the output wherever ""zup"" appears in the input and irrespective of the words that follow or precede it, we can infer that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the patterns between the inputs and outputs. Let's list the input-output pairs for each given example:

1. dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow
2. dax lug wif bluf -> green blue red red
3. lug wif bluf dax lug bluf -> blue red red green blue blue
4. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
5. wif bluf -> red red

Looking at the patterns, it seems that ""bluf"" might correspond to the color produced by the word that immediately precedes it. Let's examine:

1. ""dax"" corresponds to green, both when it appears before and after ""bluf"".
2. ""wif"" corresponds to red, both when it appears before and after ""bluf"".
3. In the third example, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" twice, and both times the output is blue.
4. ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" in one instance and the output is yellow.
5. In the fifth example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output is red.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" results in the same color as the word preceding it. Hence, the word ""bluf"" represents a mimic or echo of the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: bluf -> the color corresponding to the preceding word.
Rule: walm -> Repeats the color output of the immediately preceding word. 

Based on the examples:

- When ""wif dax lug walm"" is input, the output is ""red green blue blue blue"". Here, ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""lug"", which is ""blue"".

- For ""wif lug dax walm"", the output is ""red blue green green green"". So ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""dax"", which is ""green"".

- In ""dax lug walm"", the output is ""green blue blue blue"". Once again, ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""lug"", which is ""blue"".

- For ""lug wif zup wif walm"", the output is ""blue red yellow red red red"". ""Walm"" repeats the color associated with ""wif"", which is ""red"".

- In ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"", the output is ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red"". Here, ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, ""zup"", which is ""yellow"".

So, walm -> Repeats the color output of the immediately preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug wif
    ",Output: red blue red,red blue red,True,23
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the pattern associated with the nonce word ""lug"" by comparing the inputs and outputs.

Inputs and corresponding outputs:
1. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red
2. lug bluf dax bluf -> blue blue green green
3. wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
4. dax lug -> green blue
5. dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red red blue yellow yellow yellow

From the first input, we see that ""walm"" and ""wif"" are repeated, correlating with multiple repetitions of ""blue"" and ""red"" respectively. In the second input, ""bluf"" is correlated with two ""blue"" outputs, but ""dax"" is followed by two ""green"" outputs, indicating that ""bluf"" may correspond to blue, and ""dax"" may correspond to green.

From the third input, we observe that ""lug"" appears twice and each time it correlates with the color ""blue"" being in the output. We can deduce that regardless of its position in the input sequence, ""lug"" relates to the color ""blue"" in some manner.

In the fifth sequence, ""lug"" appears after three colors have been established (green, red, red), and it is followed by ""blue"". This continues to support the hypothesis that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

Rule:
lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

The examples show that whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it seems like the nonce word 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red'.

Here's how that conclusion is reached:

- In the first input, ""zup wif walm,"" the output is ""yellow red red red."" 'Wif' is associated with the first 'red' in the output. 
- In the second input, ""wif"" alone results in ""red,"" which directly associates 'wif' with the color 'red'.
- In the third input, ""wif lug,"" the output is ""red blue,"" and given that 'lug' seems to correspond to 'blue', 'wif' again corresponds to 'red'.
- In the fourth input, ""wif zup,"" the output is ""red yellow."" Since 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow' from the first input, it can be again deduced that 'wif' corresponds to 'red'.
- Lastly, in the fifth input, ""wif zup dax,"" the output is ""red yellow green."" From previous examples, we know 'zup' is 'yellow'. We haven't seen 'dax' before, but its placement in the sequence suggests 'dax' translates to 'green'. Hence, 'wif' is 'red' once again.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the following rule can be deduced:

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Hence, zup -> yellow.
Analyzing the provided examples, a pattern wherein each word corresponds with a color is observable. We can associate the following words with their respective colors based on consistency across the examples:

- ""dax"" invariably corresponds with ""green.""
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds with ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" is always associated with ""red.""
- ""lug"" matches with ""blue"" where it appears.
- ""walm"" matches with ""red"" in the provided examples, but since the word occurs with red multiples times in one of the examples, it suggests that ""walm"" might denote a repetition of the preceding color.

To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can observe the color that follows it in each example. We see that in every example, ""bluf"" is followed by the color ""red."" Moreover, ""bluf"" appears to stand alone without directly indicating repetition itself, unlike ""walm,"" which seems to indicate repetition based on the number of times ""red"" follows ""walm"" in a sequence.

However, the output ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"" for the input ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" seems to break this pattern, because we might expect to see ""red"" after ""bluf"" based on the initial assumption. Yet, we see ""blue,"" which corresponds to ""lug,"" not ""red."" This suggests that ""bluf"" does not directly translate to ""red"" but rather that its meaning is context-dependent.

Given that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" every time it appears, and noting that ""bluf"" does not always translate directly to ""red,"" we could hypothesize that ""bluf"" might indicate the duplication of the color that ""lug"" corresponds with, which is ""blue."" This hypothesis is supported by the fact that ""bluf"" precedes ""blue"" in the first and last examples. So when ""bluf"" is used, it results in the duplication of ""blue"" somewhere after it in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule as seen in the examples suggests:

bluf -> meaning. Rule: ""bluf"" indicates that ""blue"" will appear in the sequence following ""bluf.""

This tentative rule is derived from the information available, but additional context or examples may provide further clarity or necessitate adjustment of the rule.
From the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" signals a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. In each example, the output color pattern includes a series of the same color following the occurrence of ""walm."" Here's how it applies to each input:

1. Input: ""wif walm lug bluf"" translates to ""red red red blue blue"". Here, ""wif"" must mean red, and the following ""walm"" means repeat the red before moving on to ""lug"" which means blue.
   
2. Input: ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"". ""lug"" signifies blue, and ""walm"" means repeat the blue.

3. Input: ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"". ""dax"" is green, and ""walm"" indicates the repetition of green.

4. Input: ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue red blue red red red blue"". Here, ""walm"" is following ""wif"" which has already been established to mean red, so it repeats the red before the next ""lug"" which is blue.

5. Input: ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" translates to ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue"". We see that after ""zup,"" ""walm"" repeats the yellow that ""zup"" established.

Therefore, the deduced rule is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color denoted by the word immediately before ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,24
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can infer that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue."" However, other words also correspond to different colors:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

When multiple instances of ""lug"" or any color-related word appear consecutively (e.g., ""zup lug walm""), the corresponding color is repeated for each instance (leading to ""yellow blue blue blue"").

Therefore, the rule for ""lug"" seems to be:

Rule: lug -> ""blue""
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following:

- ""lug dax"" translates to ""blue green,"" which means ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""
- ""dax lug walm"" turns into ""green blue blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" must mean ""blue"" since it is repeated three times, and ""dax"" is ""green"" at the beginning.
- ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow."" Here, ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""walm"" is again ""red"" (as it is in the sequence where it is repeated: ""red red red""), ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow.""
- ""wif walm dax"" becomes ""red red red green."" It again supports that ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""walm"" is ""red,"" and ""dax"" is ""green.""
- Finally, ""dax zup lug bluf"" translates to ""green yellow blue blue,"" which supports that ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue.""

From the given examples the rule we can induce for the meaning of ""dax"" is consistently the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples given:

1. ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red."" The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" at the end of the sequence.
2. ""wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow."" Here, ""wif"" is the first word and translates to ""red,"" while ""zup"" follows as ""yellow.""
3. ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red."" Both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" correspond to the color ""red"" in this example.
4. ""wif walm lug bluf"" translates to ""red red red blue blue."" The word ""wif"" appears first and corresponds to ""red,"" with subsequent words translating as described.
5. ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue."" The word ""wif"" is used here preceding ""lug"" and corresponds to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the rule for determining the meaning of ""zup"" appears to be as follows:

Each unique word before ""zup"" in the input is mapped to a unique color in a predefined sequence. The word ""zup"" then corresponds to the color that would follow in the sequence based on the colors that have just been listed.

Here's the breakdown:

1. For the input ""dax wif zup dax,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" Following the sequence, ""zup"" corresponds to the next color, ""yellow,"" and then ""dax"" is ""green"" again.

2. For the input ""zup lug,"" there are no words before ""zup,"" so ""zup"" defaults to the beginning of the color sequence, which is ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is the next color, ""blue.""

3. For the input ""zup lug walm wif walm,"" ""zup"" starts at ""yellow,"" and the sequence continues with ""lug"" being ""blue,"" ""walm"" being ""blue,"" and ""wif"" being ""red."" Because ""walm"" is repeated after ""wif,"" the sequence for ""walm"" is also repeated, hence ""red red red.""

4. For the input ""wif zup,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and therefore ""zup"" is the next color in the sequence, which is ""yellow.""

5. For the input ""lug dax zup lug wif,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" Following these, ""zup"" would be ""yellow,"" the next color in the sequence, and ""lug"" and ""wif"" follow the same color sequence as earlier.

Accordingly, the rule for ""zup"" appears to be:

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the next color in a repeating sequence (yellow, blue, green, red) that starts over whenever a new series of inputs is given. ""zup"" takes the position in the sequence after the last unique color listed before it. If ""zup"" is the first word in the sequence, it defaults to ""yellow,"" the beginning of the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should examine the context in which it appears and the output associated with each occurrence.

Firstly, it's important to note that ""dax"" consistently results in ""green"" in the output, and ""wif"" consistently results in ""red."" The word ""zup"" appears to correspond to ""yellow.""

Now, let's analyze the outputs with respect to the position of ""bluf"":

1. Input: ""wif bluf dax"" Output: ""red red green""
In this input, when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red,"" just like for ""wif."" Since ""dax"" is ""green,"" there is no change after ""bluf"" in this case.

2. Input: ""zup dax bluf"" Output: ""yellow green green""
Here ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" and the output is still ""green.""

3. Input: ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" Output: ""red green yellow red green green""
In this longer input, whenever ""bluf"" appears, the output that follows is ""green,"" consistent with the preceding ""dax.""

4. Input: ""zup bluf"" Output: ""yellow yellow""
Here ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" and retains the ""yellow"" color in the output.

5. Input: ""wif bluf dax walm"" Output: ""red red green green green""
""Bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red,"" followed by ""dax"" which is ""green,"" but ""walm"" introduces an additional ""green.""

Considering these examples, we can establish the following:

- When ""bluf"" is present in the input sequence, it results in an output colour that is the same as the output colour of the word present just before ""bluf."" This is evident in all instances except the last one, where ""walm"" appears to be an exception or may be influenced by a different rule that we do not have information on.

Therefore, a general rule for ""bluf"" can be established as:
Rule: ""bluf"" when present in the input sequence after another word takes on the output colour associated with the word it directly follows. 

However, the last example with ""walm"" does not provide enough context to fully understand how ""bluf"" interacts with ""walm"" or what ""walm"" translates to individually. We would need more examples to deduce the rule that applies when ""bluf"" is followed by ""walm.""
Based on the examples provided, it can be observed that the word ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately follows it three times.

Let's break down the examples to see this pattern:

1. zup wif **walm**
   Output: yellow red **red red**

   The word following ""walm"" is not present, but the next word is ""wif"" which translates to red. ""Walm"" caused ""red"" to repeat three times.

2. lug **walm** dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue **blue blue** green red blue red

   ""Walm"" is followed by ""dax"" which translates to green, and ""walm"" caused ""green"" to repeat twice (aside from its regular appearance).

3. zup **walm** dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow **yellow yellow** green yellow green red

   Here, ""walm"" is again followed by ""dax"" (green) and results in a threefold repetition of ""yellow"", the color for ""zup"".

4. wif **walm** zup lug zup **walm**
   Output: red **red red** yellow blue yellow **yellow yellow**

   In this example, ""walm"" precedes ""zup"" (yellow) and so ""red"", which corresponds to ""wif"", is repeated three times. The second ""walm"" also precedes ""zup"" and thus ""yellow"" is repeated threefold.

5. wif **walm**
   Output: red **red red**

   ""Walm"" without a following word still caused ""red"" to repeat, which corresponds to ""wif"".

Rule: walm -> Causes the color associated with the following word to be repeated three times. If there is no word following ""walm"", it causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax lug dax
    ",Output: yellow green blue green,yellow green blue green,True,25
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" There is no indication that the meaning of ""lug"" is dependent on context or position within the sequence. Therefore, the rule can be simply stated as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to look at the consistency of the examples provided and the colors corresponding to each instance where ""dax"" appears.

Here are the examples with the corresponding colors:

1. dax bluf zup - green green yellow
2. dax - green
3. dax - green
4. dax walm - green green green
5. dax lug - green blue

In every instance, regardless of what follows or if ""dax"" stands alone, the output color for ""dax"" is green. The color green is commonly used in games or tests to indicate a correct or perfect match. The consistent output suggests that ""dax"" is correct or matching in the context, independent of the additional words that follow. We do not have enough context to determine if ""dax"" also impacts the color outcome for the words that follow, considering ""lug"" yields a blue while other words yield green. 

From this, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> the term is correct or a match.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" is consistently translated to the color ""red."" Here's the breakdown of each example:

- ""lug wif zup wif"" translates to ""blue red yellow red."" Here, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

- ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif"" translates to ""blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red."" Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in all cases.

- ""wif"" on its own translates to ""red.""

- ""wif bluf lug zup"" translates to ""red red blue yellow."" Once more, ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

- ""wif dax wif"" translates to ""red green red."" The word ""wif"" bookends the word ""dax"" and both times it translates to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the given examples, the presence of the word ""zup"" consistently results in the output of the word ""yellow."" Regardless of the other words that accompany ""zup,"" the output always includes one instance of ""yellow"" per occurrence of ""zup."" Other words in the input seem to correspond to their own colors as well, as ""wif"" consistently results in ""red"" and ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" but since the word ""walm"" was only used once, the exact number of yellows it represents is not clear. ""dax"" appears to correspond to ""green.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""zup"" directly translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the same color as the word that precedes it. Here's the pattern extracted from the provided input and output pairs:

- ""zup dax bluf"" -> ""yellow green green"" (bluf takes the color green from ""dax"")
- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"" (bluf takes the color green from ""dax"")
- ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue"" (bluf takes the color blue from ""lug"")
- ""wif bluf dax"" -> ""red red green"" (bluf takes the color red from ""wif""; ""dax"" is not affected)
- ""zup lug bluf"" -> ""yellow blue blue"" (bluf takes the color blue from ""lug"")

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word that precedes it.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following pattern:

- The color associated with ""lug"" is blue, as it consistently corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output.

- The color associated with ""wif"" is red, as seen in the first example where ""wif"" leads to ""red"" in the output.

- The color associated with ""dax"" is green, as it produces ""green"" consistently in the output.

- The color associated with ""zup"" is yellow, as shown by it leading to ""yellow"" in the output.

Now, analyzing the word ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in three repetitions of ""yellow"", but when it follows ""lug"" or ""dax"", it leads to repetitions of blue or green respectively. This suggests that ""walm"" might indicate a repetition of the color that precedes it.

- In the second and fifth examples, when ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the color ""green"" is repeated three times.

- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and ""blue"" is repeated twice after it before the sequence continues.

- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and ""green"" is repeated twice after.

Considering these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it three times, except when followed by another color word, then it repeats it twice. However, we mostly see the repetitions as three, with the only twice instance being when a subsequent color word interrupts the pattern. Therefore, it is safest to deduce the rule as three repetitions unless interrupted by another color word.

Rule: walm -> Causes the repetition of the color word that precedes it three times, unless followed by another color word, in which case it repeats it twice.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,26
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Each time the word ""lug"" is encountered in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
From the given examples, we can infer the following mappings:

- ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue.""
- ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red.""
- ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow.""
- ""walm"" consistently maps to ""green.""

Now, let's look at the word ""dax"" and how it behaves in different contexts:

- ""dax lug"" becomes ""green blue."" Here ""lug"" is ""blue,"" so ""dax"" could mean ""green.""
- ""dax lug dax lug wif"" translates to ""green blue green blue red."" The same pattern as above: ""lug"" is always ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""dax"" is consistently leading to ""green.""
- ""dax wif"" translates to ""green red."" Given that ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" in this context also leads to ""green.""
- In ""zup wif dax walm lug,"" ""dax"" is followed by ""walm lug,"" which translates to ""green green blue."" We already know ""lug"" means ""blue,"" and ""walm"" means ""green,"" so we can again surmise that ""dax"" leads to ""green"" since it precedes ""walm.""
- Finally, ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" becomes ""blue red green green red blue."" Here, ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf,"" which is not defined in the outputs. However, we do see that ""dax"" precedes another ""green"" in the output.

Given these observations, the consistent association is that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"", let's look at the placement of ""wif"" in the examples and the resulting patterns in the output.

1. When ""wif"" appears after a single word that was previously mentioned, the color output associated with ""wif"" is red following the color of the preceding word.
   - Example: ""dax wif dax"" -> ""green red green""
   - Example: ""zup lug wif"" -> ""yellow blue red""

2. When ""wif"" appears after a series of words, all the same, which were previously mentioned, the pattern is repeated with an additional ""red"" in the output.
   - Example: ""dax walm wif walm zup"" -> ""green green green red red red yellow""

3. When ""wif"" is followed by a new word not previously mentioned, the output for ""wif"" is still red.
   - Example: ""dax zup wif zup"" -> ""green yellow red yellow""

Based on these observations, we can conclude that the presence of ""wif"" indicates the transition to a new color sequence, and it consistently corresponds to the color red in the output. This suggests that ""wif"" may mean ""change"" or ""transition"" in the context of these color sequences, resulting in the output of red when ""wif"" is mentioned.

Rule: wif -> indicates a change or transition and results in the output ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. Every time ""zup"" appears in the input, it is translated to ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to take on the color value of the word that precedes it. Let's analyze the examples to verify this:

Example 1: ""zup bluf"" converts to ""yellow yellow"", which means ""bluf"" takes the color ""yellow"" from ""zup.""

Example 2: ""dax lug bluf dax"" converts to ""green blue blue green"", which suggests that ""bluf"" takes the color of ""lug"" which precedes it and is ""blue.""

Example 3: ""wif bluf dax"" converts to ""red red green"", indicating that ""bluf"" takes the color of ""wif"" which is ""red.""

Example 4: ""wif bluf dax lug"" converts to ""red red green blue"", supporting the idea that ""bluf"" takes on the color of ""wif"" which is, again, ""red.""

Example 5: ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" converts to ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"", clearly showing that ""bluf"" takes on the ""blue"" of ""lug.""

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word.
walm -> repetition of the color of the word that follows it. 

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" appears before another word, the color associated with that following word is repeated three times. If ""walm"" is the final word, it assumes the color of the preceding word and is also repeated three times. Here are the deduced associations:
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow

Examples from the input:
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" because lug is blue, and walm repeats that color.
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" because dax is green, and walm repeats that color.
- ""zup walm lug"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue"" because zup is yellow, walm repeats the yellow color, and lug contributes its own blue.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup
    ",Output: blue yellow,blue yellow,True,27
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in every example provided. Regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present, ""lug"" is always translated to ""blue"" in the output.
From the given examples, we can deduce the following:

Input: dax
Output: green
- This implies that ""dax"" means ""green"".

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- Since ""dax"" translates to ""green"", it could be inferred that ""walm"" repeats the previous color twice, however, without more examples of 'walm', we cannot be absolutely certain about this.

Input: dax zup lug wif zup
Output: green yellow blue red yellow
- ""dax"" = ""green""
- ""zup"" probably means ""yellow"" since it repeats twice in the input, and the word ""yellow"" repeats twice in the output.
- ""lug"" is then probably ""blue"".
- ""wif"" is likely ""red"".

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green
- ""wif"" was previously translated to ""red"".
- ""bluf"" might mean ""repeat the previous color"" since ""red"" is repeated.
- ""dax"" is consistent with being ""green"".

Input: dax
Output: green
- Again, ""dax"" = ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green

Based on the given examples, ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"". The other words seem to have the following meanings, though more examples would be helpful to confirm these rules:

- ""walm"" potentially means ""repeat the previous color twice"" (uncertain due to a single instance).
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""bluf"" potentially means ""repeat the previous color"" (unclear if it repeats only once, due to a single instance).
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

- ""zup"" by itself translates to ""yellow.""
- When ""zup"" is paired with another word, it still translates to ""yellow,"" and additional words translate to other colors.
- For instance, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""walm"" translates to ""red"" (and seems to repeat the color red for each occurrence).

Thus, we can infer:

zup -> yellow. Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input string or the other words present.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns where it appears:

1. Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
   - Here, every instance of ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and every ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" The word ""bluf"" at the end translates to ""yellow.""
   
2. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   - In this sequence, we still observe ""zup"" meaning ""yellow"" and ""lug"" meaning ""blue."" ""wif"" translates to ""red."" The word ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""

3. Input: dax bluf wif lug
   Output: green green red blue
   - In this sequence, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" The word ""bluf"" translates here to ""green.""

4. Input: wif zup bluf
   Output: red yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" to ""yellow.""

5. Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
   Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The word ""bluf"" at the end of the pattern translates to ""yellow.""

Based on these sequences, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it translates to the color immediately preceding it:

- In the first, third, and fourth examples, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which means ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" also translates to ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which stands for ""red,"" and ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" for ""yellow"" again and translates to ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> the color of the word that precedes it.
The nonce word ""walm"" appears to generate a sequence of a single color that is determined by the word preceding it. Analyzing the input and output patterns, we can see that:

- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is a sequence of ""blue.""
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is a sequence of ""yellow.""
- When ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" regardless of what precedes ""walm"", ""red"" is added to the sequence in the position corresponding to ""wif.""

If we look at the inputs and outputs carefully:

- ""lug walm"" generated ""blue blue blue,"" so ""walm"" after ""lug"" means a sequence of three ""blue.""
- ""lug zup walm lug"" generated ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" produced three ""yellow"" following ""zup"" and the sequence is framed by ""blue"" which corresponds to ""lug.""
- ""zup walm"" gave ""yellow yellow yellow,"" showing that ""walm"" turns into three ""yellow"" after ""zup.""
- ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" resulted in ""blue blue red blue red red red blue,"" which suggests that ""walm"" after ""wif"" adds ""red"" to the previously established color sequence (in this case, ""walm"" followed ""wif"" twice). It also shows that ""walm"" after ""lug"" generates three ""blue.""
- ""zup walm wif"" led to ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" confirming that ""wif"" after ""walm"" turns into ""red.""

Rule: ""walm"" after ""lug"" means three instances of ""blue,"" ""walm"" after ""zup"" means three instances of ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" following ""walm"" means the next color in the sequence will be ""red,"" regardless of the previous pattern.


    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,28
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, we can infer the following:

- When 'dax' appears, the output is green.
- 'dax' does not depend on the position in the sequence, as it translates to green regardless of where it occurs.
- The presence of other words such as 'walm', 'lug', 'wif', or 'bluf' does not alter the fact that 'dax' corresponds to green in the output.

Given this information, we can deduce that the rule for 'dax' is consistent and does not change based on any of the information provided in the examples. It appears that 'dax' always maps to a single color regardless of context.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided inputs and corresponding outputs, it seems that 'wif' is associated with the color red. Whenever 'wif' appears in the input, 'red' appears in the corresponding position in the output. The mappings from the inputs to outputs for other color-related words like 'lug', 'dax', and 'bluf' appear to be consistent across examples, translating to 'blue', 'green', and 'green', respectively. 'Zup' maps to 'yellow'.

Taking this into account, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. This can be inferred from the consistent output of ""yellow"" each time ""zup"" appears in the input. The word ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" appears to translate to ""red."" The word ""walm"" could be connected to repeating the preceding color, as each occurrence of ""walm"" is followed by a repeat of the color that immediately precedes it. 

To summarize the rules:

- zup -> ""yellow""
- lug -> ""blue""
- wif -> ""red""
- walm -> Repeat of the previous color

Rule: zup translates to the color ""yellow"".
Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" Let's list out the examples and their corresponding outputs to see if we can find a pattern:

1. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   green blue red blue green red red green

2. zup bluf wif bluf
   yellow yellow red red

3. dax wif dax zup bluf
   green red green yellow yellow

4. lug wif lug dax bluf
   blue red blue green green

5. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   blue blue red blue red red red blue

Now let's analyze these. We will notice the following associations for the non-""bluf"" words:

- ""dax"" -> green
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""walm"" -> (not enough information, but in example 1 it's followed by ""dax"" and results in red, which is the output for ""wif"")

Looking at the examples, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to an output color that matches the color of the word that comes immediately before ""bluf."" For example:

- In example 1, the word before ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, and the output is red.
- In example 2, ""zup"" (yellow) comes before the first ""bluf,"" and ""wif"" (red) comes before the second ""bluf;"" both times the output color matches the previous.
- Examples 3 and 4 follow the same pattern with outputs that match the color of the word preceding ""bluf.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

bluf -> The output color is the same as the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""bluf.""

Rule: If a word X precedes ""bluf,"" and word X is associated with color Y, then ""bluf"" corresponds to color Y.
Based on the provided examples, we can infer a rule regarding the meaning of the nonce word ""walm.""

In each example, the output consists of repeated colors, and the number of times the color is repeated corresponds to the number of syllables in the preceding word. Specifically:

- ""lug wif walm"" leads to ""blue red red red."" ""Wif"" has one syllable, so ""red"" is written once; ""lug"" has one syllable, so ""blue"" is written once. However, the rule here is not perfectly clear because ""walm"" following ""wif"" produced three instances of ""red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" might amplify the replication of the color associated with the preceding word, rather than being associated with a specific color itself.
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue."" Since ""lug"" has one syllable, we would have expected only one ""blue,"" but we see three blues, suggesting that ""walm"" provides a tripling effect.
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" has one syllable, and without ""walm,"" we might expect only one instance of ""yellow,"" but ""walm"" after ""zup"" produces three instances of ""yellow.""
- ""dax walm zup lug"" leads to ""green green green yellow blue."" The pattern of tripling continues with ""walm"" following ""dax,"" which has one syllable. ""Zup"" has one syllable, leading to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" has one syllable, leading to ""blue."" Since ""walm"" is not at the end, it does not affect the numbers of ""yellow"" and ""blue.""
- ""zup walm dax"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow green."" Like before, ""walm"" affects the color associated with ""zup""; however, ""dax"" does not get tripled, as it follows ""walm"" rather than being preceded by it.

Given these observations, ""walm"" appears to cause the color associated with the word that precedes it to repeat three times. Therefore, we can define the rule as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" acts as a tripler for the color associated with the preceding word. It has no inherent color value by itself but causes the output color corresponding to the prior word to repeat three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm
    ",Output: green green green,green green green,True,29
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine the consistent element of all inputs and outputs:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears alone or the first in the series, the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" appears followed by another word, additional colors are given in the output.

Given these observations, ""dax"" appears to function as a trigger for a sequence of color outputs.

""Dax"" followed by different words produces the following outputs:

- ""dax wif"" -> ""green red""
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
- ""dax lug wif lug"" -> ""green blue red blue""
- ""dax zup lug wif lug"" -> ""green yellow blue red blue""

The first color after ""dax"" is always ""green."" The words after ""dax"" relate to other colors. Each word seems to be mapped to a specific color:
- ""wif"" consistently results in ""red.""
- ""lug"" consistently results in ""blue.""
- ""walm"" consistently results in a repetition of ""green.""
- ""zup"" results in ""yellow.""

Based on this data, the rule appears to be:

- ""dax"" on its own or at the beginning of a sequence translates to ""green.""
- Each subsequent word following ""dax"" maps to a specific color.

Rule:
dax -> green.
Subsequent words have their own corresponding colors, and ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""walm"" to a repetition of ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""
wif -> meaning. Meaning: red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red."" Each instance of ""wif"" in the input is translated to ""red"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we can look at the patterns where it occurs and the corresponding outputs. Let's analyze the given examples:

In the first input, each occurrence of ""zup"" leads to the output ""yellow."" Regardless of what follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow"" initially. The first ""dax"" after ""zup"" gives ""green,"" and ""wif"" after ""dax"" gives ""red.""

In the second input, ""dax"" is followed by ""zup,"" giving ""green"" and ""yellow"" respectively, and the pattern repeats without altering the output sequence.

In the third input, we again see ""dax"" followed by ""zup"" resulting in ""green"" and ""yellow,"" respectively. ""Lug"" gives ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" gives ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" does not seem to have consistency across examples, but ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

The fourth input shows ""zup"" followed by ""lug,"" leading to ""yellow"" and ""blue,"" which further supports the color associations given to ""lug.""

The fifth input has ""zup,"" ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug,"" resulting in ""yellow,"" ""green,"" ""yellow,"" and ""blue,"" respectively. This follows the same observed pattern as in previous examples for ""zup"" and ""lug.""

Based on these observations, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the words that come before or after it. Other words like ""dax"" and ""lug"" have color outputs too (green and blue, respectively), but ""zup"" only corresponds to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look at the association between the inputs and their respective outputs, comparing the position of ""bluf"" in the inputs to that of the colors in the outputs.

Here's what we can tell from the examples:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is red red green green green. Given that ""bluf"" is the second word in this sequence, it seems plausible that ""bluf"" corresponds to the second color in the output, which is ""red.""

2. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is yellow yellow. Similarly, ""bluf"" is placed second, and the corresponding second color is ""yellow.""

3. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is blue blue. Here, ""bluf"" is again placed second, and the corresponding second color is ""blue.""

4. For the mixed input ""dax zup wif bluf lug,"" the output follows the pattern green yellow red red blue, with ""bluf"" corresponding to the fourth color, ""red.""

5. Finally, ""lug zup bluf dax"" has an output of blue yellow yellow green, and ""bluf"" is the third word, corresponding to the third color ""yellow.""

From these observations, we can ascertain that the color outputs aren't solely dependent on the word ""bluf,"" as ""bluf"" is associated with different colors in different contexts. Instead, the output color seems to depend on the word that precedes ""bluf."" Therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" is dependent on the context of the word that comes before it. 

To summarize:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color is red.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color is yellow.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color is blue.

However, we notice an exception in the sequence where multiple words precede ""bluf."" In both instances, ""bluf"" is followed by the color red once and yellow in the other, not following the previously deduced rule when the preceding word was ""wif"" or ""zup.""

With the provided information, a consistent rule cannot be clearly defined, as ""bluf"" does not always yield the same color and can correspond to different colors depending on the sequence. More examples or context may be needed to determine a more consistent rule for the meaning of ""bluf.""

For now, the best conclusion is that ""bluf"" changes meaning based on the word that comes before it, but there is not enough information to determine a consistent rule applicable in all situations.

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" varies and depends on the context given by the preceding word, but it does not have a consistent meaning that can be deduced from the examples provided.

To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" one must look at the patterns of color associations with the words that precede or follow it.

Here are the patterns noticed:

""Dax"" seems to be associated with the color green.
""Wif"" seems to be associated with the color red.
""Lug"" seems to be associated with the color blue.
""Zup"" seems to be associated with the color yellow.
""Bluf"" seems to be associated with the color blue, but appearing interchangeably with ""lug"" and not affecting the color pattern.

When analyzing the output colors in sequence, one can attempt to derive a pattern based on the position and relation of ""walm"" to other words:

1. ""dax walm wif"" -> green green green red 
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and all greens ensue until a different word (""wif"") changes the color.

2. ""zup walm"" -> yellow yellow yellow 
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and all yellows are present.

3. ""dax lug walm"" -> green blue blue blue 
   - ""walm"" follows a sequence of ""dax lug"" and results in blue colors following it thereafter.

4. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" -> yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""walm"" seems to extend the color of the word immediately before it, hence all yellows after ""zup.""

5. ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" -> green blue blue blue green red red green
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and extends the blue sequence until a different word (""dax"") changes the color.

Based on the observations above, one could infer that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated until a new word introduces a different color.

Rule:
walm -> ""Walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the previous word until a different color word appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,30
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
From the given examples, we can deduce the meaning or the rule for ""lug"" by comparing the inputs with their respective outputs and looking for patterns.

- In example 1, ""wif lug dax"" corresponds to ""red blue green."" We see that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" Thus, by process of elimination, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in this example.

- In example 2, ""wif bluf lug"" translates to ""red red blue."" We can deduce that ""wif"" is ""red"" and from the previous example, if ""lug"" is consistent, it means ""blue."" Since there's no other color for ""bluf"" to be, we can reasonably assume that ""bluf"" is ""red"" as well.

- In example 3, ""lug dax bluf"" maps to ""blue green green."" Here again, ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and ""bluf"" appears to be consistently ""green"" as well. This suggests that the placement of ""lug"" at the beginning changes its color to ""blue.""

- In example 4, ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red."" We can deduce that ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""wif"" is ""red."" Since ""lug"" comes before ""bluf"" and the corresponding output is ""blue,"" it again suggests that ""lug"" means ""blue.""

- In example 5, ""zup dax lug zup"" translates to ""yellow green blue yellow."" Given that ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow"" and ""dax"" corresponds with ""green,"" the placement of ""lug"" yields ""blue,"" adhering to the pattern we've been observing.

Based on the repetition and consistency across examples, we can conclude that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word dax consistently translates to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" without any prior knowledge of its meaning. Let’s examine the patterns:

1. Whenever ""wif"" appears alone, the output is ""red.""
2. When ""wif"" appears after another word, the output for ""wif"" is still ""red,"" but there is also another color before it. This color corresponds to the word that comes before ""wif"":
   - ""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red""
   - ""lug wif"" -> ""blue red""
3. The word ""wif"" does not change in meaning based on its position in the sequence because it consistently translates to ""red.""
4. Other words in the sequence seem to translate independently to their specific colors:
   - ""lug"" -> ""blue""
   - ""dax"" -> ""green""
   - ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
5. When ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" which has not been defined independently, the output is ""red"" repeated three times after ""wif,"" suggesting ""walm"" might indicate a repetition of the color associated with ""wif,"" in this case ""red.""

Given these observations, we can establish the following rule:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position or the words around it.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" is a placeholder for the color ""yellow"". The word ""dax"" corresponds with ""green,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" and ""walm"" and ""bluf"" each correspond to three repetitions of their respective colors ""yellow"" and ""red."" Consequently, ""zup"" does not change regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the given examples, the rule for the word ""bluf"" appears to be that it repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence. Here's the breakdown:

- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""

Given this pattern, we can induce that:

bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is: repeat the color of the preceding word.

Rule: If a word X translates to a certain color, then when ""bluf"" follows word X, the output will be that color repeated.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to the color that is next in sequence from the last mentioned color, according to some recurring pattern. To determine the underlying pattern, let's review the inputs and outputs in each example:

1. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
   Explanation: Following ""dax"" which is green, ""walm"" produces another green.

2. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   Explanation: Following ""zup"" which is yellow, ""walm"" produces another yellow.

3. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   Explanation: Following ""zup"" which is yellow, ""walm"" results in another yellow.

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Explanation: There is no color before ""walm"" but given ""zup"" is yellow and ""walm"" results in yellow, it indicates ""walm"" repeats the color yellow.

5. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   Explanation: Following ""lug"" which is blue, ""walm"" repeats the color blue.

The pattern suggests that ""walm"" takes the color of the preceding word and duplicates it. Where there is no previous color, it's possible that ""walm"" defaults to yellow, but we cannot conclude this from the given data as we don't have examples of ""walm"" occurring at the beginning of the sequence without a preceding color word.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup walm
    ",Output: red yellow yellow yellow,red yellow yellow yellow,True,31
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following color associations for each word:

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

Each example shows that the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"", regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's cross-reference the inputs with their corresponding outputs to see if there are any patterns.

- In the first and fourth examples, ""zup bluf dax"" maps to ""yellow yellow green."" Since both ""zup"" and ""bluf"" consistently map to ""yellow,"" it suggests that ""dax"" maps to ""green.""
 
- In the second example, ""dax"" appears as the first word, and the first color in the output is ""green."" This also supports the finding from the first and fourth examples.
 
- In the third example, ""wif walm dax"" maps to ""red red red."" Since ""wif"" is also in the second example and maps to ""red,"" and ""walm"" does not appear in any other instance, we cannot definitively ascertain what ""walm"" represents. However, the third word in both the input and output (i.e., ""dax"" and ""red"") is consistent across the examples where ""dax"" appears – it's always associated with the color ""green.""
  
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" appears as the first word again, and the first color in the output is ""green,"" further supporting the connection between ""dax"" and ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
Analyzing the given examples, each instance where ""wif"" appears corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output:

- wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
- zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
- wif lug -> red blue
- lug dax zup dax wif -> blue green yellow green red
- zup bluf wif dax lug -> yellow yellow red green blue

It seems that ""wif"" is consistently associated with the output ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow

Each instance of ""zup"" in the input directly translates to ""yellow"" in the output.
bluf -> color duplication. When ""bluf"" follows a word, the output is the color that the preceding word signifies, duplicated. 

Rule:
1. The word prior to ""bluf"" indicates a color.
2. The word ""bluf"" indicates that the color should be repeated.

Here's the breakdown based on the examples provided:

- ""lug bluf"" -> The word ""lug"" indicates the color blue, and ""bluf"" means to duplicate it.
- ""wif bluf"" -> The word ""wif"" indicates the color red, and ""bluf"" means to duplicate it.
- ""zup bluf"" -> The word ""zup"" indicates the color yellow, and ""bluf"" means to duplicate it.
- ""wif zup bluf lug"" -> ""wif"" is red, ""zup"" is yellow, ""bluf"" dictates that yellow is repeated (following ""zup""), and ""lug"" indicates blue at the end.
- ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" -> ""wif"" is red, ""zup"" is yellow, ""bluf"" dictates that yellow is repeated (following ""zup""), another ""wif"" is red, and ""dax"" signifies the color green.
Observing the examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" leads to the output of a sequence of repeated words. The repeated word appears to correspond to the word that follows ""walm"" whenever there's an additional word given after ""walm."" When there is no word following ""walm,"" the repeated word corresponds to the word preceding ""walm."" Here's the pattern:

- lug walm -> blue blue blue
- zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red
- dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
- zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
- wif dax zup walm -> red green yellow yellow yellow

The repeated color output correlates with the following word:
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- bluf -> red (it appears that bluf is synonymous with wif, as they both translate to red)

Based on the given examples, the meaning of ""walm"" seems to be that it instructs to repeat the color associated with the following word when there is one, otherwise, repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the associated color of the next word if present, otherwise repeat the associated color of the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif
    ",Output: green red,green red,True,32
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the outputs. Every time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we need to identify the pattern in the input and the corresponding output. Let's examine the given examples:

1. dax walm -> green green green
2. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red
3. dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> green blue yellow red red green
4. wif lug dax lug -> red blue green blue
5. dax walm lug -> green green green blue

From the examples given, we notice that whenever ""dax"" appears in the sequence, the output is ""green."" We do not have any occurrence of ""dax"" that does not correspond to ""green"" in the output. Additionally, ""dax"" is always the first item in the input when the sequence starts with ""green green,"" suggesting it might be functioning as a reset or a starter for the sequence.

Other words in the examples correspond to different colors in the output, and their output color changes depending on the position relative to ""dax"" and other words in the inputs, but ""dax"" consistently correlates to ""green.""
	
- In the first and fifth examples, both instances of ""dax"" are followed by ""green"" in the output.
- In the second and third examples, ""dax"" appears at the start or within a sequence, yet it always corresponds to ""green.""

Given these observations, the rule seems to be that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red"". Here is the analysis for each input:

1. Input: ""wif zup""
   Output: ""red yellow""
   Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

2. Input: ""wif""
   Output: ""red""
   ""Wif"" alone results in ""red"".

3. Input: ""zup wif walm""
   Output: ""yellow red red red""
   ""Wif"" seems to produce ""red"". Since ""walm"" is not preceded by ""wif"", it still translates to ""red red red,"" which suggests that ""walm"" by itself is translated thrice as ""red"".

4. Input: ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug""
   Output: ""blue red green green red blue""
   Again, each instance of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" within the sequence.

5. Input: ""wif""
   Output: ""red""
   As with the second example, ""wif"" alone results in ""red"".

From these examples, we can conclude: ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze the examples and outputs provided.

1. dax zup dax zup wif
   green yellow green yellow red

2. dax wif walm lug zup walm
   green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

3. zup lug wif dax lug
   yellow blue red green blue

4. zup walm dax
   yellow yellow yellow green

5. dax zup walm wif walm
   green yellow yellow yellow red red red

From these examples, we can draw some initial observations:

- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" at the end of the sequence. In example 2, ""wif"" is not at the end and translates to ""red red.""
- ""walm"" translates to a repeated ""yellow,"" with the number of repetitions corresponding to the number of ""walm"" in a row. For example, two consecutive ""walm"" result in ""yellow yellow yellow yellow,"" as seen in example 5.
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" when it is not preceded by ""zup"" but translates to ""blue red"" when preceded by ""zup,"" as seen in example 3.

Now, let's take a closer look at ""zup"":

- In examples 1 and 3, ""zup"" precedes different words (""dax"" and ""lug"") and translates to ""yellow"" regardless of the following word.
- In example 4, ""zup"" is followed by ""walm dax"" and also translates to ""yellow"" before that sequence.
- In example 5, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and translates to ""yellow"" as well.

Combining these observations, we can conclude:

zup -> yellow.

Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the words that follow it in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, ""bluf"" seems to correspond directly to the color associated with the word preceding it. For instance:

- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", hence ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"".
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", so ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red"".

Thus, it seems that ""bluf"" acts as a mirror or duplicate for the color denoted by the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the word before bluf.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" results in a sequence of three colored outputs that match the color of the word immediately preceding ""walm"". 

Here are the cases:

1. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and is followed by three ""yellow"" before the next word, ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"".

2. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and is followed by three ""blue"" before the next word, ""dax"", which corresponds to ""green"".

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and is followed by three ""green"".

4. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and three ""green"" appear before the next words, which correspond to their respective colors.

5. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and is followed by three ""blue"" before the next words, which correspond to their respective colors. When ""walm"" appears again after ""lug"", another sequence of three ""blue"" appears.

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times before proceeding to the next word's corresponding color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup
    ",Output: green yellow,green yellow,True,33
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: In each example, the presence of the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the word ""dax.""

In every instance where ""dax"" appears as an input, the output is ""green."" This consistency seems to indicate that ""dax"" translates directly to ""green"" regardless of its position in a sequence or the other words surrounding it.

Additionally, there appears to be a pattern for the other nonce words where each translates to a specific color, for example:
- ""lug"" always corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when it appears in the input.
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" when it appears in the input.
This suggests that each nonce word has a one-to-one correspondence with a color name in English.

Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" is:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" This is consistent across all examples provided, as each instance of ""wif"" is translated to ""red"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided:

Input: zup dax lug zup -> Output: yellow green blue yellow
Input: zup -> Output: yellow
Input: zup -> Output: yellow
Input: wif zup -> Output: red yellow
Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow

The word ""zup"" consistently maps to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that the output color is determined by the position of the given word in the input sequence. Here is how the rule is applied:

1. ""zup"" consistently translates to the output ""yellow.""
2. ""dax"" consistently translates to the output ""green.""
3. ""wif"" consistently translates to the output ""red.""
4. ""lug"" consistently translates to the output ""blue.""
5. ""bluf,"" given the context, seems to consistently translate to the output color that is the same as the previous color in the sequence.

Applying this rule, let's look at the instances where ""bluf"" appears and the corresponding output:

1. ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" meaning ""bluf"" translated to ""yellow,"" the color corresponding to ""zup.""
2. ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" meaning ""bluf"" translated to ""green,"" the color corresponding to ""dax.""
3. ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" meaning ""bluf"" translated to ""blue,"" the color corresponding to ""lug.""

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule for the nonce word ""bluf"":

bluf -> meaning. The nonce word ""bluf"" represents a color which is identical to the color associated with the word immediately preceding it in the sequence. Rule: If a word X is immediately followed by the word ""bluf,"" the color output for ""bluf"" will be the same as the color output for the word X.
To deduce the rule, let's look for patterns related to the word ""walm"" in each of the examples:

1. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
2. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green
3. dax walm zup lug walm -> green green green yellow blue blue blue
4. lug wif dax zup walm -> blue red green yellow yellow yellow
5. wif walm dax -> red red red green

We can notice that the words ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""wif"", and ""dax"" correspond to single colors:
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green

When we look at the outputs that contain the word ""walm,"" we see repetitions of threes preceding a color that corresponds to the next word.

- In the first example, ""walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" followed by ""red"" which corresponds to ""wif.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by ""blue blue blue,"" corresponding to ""lug,"" and then comes ""green,"" corresponding to ""dax.""
- The third example contains two occurrences of ""walm."" The first ""walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" and, next comes ""yellow"" for ""zup,"" while the second instance leads to ""blue blue blue,"" again corresponding to ""lug.""
- In the fourth example, we see a ""walm"" at the end producing ""yellow yellow yellow,"" following the color for ""zup.""
- The fifth example finally has ""walm"" leading to ""red red red,"" followed by ""green,"" corresponding to ""dax.""

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" indicates that the color corresponding to the immediately following word should be repeated three times before moving onto the next color in the sequence. 

Therefore, walm -> Repeat the next word's corresponding color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently translated to ""blue"" in each example, regardless of position or surrounding words.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" is consistently translated to ""green"" in each example provided.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Other words seem to correspond to their own unique colors, such as ""dax"" corresponding to ""green"", ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" corresponding to ""red"" once again. 

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the rule for what 'zup' means, let's first look at instances where 'zup' is used in the examples:

1. zup wif zup dax -> yellow red yellow green
2. zup -> yellow
3. lug bluf wif lug bluf zup -> blue blue red blue blue yellow
4. wif zup bluf -> red yellow yellow
5. lug bluf zup lug -> blue blue yellow blue

Observations:

- Whenever 'zup' appears stand-alone, it is translated to 'yellow.' 
- When 'zup' appears in sequences, it is also translated to 'yellow.'

Based on the given examples, 'zup' consistently translates to 'yellow' regardless of its position in the sequence or the context provided by surrounding words. There are no examples that contradict this direct translation.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Given the examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" is not a content word with a fixed meaning but instead repeats the color that corresponds to the word that immediately follows ""bluf"". Analyzing each instance where the word is used, we can observe the following pattern:

1. ""lug bluf dax lug"" becomes ""blue blue green blue"". Here ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" and ""lug"", producing ""blue"" and ""green"" respectively, but since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""bluf"" preceding it also corresponds to ""blue"".

2. In the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup"" and ""dax"", and it translates to ""green"" and ""yellow"" – the colors that correspond to ""dax"" and ""zup"".

3. The third example shows ""bluf"" followed by ""wif"" and ""lug"", with the output being ""red"" and ""blue"" – the colors associated with ""wif"" and ""lug"".

4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" again, and the output is ""blue"", which aligns with the interpretation of ""lug"".

5. The last example provides the sequence of ""zup lug zup bluf lug"". The word ""bluf"" is preceded and followed by ""lug"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow"", the color corresponding to ""zup"".

From these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" adopts the color of the next word in the sequence.

Therefore, the meaning is:

bluf -> the color of the following word.
To decipher the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the output of the sentences that contain ""walm"" with those that don't:

- ""lug wif walm"" yields ""blue red red red""
- ""zup walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""lug walm wif bluf"" yields ""blue blue blue red red""
- ""wif walm dax zup"" yields ""red red red green yellow""
- ""wif walm zup"" yields ""red red red yellow""

Now, let's analyze the instances where ""walm"" occurs and their respective outputs:

- Whenever ""walm"" is present, the color repeated three times in the output corresponds to the color assigned for the word immediately before ""walm.""


Let's apply this possible rule induction to the given examples:

1. ""lug wif walm""
     ""lug"" = blue
     The output is ""blue red red red.""
     The word before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" and the color ""red"" is repeated three times.

2. ""zup walm""
    ""zup"" = yellow
    The output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
    The word before ""walm"" is ""zup,"" and the color ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

3. ""lug walm wif bluf""
    ""lug"" = blue
    The output is ""blue blue blue red red.""
    The word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" and the color ""blue"" is repeated three times.

4. ""wif walm dax zup""
    ""wif"" = red
    The output is ""red red red green yellow.""
    The word before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" and the color ""red"" is repeated three times.

5. ""wif walm zup""
    ""wif"" = red
    The output is ""red red red yellow.""
    The word before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" and the color ""red"" is repeated three times.

Based on these observations, the likely meaning or rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,35
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To induce the rule for the nonce word ""lug,"" let's analyze the examples given.

1. Input: ""wif lug dax"" -> Output: ""red blue green""
2. Input: ""lug bluf"" -> Output: ""blue blue""
3. Input: ""zup walm lug"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow yellow blue""
4. Input: ""lug zup dax wif"" -> Output: ""blue yellow green red""
5. Input: ""dax lug walm"" -> Output: ""green blue blue blue""

Looking at these examples, we can try to identify the rule by looking at instances of when ""lug"" occurs and what the color output is:

- In example 1, ""lug"" is followed by ""dax,"" and the output colors are ""red blue green."" Since ""dax"" matches with ""green,"" lug might mean ""blue"" here as the second color.
- In example 2, ""lug"" stands alone with ""bluf,"" and the output is ""blue blue,"" which suggests that either ""lug"" or ""bluf"" might mean ""blue."" However, given that there is no change in color and the repetition, it could be inferred that ""lug"" means ""blue.""
- In example 3, ""lug"" is at the end, following ""zup walm,"" with the output being three ""yellows"" followed by ""blue."" Since the colors before ""blue"" match the pattern of other words, it seems like ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" once again.
- In example 4, ""lug"" comes before ""zup"" and ""dax wif,"" with the output being ""blue yellow green red."" Here, the pattern that ""lug"" appears first and is represented as ""blue"" in the output continues.
- In example 5, ""dax"" and ""walm"" are connected to ""green"" and ""blue,"" respectively, either individually or repeated. Since ""lug"" precedes the ""blue"" colors in the output, it seems to stand for ""blue"" again.

From these examples, it appears that ""lug"" consistently equates to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each nonce word in an input is systematically associated with a specific color in the output. Notably, the English word 'dax' consistently corresponds to the color 'green' regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Hence, the rule can be written as:

Rule: dax -> green.
From the given examples, we can attempt to deduce a rule for the meaning of ""wif"" by comparing the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Let's examine each example and look for patterns:

1. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - We see that ""wif"" corresponds to the first output, which is ""red"".

2. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   - Here, ""wif"" is the last word in the sequence and corresponds to the last output color, ""red"".

3. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   - ""wif"" is the first word here and the output is ""red"". The word ""bluf"", which we don't have information about, also corresponds to ""red"".

4. Input: dax wif zup
   Output: green red yellow
   - The ""wif"" in the middle of the sequence corresponds to ""red"".

5. Input: wif
   Output: red
   - ""wif"" in isolation still leads to the output ""red"".

In every instance of ""wif"", no matter its position in the sequence, the output is ""red"". Therefore, we can induce the rule:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow."" Each instance of the word ""zup"" in the input directly corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output sequence regardless of the position of ""zup"" within the sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> meaning. The word ""bluf"" translates to the color that is mentioned immediately before it.

Rule: Repeat the color word that appears directly before ""bluf"".
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" is transformed into a color. Furthermore, ""walm"" seems to be outputting the color that directly precedes it, meaning that if the word before ""walm"" is translated to ""red"", then ""walm"" becomes ""red"" as well. If ""walm"" is the first word or if there is no color word before it, then it defaults to ""yellow"", as seen in the third set of input and output.

Let's verify this with each example:

- zup lug walm wif dax -> yellow blue blue blue red green
  - ""zup"" is yellow, ""lug"" is blue, ""walm"" becomes blue following the rule, ""wif"" is red, and ""dax"" is green.

- dax walm wif lug dax walm -> green green green red blue green green green
  - ""dax"" is green, hence the first ""walm"" is green, then ""wif"" is red, ""lug"" is blue, and the second ""dax"" is green. The second ""walm"" follows the color of the previous word, which is green.

- zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red
  - ""zup"" is yellow, the first ""walm"" does not follow a color word so it defaults to yellow, ""lug"" is blue, ""wif"" is red, and since ""bluf"" is not providing a color output, it is disregarded.

- dax zup walm wif walm -> green yellow yellow yellow red red red
  - ""dax"" is green, ""zup"" is yellow, the first ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and is yellow, ""wif"" is red, and the second ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and is also red.

- zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
  - ""zup"" is yellow, ""wif"" is red, then ""walm"" follows and is red, and ""lug"" is blue.

From these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word before it; if there is no preceding word to take a color from, it defaults to yellow.

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the preceding word's output or yellow if no applicable preceding word is present.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning: blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Every instance of the word ""lug"" in the input is translated to ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the word ""green"" in each of the outputs. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red

This means that wherever ""wif"" appears in the input, it translates to ""red"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, each input word seems to correspond to a specific color output. The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in each example given. Additionally, each occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" The word ""walm"" also corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Thus, the rule appears to be that each unique word is assigned a fixed color. The rule for ""zup"" is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" has the effect of repeating the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it. Analyzing the outputs, we can see that whenever ""bluf"" appears after a word, the color that corresponds to the preceding word is given twice in the output.

Here's the breakdown:

- ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow,"" so ""zup"" must correspond to yellow, and ""bluf"" causes the repetition.
- Similarly, ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red,"" which means ""wif"" corresponds to red and is repeated because of ""bluf"".
- In the sequence ""lug bluf wif lug bluf zup,"" we have ""blue blue red blue blue yellow,"" so ""lug"" corresponds to blue and both instances of ""bluf"" cause a repetition of the color.
- The sequence ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" results in ""red green red red yellow red"", where ""bluf"" again causes the previous color (red) to be repeated in the output.

Rule: bluf -> causes the repetition of the preceding word's corresponding color in the output.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" from the examples, let's examine each instance of ""walm"" and its corresponding output color:

1. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
Here, ""walm"" corresponds to yellow.

2. ""dax walm zup lug"" -> green green green yellow blue
Here, ""walm"" corresponds to green.

3. ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" -> red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
Both instances of ""walm"" correspond to red and then to blue.

4. ""lug dax walm"" -> blue green green green
Here, ""walm"" corresponds to green.

5. ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" -> yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
Here, ""walm"" corresponds to yellow.

From these examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that preceded it in the input. So the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it mimics the color of the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> takes on the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,37
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
Based on the provided examples, a consistent pattern emerges concerning the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" and the surrounding context:

- Every instance where the word ""dax"" is used in isolation or follows the word ""bluf,"" the output is ""green.""
- Whenever ""dax"" follows the word ""zup,"" the output associated with ""dax"" is ""green,"" but ""zup"" itself corresponds to ""yellow.""

From these examples, the word ""wif,"" which follows ""zup dax zup"" in the one example it appears, is translated to ""red.""

Rule: ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" regardless of the surrounding words. The color ""yellow"" is associated with the word ""zup,"" and ""wif"" is associated with ""red.""
Based on the input-output pairs provided:

- ""dax lug wif"" corresponds to ""green blue red""
- ""zup wif"" corresponds to ""yellow red""
- ""lug wif bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red red""
- ""zup wif zup"" corresponds to ""yellow red yellow""
- ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" corresponds to ""blue blue red blue red red red blue""

From the examples given:

- Each occasion where ""wif"" appears, it corresponds to the output ""red"".
- Other words before ""wif"" correspond to different colors (e.g., ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow"").

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> ""red""
Based on the examples provided, we can see that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position within the input sequence. Therefore, using the examples as indicators:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> red

Rule: The word 'bluf' translates to 'red'.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word 'walm' generates a repetition of the color word that comes right before it in the output. Here's the rule observed:

- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"": the word 'lug' seems to be associated with ""blue"", and 'walm' causes it to be repeated twice more.
- ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green green green red"": 'dax' translates to ""green"", 'walm' causes it to be repeated twice more, and 'wif' translates to ""red"".
- ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""green red yellow yellow red red red"": 'walm' comes after 'wif', which corresponds to ""red"", hence ""red"" is repeated twice.
- ""dax lug dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue green blue blue blue"": 'walm' follows 'lug' which corresponds to ""blue"", and thus ""blue"" is repeated thrice.
- ""wif walm dax"" -> ""red red red green"": 'walm' comes after 'wif' which is associated with ""red"", so ""red"" is repeated twice before moving on to 'dax', which translates to ""green"".

Rule: walm -> causes the color word that comes immediately before it to repeat twice more in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the series of nonce words.
Rule: dax -> green

Meaning: In the given context, the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Each occurrence of ""wif"" in the input results in ""red"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the word 'zup' consistently corresponds to the color 'yellow' in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: The word ""bluf"" means to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. 

For example, 
- ""wif"" is associated with the color red, so ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red.""
- ""lug"" is associated with the color blue, so ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue.""
- ""dax"" is associated with the color green, and since ""zup"" seems to be always yellow, ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow"" (repeating the yellow for ""zup"").
- In the sequence ""lug wif lug dax bluf,"" the ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" which is associated with green, so the output ends with ""green green.""
Based on the given input-output pairs, the nonce word ""walm"" induces repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it. Each example shows a non-""walm"" word translated to a color, followed by ""walm"" which causes the repetition of the color associated with the word it follows.

Looking at the patterns:

- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue,"" which means ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes the word ""blue"" to repeat twice more.
- ""wif walm dax"" outputs ""red red red green,"" which infers ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""walm"" causes ""red"" to repeat twice more, and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""wif walm"" without a word following ""walm"" outputs ""red red red,"" again showing ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""red"" twice more.
- ""lug wif walm"" outputs ""blue red red red,"" indicating that ""walm"" causes the last mentioned color (""red"") to repeat three times.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" is:

walm -> Causes the color associated with the preceding word to repeat three times in total.

Rule: If X is a word that translates to color Y, then ""X walm"" translates to ""Y Y Y.""

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given outputs, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words around it.
Based on the provided examples, we can identify a pattern for the word ""dax"" and its corresponding output. In every instance, ""dax"" translates to the word ""green.""

Examples broken down:

- dax lug -> green blue
- zup dax walm zup wif -> yellow green green green yellow red
- zup wif dax walm -> yellow red green green green
- wif zup dax bluf -> red yellow green green
- dax bluf lug wif -> green green blue red

In each case, the word following ""dax"" is translated as ""green"" regardless of what that next word is. Therefore:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
Given the examples, we can analyze each situation to notice a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup."" Let's review the examples one by one:

- When ""zup"" is combined with ""bluf,"" we get ""yellow yellow,"" which leads us to initially assume that ""zup"" might mean ""yellow.""
- However, when ""zup"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red yellow,"" which again includes ""yellow.""
- With ""zup walm,"" we get ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" could also be generating the color ""yellow,"" but it seems ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow.""
- The longer sequence ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" generates ""green blue yellow red red green."" The only single output that isn't paired with a repeated color is yellow, corresponding to ""zup,"" which again suggests that ""zup"" might mean ""yellow.""
- In the last example, ""zup"" appears twice and each time it is followed by the color ""yellow.""

Given this consistent pattern across different examples, we can deduce the following rule:

zup -> meaning: ""yellow""

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the output is ""yellow.""
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to examine the patterns in the input and output sequences. Let's start by isolating instances of ""bluf"" and its output counterpart:

1. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
2. wif dax zup wif dax bluf -> red green yellow red green green
3. lug zup bluf dax -> blue yellow yellow green
4. dax bluf lug wif -> green green blue red
5. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red

Looking at the examples we see that ""bluf"" always has a pair of colors in the output which are identical. We also observe that, in every case, the color preceding ""bluf"" is the same color repeated twice in the output. This implies that ""bluf"" may mean to repeat the color of the word immediately prior to it.

For instance:
- Example 1: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow.""
- Example 2: The word immediately before ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" thus ""bluf"" translates to ""green green.""
- Example 3: ""zup"" is before ""bluf"" and corresponds to ""yellow,"" making ""bluf"" output ""yellow yellow.""
- Example 4: ""dax"" comes before ""bluf"" and matches ""green,"" so ""bluf"" means ""green green.""
- Example 5: Here, ""wif"" is before ""bluf"" and represents ""red,"" so ""bluf"" leads to ""red red.""

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" is to output the color associated with the immediately preceding word, repeated twice.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the previous word twice.
In each example, the occurrence of the word 'walm' corresponds to repeating the color related to the word immediately preceding it. So, 'walm' seems to function as an instruction to repeat the color associated with the previous word.

Given the data:

- ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue,"" where 'walm' causes the repetition of the color 'red' which is associated with 'wif'.
- ""wif dax lug walm"" translates to ""red green blue blue blue,"" where 'walm' causes the repetition of the color 'blue' which is associated with 'lug'.
- ""zup lug walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue,"" where 'walm' causes the repetition of the color 'blue' which is associated with 'lug'.
- ""lug walm zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow red,"" where 'walm' causes the repetition of the color 'blue' which is associated with 'lug'.
- ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" where 'walm' causes the repetition of the color 'yellow' which is associated with 'zup'.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"". Here is how the translation works according to each example:

1. Input: wif lug walm 
   Output: red blue blue blue
   
   In this example, the only word that is translated to ""blue"" and correlates with the input ""lug"" is ""blue"".
   
2. Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf 
   Output: blue red red green blue blue
   
   Again, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
   
3. Input: dax lug 
   Output: green blue
   
   ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
   
4. Input: wif lug 
   Output: red blue
   
   ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
   
5. Input: lug zup dax lug dax 
   Output: blue yellow green blue green
   
   ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Rule: lug -> ""blue""
Based on the given examples, we can infer the following correlations between the nonce word ""dax"" and its output:

- In the first example, ""lug wif dax zup walm"" results in ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow."" The word ""dax"" precedes ""zup walm,"" which outputs to ""green yellow yellow."" 
- In the second example, ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green."" Here, ""dax"" is at the end, following ""wif,"" with the output being ""green.""
- The third example, ""lug zup dax wif zup"" gives us ""blue yellow green red yellow."" The word ""dax"" comes after ""zup"" and before ""wif,"" resulting in ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax lug"" corresponds to ""green blue."" ""Dax"" is at the beginning and is followed by ""lug,"" which translates to ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug dax lug,"" we have ""blue green blue."" ""Dax"" is between two ""lug,"" with the corresponding output being ""green.""

From all the provided examples, regardless of its position, the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green."" 

Rule: dax -> green.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we should look at the patterns in which the word is used in each example and compare these to the patterns in the outputs:

1. ""dax bluf wif"" corresponds to ""green green red.""
2. ""dax wif walm"" corresponds to ""green red red red.""
3. ""lug wif"" corresponds to ""blue red.""
4. ""dax wif"" corresponds to ""green red.""
5. ""wif dax bluf"" corresponds to ""red green green.""

We notice that in examples 1, 3, and 4, ""wif"" appears at the end of the input and corresponds to a ""red"" at the end of the output.

In example 5, ""wif"" is at the beginning of the input and corresponds to the ""red"" at the beginning of the output.

We also notice that the presence of other words like ""dax,"" ""bluf,"" and ""lug"" in the input seems to correspond to distinct colors like ""green"" and ""blue"" in the output, and when they are paired with ""wif,"" the consistent color that ""wif"" corresponds to is ""red.""

Therefore, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow. 

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" appears to be translated as ""red"" when it follows another color word. When it comes before any color word, it simply repeats that color word before showing its own color (red). So, the rule seems to be:

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a color word, it repeats that color. When ""bluf"" is followed by a color word, it first repeats the following color word's output and then shows its own color, which is ""red"".

bluf -> rule described above.
Rule: walm -> repeated color of the previous word. 

The meaning of ""walm"" seems to depend on the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it, repeating that color the same number of times as the letters in the word ""walm"". 

Examples:
- ""lug walm"" resulted in ""blue blue blue blue"" since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" has four letters, thus repeating ""blue"" four times.
- ""wif walm"" resulted in ""red red red"" since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""walm"" has four letters, repeating ""red"" four times.
- ""dax walm"" resulted in ""green green green"" since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""walm"" has four letters, repeating ""green"" four times.

Hence, ""walm"" takes the color of the word just before it and echoes it as many times as there are letters in ""walm"" (which is four).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the outputs.
Based on the provided examples, we can infer a rule that directly relates the nonce word ""dax"" to a color output. To determine this, we look at the consistent output whenever ""dax"" appears in the input:

1. Input: ""dax"" -> Output: ""green""
2. Input: ""lug zup dax wif zup"" -> Output: ""blue yellow green red yellow""
3. Input: ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" -> Output: ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue""
4. Input: ""dax"" -> Output: ""green""
5. Input: ""dax lug zup"" -> Output: ""green blue yellow""

In each case where ""dax"" appears, regardless of the context or position within the input string, the corresponding output consistently includes ""green."" Other words in the input sequence correspond with their own unique color output. Thus, we can induce the following rule:

dax -> ""green""
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. The presence of other nonce words (e.g., zup, dax, lug, bluf) translates to other colors (yellow, green, blue) and their positions relative to ""wif"" determine the sequence in which the colors are outputted. If ""wif"" is alone, only the color ""red"" is outputted.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"", regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that the nonce word ""bluf"" correlates to the color that precedes it. To approach this systematically, let's look at each instance where ""bluf"" is used and identify the color word before it:

1. dax zup lug zup bluf -> green yellow blue yellow yellow
2. wif bluf -> red red
3. lug bluf -> blue blue
4. wif dax zup bluf -> red green yellow yellow
5. lug dax bluf zup lug wif -> blue green green yellow blue red

From these examples, we can consistently observe that the color word immediately preceding ""bluf"" is repeated in the output. This allows us to induce the following rule:

bluf -> The color word preceding ""bluf"" is repeated in the output.

So, if ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", then ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red"". If ""lug"" stands for ""blue"", then ""lug bluf"" becomes ""blue blue"". Hence, ""bluf"" acts as an instruction to repeat the color mentioned right before it.
Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to trigger a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it, three times. 

For instance:
1. ""zup walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow"" – ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" repeats this color thrice.
2. ""lug walm"" in ""lug walm zup lug walm"" gives ""blue blue blue"" before ""yellow"", which is from ""zup"", and then ""blue blue blue"" again after ""zup"", as ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
3. ""dax walm"" in ""dax walm wif bluf"" gives ""green green green"" and ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"", since ""wif"" comes before ""bluf"" and seems to correspond to a single ""red""; ""bluf"" has no rule evident from the examples and thus does not repeat.
4. For ""zup dax walm zup wif"", ""zup"" forthwith is ""yellow"", followed by ""dax"" which is green, leading to ""walm"" causing ""green green green"". Finally, ""zup wif"" results in ""yellow red"", with ""wif"" seemingly causing ""red"" to follow.

Therefore: walm -> triggers a repetition of the previous color word mentioned, three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm wif
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow red,yellow yellow yellow red,True,42
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every given example.
Based on the given examples, the meaning of the word ""dax"" seems to be associated with the color green. Every instance of the word ""dax"" in the input corresponds to the color green in the output:

- In the first example, ""dax zup bluf"" corresponds to ""green yellow yellow"", with the first ""green"" mapping directly to ""dax"".
- In the second example, ""wif walm dax"" results in ""red red red green"", where ""green"" is the only color that follows after ""dax"".
- The third example is simply ""dax"", with the output being ""green"", directly correlating the two.
- The fourth example, ""wif dax"", has an output of ""red green"", with ""green"" again following ""dax"".
- In the last example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" outputs ""red red green green green"", with the first instance of ""green"" occurring directly after ""dax"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green. ""Dax"" corresponds to the color green.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" consistently. Each time ""wif"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output sequence. There don't seem to be additional contextual factors or patterns that alter the meaning of ""wif"" within these examples—it maintains a one-to-one relationship with the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> ""red""
Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the given examples, whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it directly corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output. There are no examples that contradict this direct replacement rule.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at each of the given input-output pairs and try to identify a pattern.

1. Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
2. Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif -> Output: red red yellow yellow red
3. Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green
4. Input: zup dax bluf -> Output: yellow green green
5. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Analyzing the above examples, we can observe that the appearance of the word ""bluf"" in the input results in the repeated output of the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" For instance:

- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" we get ""yellow yellow.""
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" we get ""red red.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" we get ""green green.""

From the given data, it seems that ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the given examples, let's analyze the pattern of outputs corresponding to the presence of ""walm"" and other words.

Looking at all the inputs that contain ""walm"", we see that the word immediately following ""walm"" is always red, except when ""walm"" is the last word. Let's now look at the color immediately preceding ""walm"":

1. In the first example, ""dax walm zup"" translates to ""green green green"", suggesting a repeated green before turning to the next color associated with ""zup"" (yellow).

2. In the second example, ""wif walm lug"" translates to ""red red red"", suggesting repeated red before turning to the next color associated with ""lug"" (blue).

3. The third example is simpler: ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"", which shows us that ""walm"" is followed by repetitions of ""red"".

4. The fourth example, ""dax walm wif,"" translates to ""green green green red,"" again suggesting that ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color green before finally transitioning to red.

5. In the last example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" showing us once more that ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the preceding color which is yellow.

From these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat the color corresponding to the previous word until the next word, which will have its own color. If ""walm"" is at the end, it will simply repeat the color corresponding to the word just before it without a transition to another color.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> causes a repetition of the previous color in the output until the next word. If ""walm"" is the last word, that color is simply repeated.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,43
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in every example. Each instance of the word ""lug"" in the input is translated to ""blue"" in the output.
Given the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Here's a breakdown of the evidence from the examples:

- Example 1: ""dax wif"" corresponds to ""green red.""
- Example 2: ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" corresponds to ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow."" Since ""dax"" is only at the beginning, it can be inferred that ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- Example 3 (repetition of example 1): ""dax wif"" corresponds to ""green red"" again reaffirming the translation.
- Example 4: ""zup lug dax"" corresponds to ""yellow blue green."" ""Dax"" is at the end and ""green"" accounts for its position.
- Example 5: ""dax lug wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green blue red red."" Again, ""dax"" is at the start and corresponds to ""green.""

Dax -> Meaning

Rule: ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that every instance of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output. Here are the mappings according to each example:

Input: wif dax wif
Output: red green red
- Both ""wif"" instances correlate with ""red"".

Input: lug wif
Output: blue red
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red"".

Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
Output: blue red red green blue blue
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red"".

Input: lug wif lug
Output: blue red blue
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red"".

Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
Output: yellow red green red red
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red"".

Given these examples, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the context provided by the surrounding words (like ""walm,"" ""dax,"" ""bluf,"" ""wif,"" and ""lug,"" which seem to translate to other colors).

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the following observations can be made:

1. ""lug bluf"" outputs ""blue blue"" which indicates that ""bluf"" might stand for ""blue"", given ""lug"" also translates to ""blue"".
2. ""lug wif bluf"" outputs ""blue red red"" which implies that ""bluf"" could take the meaning ""red"" in this context, since ""wif"" is translated to ""red"".
3. ""dax zup bluf"" outputs ""green yellow yellow"", suggesting that ""bluf"" represents ""yellow"" in this instance, following ""zup"" which also means ""yellow"".
4. ""zup wif bluf zup"" outputs ""yellow red red yellow"", indicating ""bluf"" might mean ""red"" when preceded by ""wif"".
5. ""wif bluf dax lug"" outputs ""red red green blue"", which, taking the rules applied so far, would suggest that ""bluf"" means ""red"" in this case.

To reconcile these findings into a rule:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" is repeated twice from the color word that comes right before it. If ""lug"" means ""blue,"" then ""lug bluf"" becomes ""blue blue."" If ""wif"" means ""red,"" then ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red."" If ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" then ""zup bluf"" becomes ""yellow yellow."" Essentially, ""bluf"" takes the color of the word directly before it and repeats it.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's consider the accompanying words and their corresponding colors:

- ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green.""
- ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the one instance it appears.

Now, we observe what happens when ""walm"" is introduced:

1. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
2. ""dax walm zup"" -> ""green green green yellow""
3. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
4. ""dax zup dax walm"" -> ""green yellow green green green""
5. ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green""

Analyzing the patterns, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word that comes before it, given that after ""walm"" is introduced, the color that follows is a repetition of the color corresponding to the word just before ""walm."" For instance, in the first example, ""dax"" is ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" there are two more ""green."" In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which is ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" we see a repetition of ""green"" before encountering ""zup,"" which changes the sequence to ""yellow."" In the third and fifth examples, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and ""zup,"" respectively, and the repeat pattern holds.

Hence, we can determine the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the previous word to be repeated.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,44
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue in every example provided.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to a particular color in the output regardless of its position or the other words present in the input. In every instance where ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" is part of the resultant output.

Let's examine each instance:

1. Input: wif zup dax
   Output: red yellow green
   Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

2. Input: dax
   Output: green
   ""Dax"" is the only word in the input and the output is solely ""green.""

3. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" is possibly repeating the color tied to ""zup,"" and ""dax"" results in the color ""green.""

4. Input: dax
   Output: green
   Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

5. Input: wif dax
   Output: red green
   ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Based on these observations, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, we can observe that the presence of the word ""wif"" in the input always corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words surrounding it.

Input: zup wif zup dax
Output: yellow red yellow green
(Here ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the second position.)

Input: lug wif
Output: blue red
(""wif"" is the second word and corresponds to ""red"".)

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
(""wif"" is the last word and corresponds to ""red"".)

Input: lug zup dax wif
Output: blue yellow green red
(Again, ""wif"" is the last word and corresponds to ""red"".)

Input: lug wif zup wif
Output: blue red yellow red
(""wif"" appears twice and each time corresponds to ""red"".)

Therefore, the rule we can infer is:
Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- bluf -> yellow

To clarify, ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: Each nonce word is associated with a specific color, and ""zup"" always means ""yellow"".
To determine what ""bluf"" means, let's look at the patterns:

- When ""bluf"" appears after ""zup"", the output is ""yellow"".
- When ""bluf"" appears after ""lug"", the output is ""blue"".
- When ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"", the output is ""red"".
- When ""bluf"" appears after ""dax"", there are no direct examples, but where ""bluf"" appears next to ""dax"", it seems to be green in the sequence, but the position of ""bluf"" does not directly follow ""dax"".

From the examples provided, ""bluf"" seems to take the color of the word that comes before it in the sequence. 

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetitive output of the color that precedes it. Here's the analysis:

- ""wif lug dax walm"" corresponds to ""red blue green green green."" The word ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and is followed by three greens.
- ""lug walm wif bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue red red."" The word ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and is followed by two blues.
- ""wif dax lug walm"" corresponds to ""red green blue blue blue."" The word ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and is followed by two blues.
- ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green."" The word ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and is followed by two greens.
- ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow."" The word ""walm"" comes after ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and is followed by two yellows.

It seems that the word ""walm"" doesn't determine the number of times the color is repeated, as it varies across examples. However, the immediate color output directly before ""walm"" is consistently repeated after it.

Rule: walm -> meaning: Repeat the color that precedes the word ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif walm zup
    ",Output: red red red yellow,red red red yellow,True,45
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue.
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the word ""dax"" appears to be consistently translated to the color ""green"". Therefore, the meaning of ""dax"" in this context is the color green.

Rule: dax -> green
To figure out the meaning of ""wif,"" we can analyze the examples provided. Let's look at the input and output pairs:

1. Input: lug wif dax
   Output: blue red green
   
2. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
   Output: blue red green green red blue
   
3. Input: wif dax zup
   Output: red green yellow
   
4. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
   Output: yellow green red green red yellow
   
5. Input: wif
   Output: red

From these examples, we can observe the following:
- In every instance where ""wif"" appears, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
- The positions of other words (e.g., ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup"") correlate with other colors in the output (""blue,"" ""green,"" and ""yellow"" respectively), but ""wif"" consistently correlates with ""red.""

Based on this observation, the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red

Meaning that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
Based on the examples given:

1. When ""zup"" is mentioned on its own, the output is ""yellow."" (Example 1 and 2)
2. When ""lug walm zup walm"" is mentioned, ""lug"" and ""walm"" precede ""zup,"" each is output as ""blue"" three times, and then ""zup"" is output as ""yellow"" three times. (Example 3)
3. When ""zup lug"" is mentioned, ""zup"" is output as ""yellow"" and ""lug"" as ""blue."" (Example 4)
4. When ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" is mentioned, ""wif"" leads to the output of ""red"" three times, ""walm"" isn't directly followed by a color output, ""zup"" is output as ""yellow"" and is followed by ""lug"" which is ""blue,"" and then ""zup"" is followed again by ""yellow"" two times, and ""walm"" at the end leads to ""yellow"" two times. (Example 5)

From these observations, one can infer that ""zup"" may not have a fixed meaning on its own, but may rather signify a repetition of the color output associated with the preceding word, repeated the same number of times as the preceding output. However, the last example complicates this because ""wif"" and ""walm"" do not have an immediate repeated color output, and the repetition doesn't hold consistently for these cases. Additional patterns or examples would be needed to refine this rule.

Based on the limited data and to keep it as consistent as possible with the provided examples, we could infer the following:

Rule: ""zup"" means to repeat the color output of the word before it the same number of times the color has been output right before ""zup.""

However, due to the inconsistency in example 5, this is a tentative rule that may not hold in all situations until further examples are provided.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color produced by either combining the colors immediately preceding it or by repeating the color of the word that precedes it. Let's identify the patterns:

1. dax bluf wif -> green green red
   - ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and both have the output of green. It's not followed by any identical terms, so it looks like ""bluf"" takes the color of the term before it.

2. lug bluf dax lug -> blue blue green blue
   - ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and both have the output of blue.

3. lug zup bluf dax -> blue yellow yellow green
   - ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and repeats the output of yellow.

4. wif bluf -> red red
   - ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and both have the output of red.

5. zup lug zup lug zup bluf -> yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
   - ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and repeats the output color of yellow.

Looking at all these patterns, the rule that seems to be consistently applied is:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the immediate word preceding it.

So, bluf -> meaning. Meaning is: the color corresponding to the word that precedes ""bluf"".
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the color outputs relevant to its presence:

- ""dax walm lug"" outputs ""green green green blue""
- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" outputs ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue""
- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue""
- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow""

From these examples, we can see that whenever ""walm"" appears, the output color is repeated three times. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it indicates that the color should be repeated three times. It is not the source of the color itself but rather a modifier that dictates the quantity of the previous color output to be repeated.

Rule: walm -> repeat the previous color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,46
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue"". The meaning of ""lug"" is consistently represented by the color blue in all provided examples.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in each example provided.
wif -> red

Rule: The non-word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is mentioned, the corresponding output includes the word ""yellow."" Additionally, other words seem to correspond with specific colors as well: ""wif"" with ""red,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" and ""lug"" with ""blue."" The word ""walm"" is not explicitly matched with a color in these examples, but given the context in which ""walm"" is surrounded by ""zup"" in the input and by ""yellow"" in the output, it can be inferred that ""walm"" also corresponds to ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule I can deduce is:
zup -> yellow

Meaning:
zup translates to the color yellow in the given context.
Based on the examples provided, ""bluf"" appears to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here's the pattern observed:

1. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
   ""bluf"" repeats the color for ""zup"" which is yellow.

2. dax lug bluf wif -> green blue blue red
   ""bluf"" repeats the color for ""lug"" which is blue

3. dax wif bluf -> green red red
   ""bluf"" repeats the color for ""wif"" which is red

4. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red
   ""bluf"" repeats the color for ""wif"" which is red

5. wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   ""bluf"" repeats the color for ""zup"" which is yellow

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately before it.
Analyzing the provided examples, let's break down the sequences to identify the potential rule for ""walm."" Note the corresponding outputs:

1. dax walm -> green green green
2. zup dax walm lug wif -> yellow green green green blue red
3. dax walm -> green green green
4. dax zup dax walm -> green yellow green green green
5. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue

In every instance where ""walm"" appears, the output is a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" Here's the pattern in the outputs:

1. dax preceded walm -> green is repeated three times.
2. dax preceded walm, and the sequence is preceded by other colors -> green is repeated once for each occurrence of ""walm"" and once for each ""dax"" preceding it, followed by the colors corresponding to the other words.
3. The pattern repeated from example 1.
4. Two ""dax"" words preceded walm, leading to green being repeated three times, following the color for ""zup.""
5. ""lug"" preceded walm, resulting in blue being repeated three times.

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately before it to be repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow blue,yellow yellow yellow blue,True,47
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

- When the input ""lug zup"" leads to the output ""blue yellow"", ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"".
- The input ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" gives the output ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"", we can confirm that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" (assuming ""walm"" corresponds to multiple ""blue"").
- The pattern continues with ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" resulting in ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue"" and ""zup bluf dax lug"" resulting in ""yellow yellow green blue"", further affirming that the translation of ""lug"" is ""blue"".
- Lastly, ""dax bluf wif lug zup"" converts to ""green green red blue yellow"", which is consistent with ""lug"" translating to ""blue"".

Therefore, the rule deduced from the examples is:

Rule: lug -> blue
From examining the given examples, I can deduce that ""dax"" indicates the color to repeat the next color. Here's the rule based on each example's input-output pair:

1. Input: dax zup lug bluf 
   Output: green yellow blue blue
   Rule: ""dax"" causes the next color ""yellow"" to be replaced with ""green,"" and there is no repetition because ""dax"" does not precede ""bluf.""

2. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   Rule: The first ""dax"" causes the next color ""blue"" to repeat once. The second ""dax"" makes ""green"" repeat once after ""blue blue blue,"" the third ""dax"" makes ""red"" repeat once, and the fourth ""dax"" doesn't repeat any color since there's no subsequent color indicated.

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Rule: ""dax"" causes the next color ""green"" to repeat twice more.

4. Input: zup dax lug
   Output: yellow green blue
   Rule: ""dax"" comes after ""zup,"" so it doesn't affect ""yellow,"" but it causes the next color ""blue"" to change to ""green.""

5. Input: wif dax zup bluf
   Output: red green yellow yellow
   Rule: ""dax"" comes after ""wif"" and changes the next color ""yellow"" to ""green,"" and there is no repetition because ""dax"" does not precede ""bluf.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""dax"" appears to be:

Rule: When ""dax"" precedes a color word, it changes the subsequent color to ""green."" If there is another color word after ""dax,"" that color is repeated in the output, otherwise the sequence ends with ""green."" If ""dax"" is the first word in the sequence, then it translates directly to ""green.""

Thus:
dax -> change the next color to ""green"" and if another color follows, repeat that changed color.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
Analyzing the given examples:

1. `dax bluf wif lug zup` corresponds to `green green red blue yellow`
2. `dax walm wif bluf` corresponds to `green green green red red`
3. `lug bluf wif` corresponds to `blue blue red`
4. `zup lug zup lug zup bluf` corresponds to `yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow`
5. `lug walm wif lug bluf` corresponds to `blue blue blue red blue blue`

To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"", let us examine its occurrence in each sentence and the corresponding output color:

- In instance 1, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- In instance 2, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".
- In instance 3, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- In instance 4, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- In instance 5, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"".

From the examples given, ""bluf"" does not have a consistent corresponding output. However, we can observe that the color after ""bluf"" matches the color of the word that immediately precedes ""bluf."" Thus, it seems ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word:

- In instance 1, ""lug"" before ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue,"" therefore, ""bluf"" is ""blue.""
- In instance 2, ""wif"" before ""bluf"" is ""red,"" therefore, ""bluf"" is ""red.""
- In instance 3, ""lug"" before ""bluf"" is ""blue,"" therefore, ""bluf"" is ""blue.""
- In instance 4, ""zup"" before ""bluf"" is ""yellow,"" therefore, ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""
- In instance 5, ""lug"" before ""bluf"" is ""blue,"" therefore, ""bluf"" is ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns associated with each input and output.

- In inputs where ""dax"" is immediately followed by ""walm,"" such as ""dax walm,"" the output is ""green green green.""
- In the input ""dax wif walm,"" where ""wif"" is inserted between ""dax"" and ""walm,"" an additional ""red"" is inserted for each occurrence of ""wif."" Consequently, the output is ""green red red red.""
- In the third input, ""zup walm lug zup wif dax,"" we see that ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" which results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" ""Zup"" precedes ""walm"" and ""lug,"" and it maps to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" at the end results in another ""green.""
- The fourth input is the same as the first one, so the output is also the same: ""green green green.""
- Finally, the input ""wif lug dax walm"" maps to ""red blue,"" followed by the ""dax walm"" combination giving us ""green green green.""

From these patterns, we can infer the following rule: ""walm"" outputs ""green"" each time it appears in the sequence. However, the presence of other nonce words like ""wif"" changes the color sequence before ""walm"" is articulated in the output. 

Rule: ""walm"" translates to the sequence ""green green green,"" and other nonce words modify the outputs in different ways preceding this sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug walm dax
    ",Output: red blue green green green,red blue blue blue green,False,48
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples provided, each occurrence of the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output. This rule holds consistent across all examples.
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of ""wif"" by observing the patterns of input and their corresponding output.

- In the first example, ""wif dax wif"" results in ""red green red,"" indicating that the word ""wif"" may correspond to the color ""red.""
- The second example, ""wif dax zup,"" outputs ""red green yellow,"" reinforcing the idea that ""wif"" is equivalent to ""red,"" as it comes before ""green,"" which is the output for ""dax.""
- The third example, ""lug dax wif,"" translates to ""blue green red,"" further supporting the notion that ""wif"" means ""red"" since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" again corresponds to the color at the end of the sequence.
- The fourth example, ""dax zup walm wif walm,"" produces ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red."" Here ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red"" in the output, while the subsequent ""walm"" leads to repeated ""red"" outputs.
- The fifth example, ""wif bluf lug dax wif,"" outputs ""red red blue green red."" Here, ""wif"" seems to be both the first and last output, which are ""red.""

Based on the above observations, we can induce the following rule for the word ""wif"":

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the examples provided, every time the nonce word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the respective position in the output.
From the given examples, the pattern indicates that the output color for ""bluf"" duplicates the color of the preceding word. Here are the examples with the identified corresponding colors:

1. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
2. wif bluf lug dax wif -> red red blue green red
3. zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red
4. lug bluf -> blue blue
5. dax lug bluf -> green blue blue

Based on the pattern in each of these examples, ""bluf"" takes the color of the word before it and repeats it. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is:

Rule: bluf means to duplicate the color of the preceding word.

Bluf -> meaning: Duplicate the preceding color.
walm -> repetition of the color associated with the first word in the input three times.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" appears in the input, it causes the output to repeat the color associated with the first word three times. If ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" the sequence of three colors is followed by ""red."" If ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" then ""red"" replaces the repeated color sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can infer that ""lug"" serves as a color modifier within the sequence in which it is used. It takes the color associated with the word immediately following it and applies that color to the entire sequence until a new color is encountered. Here is the breakdown of each example:

- In the first sequence, ""lug wif"" leads to ""blue red"", which means ""lug"" caused ""blue"" to be applied to both ""walm"" and ""lug,"" until ""wif"" introduced a new color, ""red.""
- ""Dax lug dax"" leads to ""green blue green,"" indicating that ""lug"" caused ""blue"" to be in the middle, with ""dax"" maintaining its color ""green"" before and after.
- ""Lug wif lug"" outputs ""blue red blue,"" where ""lug"" on both ends dictates the color ""blue,"" coming from ""wif,"" despite ""wif"" providing a ""red"" color.
- ""Lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" meaning ""lug"" causes ""walm"" to be ""blue,"" and it extends this color to the entire sequence including itself.
- ""Lug zup lug"" results in ""blue yellow blue,"" where the first ""lug"" turns the sequence blue until ""zup"" introduces ""yellow,"" and then ""lug"" again applies ""blue"" after ""zup.""

Therefore:

Rule: lug -> changes the color of the entire sequence to the color of the next word and applies this color to itself and preceding words until a new color word appears.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the sequence.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the context.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the pattern of input to output in the given examples:

1. ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red"" suggesting that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".
2. ""dax bluf zup"" becomes ""green green yellow,"" again indicating that ""bluf"" likely corresponds to ""green.""
3. ""dax zup bluf"" becomes ""green yellow yellow,"" implying that ""bluf"" here must correspond to ""yellow.""
4. ""lug bluf dax lug"" becomes ""blue blue green blue,"" so in this case, ""bluf"" might correspond to ""blue.""
5. ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" becomes ""red yellow yellow red green"" which again would imply ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" in this position.

These results seem contradictory at first, as ""bluf"" seems to correspond to different colors in different instances. However, given that the output color matches the color stated immediately preceding ""bluf"" in each input, it seems likely that the rule for ""bluf"" is that it takes on the color of the preceding word or, when it's the first word, it duplicates its own corresponding color.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word in the list or duplicates its own color if it's the first word.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to be associated with repeating the color that corresponds to the word that comes just before ""walm."" Here are the observations:

1. ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" which indicates that the color before walm (red) is repeated three times.
2. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" results in ""green blue blue blue yellow red."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" subsequent to ""lug.""
3. ""wif lug walm"" leads to ""red blue blue blue,"" where again, ""lug"" is blue and it is followed by ""blue blue blue"" due to ""walm.""
4. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" gives ""yellow blue blue blue red green,"" reiterating the pattern with ""lug"" followed by ""blue blue blue"" attributed to ""walm.""
5. ""zup walm wif"" ends up as ""yellow yellow yellow red"" where ""zup"" is yellow and ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word right before it three times.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green

    Input: lug walm zup lug bluf wif

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue every time it appears. Here's the analysis:

- In all instances, whenever the word 'lug' is used in the input, 'blue' is the output.
- It does not appear to depend on position or surrounding words, as it is always translated to 'blue' regardless of its location in the sequence or the words around it.
  
Therefore, the rule appears to be quite straightforward:

Rule: lug -> blue
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's match each input word with its corresponding output color and look for a pattern:

First Input/Output Pair:
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- bluf -> red

Second Input/Output Pair:
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- bluf -> blue
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> blue

Third Input/Output Pair:
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> yellow
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- bluf -> red

Fourth Input/Output Pair:
- dax -> green
- walm -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green

Fifth Input/Output Pair:
- wif -> red
- dax -> green

In every case, ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green"". It does not seem to matter what position ""dax"" is in or what other words are present; whenever ""dax"" is the input, ""green"" is the output. Therefore, we can conclude:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following corresponding outputs for each word:

- wif: red
- zup: yellow
- lug: blue
- dax: green
- walm: green, repeated for the number of letters in ""walm"" (4 letters, hence green is repeated 3 times)

It seems that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the word ""red.""

Now let’s check our hypothesis with the given examples:

Input: wif
Output: red

Input: zup wif zup
Output: yellow red yellow

Input: wif
Output: red

Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

The word ""walm"" is particularly interesting—it appears as ""green green green"" in the first instance and ""yellow yellow yellow"" in the second. The difference in output seems to be influenced by the word preceding ""walm"" which is ""dax"" in the first instance and ""zup"" in the second. This suggests another rule that the color output for ""walm"" depends on the color associated with the previous word: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and the number of repeated colors corresponds to the count of letters in ""walm,"" but since this is not consistent for ""wif,"" we maintain our conclusion that ""wif"" simply means ""red.""

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow regardless of context in these examples. Other words seem to correspond to different colors (e.g., ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""lug"" corresponds to blue), but ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the color outputs corresponding to each input sequence and attempt to deduce the pattern:

1. ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow green yellow green red red."" 
   The ""bluf"" at the end results in an additional ""red.""

2. ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" corresponds to ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue.""
   ""bluf"" after ""zup"" results in an extra ""yellow.""

3. ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue.""
   The ""bluf"" here simply repeats the color before it, which is ""blue.""

4. ""wif lug zup bluf"" corresponds to ""red blue yellow yellow.""
   ""bluf"" after ""zup"" again results in an extra ""yellow.""

5. ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" corresponds to ""yellow blue red green green red.""
   ""bluf"" after ""dax"" results in an extra ""green,"" and the ""wif"" that follows changes the sequence to ""red.""

From these observations, we can derive the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that comes immediately before it unless that word is ""dax,"" in which case ""bluf"" results in an additional ""green""; if ""wif"" follows ""bluf,"" it changes to ""red"" regardless of the previous color.

Thus, bluf -> meaning would be: ""bluf"" means repeat the color of the preceding word, with specific exceptions for when preceded by ""dax"" or followed by ""wif."" 
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" is associated with the repetition of the color that immediately precedes it, repeated three times. Each unique word (e.g., ""zup,"" ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""wif"") seems to translate to a specific color:

- ""zup"" translates to yellow.
- ""dax"" translates to green.
- ""lug"" translates to blue.
- ""wif"" translates to red.

When ""walm"" follows any of these words, the output is the color corresponding to the word preceding ""walm,"" repeated three times. 

- After ""zup"" (yellow), ""walm"" results in ""red red red.""
- After ""dax"" (green), ""walm"" results in ""green green green.""
- After ""lug"" (blue), ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue.""
- After ""wif"" (red), ""walm"" results in ""red red red.""

It is important to note that the rule could also be that ""walm"" transforms the word before it into three copies of its corresponding color. However, since ""wif"" is the only fourth word in the list that directly precedes ""walm"" and ""wif"" has only ever been followed by ""red,"" the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the previous color regardless of what that color is.

Rule: walm -> Causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"".
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" always corresponds to the color green, irrespective of its position in the series of words.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" is consistently translated to the color ""red."" Regardless of its position in the sequence, it always corresponds to the same color in the output.

Thus, the rule is:

wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" correlates with the color ""red"" when following the word ""wif,"" and correlates with the color ""green"" when following the word ""dax."" It does not depend on the word ""lug"" or ""zup,"" as their presence does not appear to affect the resulting color associated with ""bluf.""

Therefore, it seems that ""bluf"" itself might change meaning based on the word that precedes it. The rule for ""bluf"" could be related to the word that comes directly before it, but we need additional examples to fully establish a pattern.

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it corresponds to the color ""red."" When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it corresponds to the color ""green."" For any other cases, more examples would be required to establish the rule.
Walm -> Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output color to be repeated the same number of times as there are letters in the input word preceding ""walm.""

Rule:
- In ""wif walm,"" ""wif"" has three letters, which corresponds to the output ""red red red.""
- In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" has three letters, resulting in ""blue blue blue.""
- In ""lug walm zup walm,"" ""lug"" is still three letters, so the first ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" and ""zup"" has three letters as well, so the second ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In ""wif walm dax zup,"" ""wif"" leads to ""red red red,"" and then ""dax"" leads to a single ""green,"" while ""zup"" changes to ""yellow.""
- The base color appears to correlate with the first word: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" does not seem to directly translate to a specific color but instead to a repetition pattern based on the preceding word's length.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue. Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue.""
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" each time it appears. Regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input or the other words around it, the output always includes the color ""green"" in the place corresponding to where ""dax"" appears in the input.

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we should look for patterns in each example to identify what ""wif"" corresponds to in the output.

- In the first example, ""lug bluf wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue red."" ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" seems to be a repetition of ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red."" Here, ""walm"" seems to correspond to ""red,"" and since ""wif"" is also outputted as ""red,"" it suggests that ""wif"" could mean ""red.""
- In the third example, ""lug wif dax walm zup"" corresponds to ""blue red green green green yellow."" ""Lug"" again corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""walm"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" 
- In the fourth example, ""wif zup"" corresponds to ""red yellow."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" again and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red."" Each instance of ""lug,"" ""walm,"" and ""zup"" is consistent with previous translations to ""blue,"" ""red,"" and ""yellow,"" respectively. The last ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Putting these observations together, it appears that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input string.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of ""zup"" by comparing the inputs and outputs:

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Input: zup bluf wif
Output: yellow yellow red

Input: zup
Output: yellow

Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

Input: lug zup wif
Output: blue yellow red

From the given examples, we can observe that whenever the word ""zup"" is present in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. Regardless of the presence or absence of other words, ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow."" 

The other words in the sequences do not appear to influence the output of ""zup."" Therefore, we can induce that ""zup"" by itself translates to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples given:

- ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue""
- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red""
- ""zup dax bluf"" translates to ""yellow green green""
- ""wif bluf"" (on its own) translates to ""red red""
- ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green""

It seems that ""bluf"" takes the color from the previous word and repeats it.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.
Based on the examples given, it is noticeable that the output preceding ""walm"" contains three identical color words. Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be related to repeating the color that would be the output for the word immediately before ""walm"" three times. The key to determining the color related to each input word can be seen in the context of each example provided. The outputs are consistently associated with the word preceding ""walm"".

Here is the breakdown:

1. ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green green green red"" suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
2. ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green"" suggests ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"".
3. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"" again suggests ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
4. ""zup walm dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green"" suggests ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
5. ""zup wif walm lug"" -> ""yellow red red red blue"" suggests ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Based on this analysis, we could formulate the following rule:

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" is encountered, it means to repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.

Therefore:
walm -> Repeat the color indicated by the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the provided examples. Each instance of ""lug"" in the input results in ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the other words present.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that different input words are consistently mapped to specific output colors. Here is the pattern that each word corresponds to a unique color:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> green
- lug -> blue
- walm -> green

However, the word ""bluf"" seems to produce ""red"" in one instance and ""green"" in another, which suggests an inconsistency or a more complex rule that has not been demonstrated with the given examples. Assuming there is a mistake, and ""bluf"" should consistently correspond to one color, the following rule can be formulated:

Rule: Each unique word corresponds to a specific color, regardless of its position in the sequence, with ""dax"" consistently mapping to the color ""green"".
Based on the given examples, the word `wif` consistently corresponds to the color `red`. 

Here are the examples and the color equivalents that support this:

1. zup dax walm lug wif -> yellow green green green blue red
2. wif -> red
3. wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue
4. lug bluf wif lug bluf zup -> blue blue red blue blue yellow
5. lug walm wif lug -> blue blue blue red blue

No matter the position of `wif` in the sequence or the surrounding words, the output for `wif` is always `red`. Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided:

1. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" translates to ""blue red yellow red red red,"" which implies that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" since it's the only word not directly translated in the before and after examples (lug -> blue, wif -> red, walm -> red red).

2. ""lug zup dax wif"" likewise translates to ""blue yellow green red,"" where zup is the second word and yellow is the second color. This supports the idea that zup corresponds to yellow, especially since the other words are consistently translated (lug -> blue, dax -> green, wif -> red).

3. ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow,"" reinforcing the rule since zup corresponds to the second color, yellow, and bluf is not previously defined but seems to result in yellow as well.

4. ""lug zup lug"" leads to ""blue yellow blue,"" where zup is between two instances of lug (which consistently translate to blue), and the middle color is yellow, suggesting zup stands for yellow.

5. ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow red blue green,"" and from the previous examples, we know wif, lug, and dax translate to red, blue, and green, respectively. Given that zup and bluf appear as the first two words and correspond to the first two colors, both yellow, it appears bluf also corresponds to yellow, reinforcing the translation of zup as yellow when it appears first.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" is:

zup -> yellow
Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to repeating the color of the immediately preceding word.

Applying this rule to the examples:

1. ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red."" ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which is yellow, so ""bluf"" repeats yellow.

2. ""lug bluf wif"" translates to ""blue blue red."" ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which is blue, so ""bluf"" repeats blue.

3. ""dax walm wif bluf"" translates to ""green green green red red."" ""wif"" is red, and ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" hence ""bluf"" repeats red.

4. ""wif bluf dax lug"" translates to ""red red green blue."" ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" which is red, so ""bluf"" is red.

5. ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow."" Here ""bluf"" is yellow, following the pattern after ""zup.""

Rule: ""bluf"" -> repeats the color of the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" takes the following rule:

walm -> The color word that repeats three times and matches the color word that preceded ""walm""

Rule: If ""walm"" follows a color word like ""lug"" (blue), ""zup"" (yellow), or ""dax"" (green), the output is three repetitions of the corresponding color word. If ""walm"" is preceded by more than one color word, then only the color word immediately preceding ""walm"" is repeated three times.

Illustrative Examples:
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- ""zup wif walm lug"" results in ""yellow red red red blue"" because ""wif"" is not associated with a color, thus ""walm"" causes the immediately preceding word ""wif"" to output as ""red"" three times, followed by the color corresponding to ""lug"", which is blue.
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""dax walm zup lug"" results in ""green green green yellow blue"" because ""walm"" makes ""dax"" (green) repeat three times, followed by ""zup"" giving yellow and ""lug"" giving blue.
- ""lug walm"" again results in ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to blue.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be formalized as:
Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color-indicating word, it causes that color word to repeat three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the outputs.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each instance of the word ""dax"" in the input correlates with ""green"" in the output. Consequently, ""bluf"" seems to correlate with ""green"" as well, ""lug"" with ""blue,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow."" 

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce what ""wif"" means, let's analyze the relationship between the input and output sequences.

For ""wif bluf"" the output is ""red red"". Both words in the input result in ""red"" in the output. Therefore, if ""bluf"" were to have a one-to-one relationship with ""red"", then ""wif"" could potentially also mean ""red"".

For ""wif zup dax bluf"", the output is ""red yellow green green"". If we hold onto our initial conclusion that ""bluf"" correlates with \""red\"" and now see it correlating with ""green"", it appears there is no one-to-one word-color correlation for ""bluf"". Also, ""wif"" results in ""red"" again here, suggesting it consistently corresponds to ""red"".

For ""dax walm wif"", the output is ""green green green red"". We have ""wif"" at the end, directly translating to ""red"", further reinforcing that ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red"".

For ""wif dax lug dax"", the output is ""red green blue green"". Here ""wif"" is ""red"" once more, and ""dax"" appears to have different outputs (""green"" and ""blue""), indicating that the meaning of ""dax"" might vary based on its position or other words in the sequence.

For ""zup wif"", the output is ""yellow red"". ""Wif"" is again corresponding with ""red"". Since this is consistent across all examples, it supports the idea that ""wif"" translates directly to ""red"".

Based on the evidence, it seems that ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red"", regardless of its position or the presence of other words.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""zup"" correlates with the word ""yellow"" in the outputs each time it appears. Regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence, the output always contains ""yellow"" in the corresponding position. Here are the observed mappings:

- ""wif"" seems to correlate with ""red""
- ""lug"" seems to correlate with ""blue""
- ""dax"" seems to correlate with ""green""
- ""walm"" seems to correlate with ""yellow"" as well (note ""wif walm zup"" results in ""red red red yellow"", suggesting ""walm"" might correspond to additional instances of ""yellow"", but ""zup"" is specifically one instance of ""yellow"")

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" appears to be:

zup -> yellow
From the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" causes the output color to repeat the color that was output just before it. Here is how the rule applies to each example:

- Input: dax bluf | Output: green green
The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and the presence of ""bluf"" after it repeats that color.

- Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif | Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
The word ""lug"" corresponds to blue, followed by ""bluf"", which repeats the blue. Then ""zup"" gives yellow, ""bluf"" repeats yellow, and ""wif"" ends with red.

- Input: dax zup bluf | Output: green yellow yellow
The word ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, followed by ""bluf"", which repeats the yellow after ""zup"".

- Input: lug bluf wif | Output: blue blue red
The word ""lug"" corresponds to blue, followed by ""bluf"", which repeats blue, and ""wif"" ends the sequence with red.

- Input: dax wif bluf | Output: green red red
The word ""wif"" corresponds to red, followed by ""bluf"", which repeats the red color after ""wif"".

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color output just before it.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can analyze the sequences provided and compare the inputs with the corresponding outputs. We look for patterns that apply specifically when ""walm"" is introduced. 

In the first input, ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" and before ""wif lug dax walm"" again. The output starts with a series of three greens followed by red, suggesting that ""dax walm"" may translate to ""green green"". The sequence ends with ""green green green"", echoing the start, once again following ""dax walm."" This suggests a repetition rule.

In the second input, ""walm"" is between ""zup"" and ""lug zup wif dax."" The corresponding output colors shift from three yellows to blue, and then to a single yellow and red green, so there's not a clear pattern solely from this input.

The third input features ""wif zup walm dax zup,"" and the output changes from red, two yellows to green, yellow. Notably, when ""zup"" is next, the color yellow is consistently present, except where ""walm"" is used.

In the fourth input, ""walm"" appears between ""wif"" and ""dax zup."" Both ""wif"" and ""dax"" relate to red and green in the outputs, but the presence of ""walm"" changes the sequence to two reds and a green, suggesting a transformation effect by ""walm.""

The fifth input has ""walm"" after ""dax"" and followed by ""zup."" The output pattern changes at ""walm"" from red and green to a sequence of greens and a yellow, which again seems to signify a transformation or continuation.

Given these observations, we can see a pattern that ""walm"" tends to influence the sequence that follows it by either repeating a certain color sequence or altering it significantly.

""Walm"" seems to be functioning as a modifier that affects the color output right after its occurrence, potentially replicating the color immediately before it or causing a string of repeated colors. However, the exact rule is not entirely clear given the variability in the associated outputs.

Based on the patterns observed, we could conceive a tentative rule that ""walm"" replicates or sustains the output color pattern that precedes it. However, this rule isn't consistent across all examples and does not account for all the changes observed, particularly when considering the second input.

Therefore, we need more data to come up with a definitive rule. With the limited examples provided, the best we have is a partial rule:

Rule: ""walm"" seems to induce a repeating color sequence in the output, but the specifics of this effect are not clearly defined in every case.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,55
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the output includes the color ""blue.""
Rule: dax -> green

Each instance of the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs provided.
To analyze the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"", let's take a closer look at the consistent patterns evident in the given examples.

1. In the first example, ""wif"" is followed by ""dax"" which correlates with the transition from red to green in the output. However, ""dax"" is also present before ""wif"" and the output again transitions from green to red. The position of ""wif"" here does not change the color associated with ""dax"".

2. The second example also shows ""wif"" preceding ""dax"" and the color red preceding the color green. ""wif"" comes after ""lug,"" and the color red follows blue, but this might not be related.

3. The third example has ""wif"" followed by nothing but connected with the output red. This suggests that ""wif"" by itself corresponds to red.

4. Similarly, in the fourth example, ""wif"" is again followed by nothing and the output is red. This example also reinforces the idea that ""wif"" itself corresponds to red.

5. The fifth example supports this as well, as ""wif"" appears at the start and is translated directly to red, followed by colors that match the words ""lug"" and ""bluf"" from previous examples.

Based on these observations, regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input, the output color is red. This suggests the rule that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can infer a one-to-one relationship between each input word and its output color. In every instance, the word ""zup"" consistently results in the output ""yellow."" There doesn't seem to be a dependency on its position in the input sequence; ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow,"" regardless of where it appears.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

zup -> yellow

Meaning: When the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the output is the color ""yellow.""
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to involve the word ""bluf"" always translating to the same color as the word preceding it. Here are the deductions as per each example:

1. zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue
The word ""bluf"" follows the word ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" also translates to ""yellow.""

2. dax bluf -> green green
The word ""bluf"" follows the word ""dax,"" which translates to ""green,"" so ""bluf"" also translates to ""green.""

3. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
The word ""bluf"" follows the word ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" also translates to ""yellow.""

4. dax bluf wif zup wif -> green green red yellow red
The word ""bluf"" follows the word ""dax,"" which translates to ""green,"" so ""bluf"" also translates to ""green.""

5. wif lug bluf wif zup -> red blue blue red yellow
The word ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" also translates to ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word that immediately precedes it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the examples given and look for a pattern.

In the first example, the output sequence ends with ""blue blue blue yellow"" and the input sequence ends with ""lug walm zup."" Here ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" seems to cause the previous color (""blue"" from ""lug"") to repeat before then changing to ""yellow"" corresponding to ""zup.""

In the second example, we have an output of ""blue blue blue green"" corresponding to ""lug walm dax"". Again, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes a repetition of ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

In the third example, the output ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"" corresponds to ""zup bluf lug zup walm."" We don't know what ""bluf"" corresponds to, but it does not seem related to ""walm."" After ""lug"" (""blue""), ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is followed by ""walm,"" which leads to a repetition of ""yellow.""

In the fourth and fifth examples, we see that after ""lug"" and ""dax"" (which corresponds to ""blue"" and ""green"" respectively), ""walm"" causes a repetition of the previous color before the sequence changes.

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the previous color to be repeated once more in the sequence, regardless of what that color is. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> repeat the previous color in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax walm lug
    ",Output: yellow green green blue,yellow green green green blue,False,56
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the outputs provided. Every instance where ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output.
Rule: dax -> green

Every instance of the word ""dax"" in the input corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output.
wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red"".
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to a color in the output, but the color it corresponds to depends on the position of ""zup"" and the colors or words adjacent to it. Let's analyze the instances:

1. In the first example, ""zup"" appears twice:
   - When ""zup"" is at the beginning and followed by ""dax lug walm zup,"" the output is ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow."" Here, the presence of ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"" both at the beginning and at the end.
   
2. In the second example, ""zup"" is second in sequence and is followed immediately by ""wif bluf lug."" The output is ""green yellow red red blue,"" with ""yellow"" corresponding to the position of ""zup"" in the sequence.

3. In the third example, ""zup"" is the first word and is followed by ""bluf dax,"" yielding the output ""yellow yellow green."" Once again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

4. In the fourth example, ""zup"" appears in the middle of the sequence with a ""wif"" after it, and the output is ""blue red yellow red red red."" ""Zup"" aligns with ""yellow"" in the output, but the repetition of ""red"" at the end seems anomalous and might be due to the presence of ""walm,"" which apparently corresponds to multiple ""reds.""

5. In the last example, ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" and the entire output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" with ""zup"" first in sequence connecting with ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, the common rule appears to be that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" but the conditions of adjacent words and their corresponding colors in the output are not entirely clear as the examples only show the output as consistently ""yellow"" when ""zup"" is used.

Rule: zup -> yellow

However, without further examples or a clearer pattern of interaction with the other words (""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" ""bluf""), this rule cannot fully explain the color repetitions or the conditions under which they occur. Hence, the rule that can be confidently induced from the given examples is that the use of ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" at that specific position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" with the exception of the case where ""bluf"" is directly followed by ""lug."" In that specific context, ""bluf lug"" translates to ""blue blue.""

Rule: bluf -> ""yellow"", except when followed directly by ""lug"", where bluf lug -> ""blue blue"".
Based on the examples, we can infer that each input word corresponds to a color in the output. The word 'dax' consistently corresponds to 'green', and 'wif' corresponds to 'red'. When the word 'walm' appears after 'dax', the output is a repetition of 'green' followed by a 'red'. When 'walm' appears at the end of a sequence after 'zup', it results in repeating the color associated with 'zup' ('yellow' in this case).

Let's look at each example:

1. Input: dax walm wif
   - 'dax' -> 'green'
   - 'walm' -> repeated 'green'
   - 'wif' -> 'red'
   Output: green green green red

2. Input: wif dax zup walm
   - 'wif' -> 'red'
   - 'dax' -> 'green'
   - 'zup' -> 'yellow'
   - 'walm' -> repeated 'yellow' (after 'zup')
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

3. Input: dax walm
   - 'dax' -> 'green'
   - 'walm' -> repeated 'green'
   Output: green green green

4. Input: dax zup walm wif
   - 'dax' -> 'green'
   - 'zup' -> 'yellow'
   - 'walm' -> repeated 'yellow' (after 'zup')
   - 'wif' -> 'red'
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

5. Input: dax walm
   - 'dax' -> 'green'
   - 'walm' -> repeated 'green'
   Output: green green green

Therefore, the rule for 'walm' seems to be: when it follows 'dax', it repeats the output for 'dax'. When it follows 'zup', it repeats the output for 'zup'. It could be that 'walm' causes the previous color to be repeated with 'green' being the default if 'walm' is the second word. If 'walm' comes at the end of an input, the same logic applies, with the preceding color being repeated until the end of the output, before 'wif' which turns it to 'red'.

Based on this analysis, the rule can be summarized as follows:

Rule: When 'walm' follows 'dax', it repeats the output color for 'dax' ('green'). When 'walm' follows 'zup', it repeats the output color for 'zup' ('yellow'). When 'walm' is followed by 'wif', it ends with 'red'.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax bluf wif
    ",Output: green yellow red,green green red,False,57
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in each example provided. Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, it is translated to ""blue"" in the output.
Rule: dax -> green

The given examples show a consistent direct mapping between the nonce word ""dax"" and the color ""green"" in the output. Every time ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. This rule is supported by each provided example, regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence.
From the examples provided, we can try to deduce the pattern for what ""wif"" translates to. Let's examine each input/output pair:

Input: lug wif zup wif walm
Output: blue red yellow red red red
- Observation: ""wif"" appears after ""lug"" and ""zup,"" and in both instances, the word directly after ""wif"" is ""red.""

Input: wif dax wif lug wif
Output: red green red blue red
- Observation: ""wif"" appears at the beginning, between ""dax"" and ""lug,"" and at the end, all of which have ""red"" after ""wif.""

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue
- Observation: ""wif"" appears before ""lug"" which has ""blue"" as the output after ""wif.” Yet, ""red"" is still present after ""wif.""

Input: wif
Output: red
- Observation: ""wif"" on its own is translated to ""red.""

Input: dax bluf wif
Output: green green red
- Observation: ""wif"" comes after ""bluf"" and it is translated to ""red.""

Putting it all together, it appears that the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red."" Therefore, the rule can be inferred as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" let's examine how it is used in various inputs and the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax 
   Output: red red yellow red blue green
   (""zup"" follows ""bluf"" and precedes ""wif""; its output is ""yellow"".)

2. Input: zup dax lug walm zup 
   Output: yellow green blue blue yellow 
   (""zup"" starts and ends the sequence here, with corresponding ""yellow"" at both positions.)

3. Input: zup bluf wif bluf 
   Output: yellow yellow red red
   (""zup"" precedes ""bluf""; its output is ""yellow"".)

4. Input: dax zup 
   Output: green yellow
   (""zup"" follows ""dax""; its output is ""yellow"".)

5. Input: lug zup 
   Output: blue yellow
   (""zup"" follows ""lug""; its output is ""yellow"".)

In every instance where ""zup"" appears, regardless of the position or the terms it is associated with, the corresponding output is ""yellow"". There does not seem to be a conditional aspect impacting the translation of ""zup"". Therefore, we can conclude that ""zup"" translates directly to ""yellow"" consistently.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: The word ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Examples:
- Input: ""dax zup lug bluf"" translates to Output: ""green yellow blue blue"" (Here, ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""lug,"" which is ""blue"".)
- Input: ""wif bluf"" translates to Output: ""red red"" (Here, ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""wif,"" which is ""red"".)
- Input: ""wif zup dax bluf"" translates to Output: ""red yellow green green"" (Here, ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""dax,"" which is ""green"".)
- Input: ""zup bluf dax lug"" translates to Output: ""yellow yellow green blue"" (Here, ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""zup,"" which is ""yellow"".)
- Input: ""dax bluf zup bluf dax"" translates to Output: ""green green yellow yellow green"" (Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and ""zup,"" repeating their colors respectively.)

Therefore,
bluf -> meaning: Repeats the color of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can analyze the patterns evident in each input-output pair:

1. When ""dax walm"" is an input, the output is ""green green green.""
2. The input ""zup walm"" results in the output ""yellow yellow yellow.""
3. ""wif walm dax"" produces the output ""red red red green.""
4. The input ""lug walm"" renders the output ""blue blue blue.""
5. Lastly, ""wif lug walm"" correlates with the output ""red blue blue blue.""

By examining the outputs associated with each input that contains ""walm,"" we see a repetition of a color word three times, except in the case where ""walm"" is followed by another word. This repetition suggests that ""walm"" signifies the repetition of the color word corresponding to the word preceding ""walm.""

Let's assess the case where ""walm"" is followed by a word:
- Input: ""wif walm dax"" results in ""red red red green,""
  which means ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""walm"" signifies repeating ""red"" three times, and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Thus, we can deduce that ""walm"" signifies repeating the color that corresponds to the word before ""walm"" three times, but when followed by another word, ""walm"" does not influence the color corresponding to the following word.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word before walm three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug wif
    ",Output: green blue red,green blue red,True,58
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Each occurrence of ""lug"" in the input is translated to ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color red.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow"" and each additional word after ""zup"" corresponds to an additional color word, following a specific sequence. When only ""zup"" is present, the output is exclusively ""yellow."" When the word ""wif"" is added, the word ""red"" is added to the output. The presence of the word ""walm"" produces repetitions of the word ""yellow"" in the output, with each instance of ""walm"" adding one more ""yellow."" The word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the color ""red"" in the output, similar to ""wif.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be as follows:

Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" the word ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" the word ""walm"" adds an additional ""yellow"" for each occurrence before ""wif,"" and ""bluf"" translates to ""red."" The specific color words are added to the output in the order they appear relative to ""zup.""
Rule: The word ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Observing the inputs and outputs:

1. ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"", which implies ""bluf"" takes on the color of ""wif"" (red).
2. When ""zup bluf"" occurs, the result is ""yellow yellow"", again showing that ""bluf"" takes on the color of ""zup"" (yellow).
3. In ""lug wif bluf"", the output is ""blue red red"", indicating ""bluf"" takes on the color of ""wif"" (red).
4. ""wif bluf lug"" outputs ""red red blue"", once more showing ""bluf"" takes on the color of ""wif"" (red).
5. With ""dax bluf"", the output is ""green green"", which suggests ""bluf"" takes on the color of ""dax"" (green).

So, bluf -> meaning. Meaning: Bluf takes on the color associated with the word that comes directly before it in a sequence.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the presence of the word ""walm"" results in a sequence of the word ""green"" being repeated until a new word is introduced. Here is the breakdown:

1. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red
- ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and before ""wif"" signals the word ""green"" to be repeated three times until ""wif"" changes the color to red.

2. dax wif walm lug zup -> green red red red blue yellow
- ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" and ""wif"" and is followed by ""lug"" without affecting the output of ""dax"" and ""wif"", but after ""walm"", ""lug"" generates three reds, indicating that the ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color that follows.

3. dax walm -> green green green
- ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and extends the color green associated with ""dax"" in repeated fashion.

4. lug walm wif lug -> blue blue blue red blue
- ""walm"" occurs after ""lug"" and results in ""lug's"" color, blue, being repeated.

5. wif dax lug walm -> red green blue blue blue
- ""walm"" at the end of the sequence causes the color corresponding to ""lug"" to repeat.

Rule: ""walm"" does not have its own color output but instead causes the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it to repeat until a new word is introduced.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" translates consistently to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. The rule can therefore be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following:

- Every time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Here are the given examples with this rule applied:

Input: lug walm zup lug walm
Output: blue blue yellow blue blue blue
Analysis: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
Analysis: Both instances of ""zup"" correspond to ""yellow""

Input: zup
Output: yellow
Analysis: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax
Output: green green yellow yellow green
Analysis: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Using the examples above, we can safely deduce that:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the instances in which the word appears and the corresponding outputs. Let's look for patterns:

1. ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue""
2. ""dax bluf wif lug"" -> ""green green red blue""
3. ""dax wif bluf"" -> ""green red red""
4. ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue""
5. ""dax lug wif bluf"" -> ""green blue red red""

By analyzing the patterns, it seems that ""bluf"" causes the following word to repeat the color given to the last word that appears before ""bluf"". Let's verify this pattern:

1. ""bluf lug"" -> ""blue blue"" - ""lug"" is blue both times after ""bluf.""
2. ""bluf wif"" -> ""red blue"" - ""wif"" is red following ""bluf.""
3. ""bluf"" alone caused ""wif"" to repeat red, which was the color assigned to it just before ""bluf.""
4. ""bluf lug"" -> ""yellow blue"" - ""lug"" is again blue after ""bluf,"" following the yellow ""zup.""
5. ""bluf"" caused ""wif"" to repeat red, the color assigned to it just before ""bluf.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it causes the subsequent word to take on the color of the word immediately preceding ""bluf"".

Rule: bluf -> causes the next color to repeat the color of the previous word.
Based on the examples provided, we can try to discern a pattern that helps us understand what ""walm"" might mean. Let's examine each input and its corresponding output:

1. lug dax walm wif -> blue green green green red
2. wif dax zup walm -> red green yellow yellow yellow
3. lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue
4. dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue blue yellow red
5. zup dax walm lug wif -> yellow green green green blue red

Looking at the inputs and outputs, ""walm"" is associated with a repetition of the color that comes right before it. For example:

- In 1st input, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which outputs ""green"", so ""walm"" manifests as ""green"" repeated until the next word.
- In 2nd input, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which outputs ""yellow"", so ""walm"" leads to ""yellow"" repeated.
- In 3rd input, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" as well, resulting in ""yellow"" repeated.
- In 4th input, ""walm"" follows ""lug"", leads to the color ""blue"" being repeated.
- In 5th input, ""walm"" follows ""dax"", resulting in the color ""green"" repeated.

Each occurrence of ""walm"" is immediately followed by the repetition of the previously mentioned color until a new color word is introduced.

Rule: walm -> Causes the repetition of the previously mentioned color's output until the next color word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"", regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it.

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: In each example, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we will observe its corresponding output in each example. 

1. Input: ""wif lug zup bluf"" -> Output: ""red blue yellow yellow""
2. Input: ""wif bluf lug zup"" -> Output: ""red red blue yellow""
3. Input: ""zup dax bluf zup dax"" -> Output: ""yellow green green yellow green""
4. Input: ""wif bluf lug zup"" -> Output: ""red red blue yellow""
5. Input: ""zup bluf lug zup"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow blue yellow""

Through these examples, we can observe the following:

- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red.""
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""

Looking specifically at ""bluf:""

- In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" while the word preceding it ""zup"" also corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" and is preceded by ""wif,"" which also corresponds to ""red.""
- The third example contains ""bluf"" corresponding to ""green"" and is preceded by ""dax,"" which also corresponds to ""green.""
- In the fourth example, like the second, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" and is preceded by ""wif.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" preceded by ""zup.""

From these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word that immediately precedes it. It is a placeholder for repetition of the previous color mentioned.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word before it.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to be directly influencing the color output immediately after its occurrence. Each instance of ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the same color, three times, which corresponds to the previous color word:

1. lug walm zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow red
   - ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times.

2. lug walm -> blue blue blue
   - Again, ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times.

3. dax walm -> green green green
   - ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times.

4. wif walm zup lug zup walm -> red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times.
   - The second occurrence of ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which led to ""yellow,"" and so ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times.

5. lug dax zup dax walm wif -> blue green yellow green green green red
   - ""dax"" before ""walm"" leads to ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times.

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word directly before ""walm"" three times.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following associations:

- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"".
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"".
- ""lug"" appears between other color words, and when following ""zup"" or ""dax"", ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".

From the examples, we can deduce a rule for ""lug"" assuming consistency in its translation based on the context given:

Rule: lug -> ""blue""
Rule: dax -> green

Justification: In each example, whenever the word ""dax"" is present in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. No matter the position of ""dax"" in the input, ""green"" is the consistent output.

- Input: dax zup => Output: green yellow (dax corresponds to green)
- Input: zup dax wif => Output: yellow green red (dax corresponds to green)
- Input: dax bluf zup => Output: green green yellow (dax corresponds to green)
- Input: wif zup wif dax => Output: red yellow red green (dax corresponds to green)
- Input: zup lug dax => Output: yellow blue green (dax corresponds to green)
Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"". 

So, wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of context within the given examples.
Based on the examples given:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red.""
- When ""zup"" and ""wif"" precede ""bluf,"" the output includes ""yellow red red,"" suggesting ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and does not affect ""bluf,"" which remains ""red red.""
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""zup bluf lug walm,"" the output is ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""zup"" still translates to ""yellow."" The ""bluf"" maintains the ""red red"" pattern.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" which is followed by ""wif lug zup,"" the output is ""green green red blue yellow,"" suggesting that ""dax"" translates to ""green green"" and does not influence ""bluf"" since ""bluf"" is still generating a double color as in past instances.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" with no other words following, the output is ""green green,"" showing that ""bluf"" doesn't depend on the presence of another word after it to maintain the output of a double color.

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to a double of the color word that would correspond to the word that precedes ""bluf."" In other words, ""bluf"" causes the output color word to be repeated twice.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" influences the color pattern output, with each occurrence of ""walm"" resulting in three repetitions of the same color. Analyzing each input and corresponding output:

1. Input: ""zup walm wif""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow red""
   - ""zup"" might correspond to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" might correspond to ""red."" ""walm"" operates to produce three ""yellow"" before ""red,"" indicating ""walm"" could be related to triplicating the color associated with the word before it.

2. Input: ""wif walm dax""
   Output: ""red red red green""
   - In this instance, ""wif"" could correspond to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" Again, ""walm"" precedes three instances of ""red,"" reinforcing the idea that it could cause a triplication effect.

3. Input: ""dax wif walm""
   Output: ""green red red red""
   - With ""dax"" first, the color ""green"" is output, followed by ""wif,"" which aligns with ""red."" The ""walm"" after ""wif"" once again results in the triplication of ""red.""

4. Input: ""dax walm zup lug""
   Output: ""green green green yellow blue""
   - In this sequence, ""dax"" corresponds to a single ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" there are three ""green."" ""zup"" follows and switches to ""yellow,"" and ""lug,"" which has not been previously defined, corresponds to ""blue.""

5. Input: ""dax walm""
   Output: ""green green green""
   - Finally, with no word following ""walm,"" it still induces a triplication of the color associated with ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

Considering the consistent repetition of the color associated with the word preceding ""walm,"" the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm causes the color corresponding to the word before it to be repeated three times in the output.

Thus, the meaning of ""walm"" could be abstracted as:

walm -> Triplicates the color associated with the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,62
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" seems to correspond to the color ""blue."" Let's examine the instances where ""lug"" appears to confirm this:

- In the first example, ""lug"" precedes ""zup,"" and the output is ""blue yellow.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""wif,"" with the output being ""yellow blue red.""
- In the third example, ""lug"" is between two ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow blue yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" is at the end after ""dax,"" and the output sequence ends with ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, there are two instances of ""lug,"" each following a ""zup,"" and the corresponding output is ""yellow blue.""

From these examples, it is apparent that each time ""lug"" is used, the corresponding output color is ""blue."" It does not seem to matter where ""lug"" occurs in the sequence; it consistently corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we will need to examine the patterns and correlations between the presence of ""dax"" in the inputs and the corresponding outputs.

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red
- ""dax"" correlates with the first ""green"" in the output.

Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
Output: green green red yellow red
- ""dax"" is again correlated with the first ""green"" in the output.

Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
- Here, ""dax"" appears later in the input sequence, and it correlates with the first ""green"" occurring after some other colors.

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
- Once again, the presence of ""dax"" correlates with the first ""green"" in the output, with subsequent colors differing.

Input: dax
Output: green
- The single term ""dax"" correlates with a single ""green"" output.

The rule we can derive is that ""dax"" directly corresponds to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position within the input sequence. It does not depend on the context or the presence of other words.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, we can make an observation about the color that corresponds to each word.

1. Every time ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red.""
2. The color following ""wif"" seems to repeat the color that ""wif"" translates to until a different word is introduced.
3. When a new word is introduced, it changes the output color and again repeats that color output until another new word is introduced.

So, taking the first example:
- ""wif"" outputs ""red.""
- ""zup"" follows ""wif"" and changes the output to ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" doesn't appear in the output, which suggests that it might not influence the color change but could be a filler or null word that isn't assigned a direct output color. However, since it's followed by ""lug,"" which outputs ""blue"" and is repeated, ""bluf"" might serve to maintain the current color, ""yellow,"" for one more instance before ""lug"" changes it.
- ""lug"" outputs ""blue.""
- ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and doesn't change the color output, indicating that ""walm"" might also mean ""red.""
- ""dax"" follows ""walm"" and changes the output to ""green.""

If we apply this reasoning to the other examples:

2. ""wif walm zup"" produces ""red red red yellow.""
3. ""zup wif walm lug"" produces ""yellow red red red blue.""
4. ""wif"" alone produces ""red.""
5. ""dax walm wif"" produces ""green green green red.""

This consistent pattern points to a rule: the word ""wif"" always results in the color ""red"" and causes the following words to repeat the output of ""red"" until a new word that corresponds to a different color is introduced. The word following ""wif"" does not change the color unless it is inherently associated with a different color (like ""dax"" or ""zup"").

Rule: wif -> red. When ""wif"" appears, it outputs ""red,"" and the output remains ""red"" for subsequent words until a word with its own color association is introduced.
Based on the provided examples, we see that each word seems to correspond to a specific color: ""zup"" to yellow, ""wif"" to red, ""lug"" to blue, and ""walm"" to blue as well. It's also noteworthy that the number of repetitions for the corresponding color seems to match the position of the word within the sequence. For example, ""lug walm zup walm"" translates to one blue, one blue, and then two yellows, as ""zup"" is the third word in the sequence.

Here's a breakdown of how that works with the given examples:
- ""zup"" on its own produces ""yellow"".
- ""zup wif"" produces ""yellow red"" as ""wif"" is the second word.
- ""lug walm zup walm"" has ""lug"" and ""walm"" before ""zup,"" so when ""zup"" appears as the third word, it produces two yellows.
- ""wif walm zup"" has ""wif"" and ""walm"" before ""zup,"" making ""zup"" again translate to two yellows because it's the third word.
- ""zup wif walm lug"" starts with ""zup,"" resulting in one yellow, followed by ""wif"" which is the second word producing two reds, ""walm"" as the third word producing three reds, and ""lug"" as the fourth word producing four blues.

Using these observations, the rule seems to be that each instance of the word ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow"" and the number of times ""yellow"" is mentioned is based on the placement of ""zup"" in the sequence - the first position yields one yellow, the second yields two yellows, and so on.

Rule: zup -> yellow, with the number of repetitions equal to the position of ""zup"" in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" makes the output repeat the color associated with the word that directly precedes it. Here is the breakdown:

- ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red"", which suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red and ""bluf"" is causing it to repeat.
- ""lug bluf wif"" outputs ""blue blue red"", indicating ""lug"" corresponds to blue, which is then repeated because of ""bluf"", and ""wif"" corresponds to red, not affected by ""bluf"" because it follows it.
- ""zup bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow"", meaning ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""bluf"" repeats it.
- The repetition of ""zup bluf"" provides the same output ""yellow yellow"", further supporting the rule.
- ""dax bluf wif lug zup"" outputs ""green green red blue yellow"". Here, ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"", thus ""dax"" corresponds to green and is repeated; ""wif"" follows and is not repeated, giving red; ""lug"" gives blue and ""zup"" yellow without repetition as they are not preceded by ""bluf"".

Rule: bluf -> causes the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in each input with their corresponding outputs.

- In the first example ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug,"" we see that ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" isn't used in the outputs, ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""dax"" with ""green."" The word ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" (blue), and after ""walm,"" the output repeats the color of the most recent word until a new color is introduced, so ""walm"" here seems to cause repetition of the preceding color.
  
- In the second example ""dax walm,"" we have ""green green green,"" which means ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to ""dax"" (green) as no other colors are presented.

- In the third example ""zup lug walm,"" the output ""yellow blue blue blue"" suggests that after ""lug"" (blue), ""walm"" again causes a repetition of the color blue.

- In the fourth example ""zup wif walm lug,"" the output ""yellow red red red blue"" indicates that after ""wif"" (red), ""walm"" causes the repetition of red until a new word with an assigned color (""lug,"" which is blue) is presented.

- In the fifth example ""dax walm lug,"" the output ""green green green blue"" shows the same pattern of ""walm"" inducing the repetition of ""dax"" (green) until ""lug"" (blue) appears.

Based on the examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the most recent color in the sequence until a new color word is introduced.

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the last mentioned color until a new color word is introduced.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to look at each example and find the commonality each time the word ""dax"" is used.

Looking at the examples:

- dax walm -> green green green (With two words, one being ""dax,"" ""green"" appears three times, suggesting repetition, although ""walm"" does not appear in any other examples to compare its effect. We'll need to look at other examples.)
- zup dax bluf -> yellow green green (The word ""dax"" results in ""green"" again, which is consistent with the first example. ""zup"" and ""bluf"" change the output to ""yellow"" and ""green,"" but ""green"" is consistent for ""dax."")
- dax lug dax wif dax -> green blue green red green (Every time ""dax"" appears, ""green"" is the result. This is consistent with the first two examples. The other words lead to different colors, but ""dax"" consistently results in ""green."")
- zup bluf wif dax lug -> yellow yellow red green blue (Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" which is consistent across all examples.)
- dax lug -> green blue (Once more, ""dax"" results in ""green."")

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds with the output ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input or the other words present.

dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word wif appears to correlate with the color red in the output each time it is present in the input. This translation appears to be consistent across all examples and does not seem to depend on the position of ""wif"" within the sequence or on the adjacent words. Thus, we can induce that ""wif"" represents the color red.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rules:

1. The presence of ""zup"" always leads to the output starting with ""yellow.""
2. Each subsequent word after ""zup"" seems to correspond to a specific color:
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
3. When multiple words follow ""zup,"" their corresponding colors are listed in the output in the same order.

Therefore, the rule can be described as follows:

zup -> always outputs ""yellow"" at the beginning.
Each word following ""zup"" corresponds to a specific predetermined color output.

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" is present, the output will start with ""yellow"" followed by the colors associated with each subsequent word in the order they appear.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" generates a duplicate color of the word that follows it.

Examples:

1. ""zup bluf wif walm"" produced ""yellow yellow red red red"". Here, the word following ""bluf"" was ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color red, and ""bluf"" resulted in an additional red being produced.

2. ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" resulted in ""green green red yellow blue"". Here, ""wif"" comes after ""bluf"" and is red, so ""bluf"" results in an additional red.

3. ""wif bluf"" led to ""red red"". Following this pattern, ""bluf"" duplicates the red that comes from ""wif.""

4. ""lug dax bluf wif dax"" gave us ""blue green green red green"". Again, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" so it generates an extra red.

5. ""lug wif lug bluf"" resulted in ""blue red blue blue"". The word ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to blue, so it results in an additional blue.

bluf -> meaning. The word ""bluf"" causes the color of the word that immediately follows it to be duplicated in the output sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let us examine the given examples and their corresponding outputs closely:

1. Input: ""zup walm lug zup wif dax""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green""
   
2. Input: ""zup walm dax lug""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow green blue""
   
3. Input: ""lug wif walm""
   Output: ""blue red red red""
   
4. Input: ""zup walm lug""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow blue""
   
5. Input: ""dax zup walm wif walm""
   Output: ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red""

Let's analyze the inputs and outputs to figure out the pattern.

In every example, the word ""walm"" seems to always result in additional repetitions of the color corresponding to the word that follows ""walm."" The word before ""walm"" does not appear to have an impact on this repetition.

Using that logic, let's break down the examples:

1. After ""walm,"" the word ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and we see an extra yellow before the blue, suggesting that ""walm"" results in repeating the color before the target word (lug -> blue).
   
2. The same happens with ""dax"" following ""walm,"" resulting in an additional yellow before the output color green that corresponds to ""dax.""
   
3. When ""walm"" is last and only followed by ""lug,"" repeating the color red that corresponds to ""wif"" found before ""walm."" So ""walm"" still results in additional repetitions of the color preceding its occurrence.
   
4. Only ""zup"" and ""lug"" color outputs are involved (yellow and blue), indicating the same pattern of repetition due to ""walm.""
   
5. The word ""walm"" is present twice. In both cases, the word that follows is ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color red, and ""walm"" results in additional reds being added to the output.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color corresponding to the word following it, making that color appear an extra time in the pattern.

Rule: walm -> causes repetition of the color corresponding to the word that follows ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    ",Output: blue green red red,blue green red red,True,64
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the following rule can be induced:

Rule: lug -> blue

Whenever ""lug"" appears as part of the input, the corresponding output is ""blue.""
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in every example given.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the output, irrespective of its position within the input sequence or the other words present.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each word is assigned a specific color. The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" is the following:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, ""bluf"" consistently results in the output being a repeated color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" Here's how ""bluf"" functions in the given examples:

- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"": ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""dax,"" which is green.
- ""wif bluf zup"" -> ""red red yellow"": ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""wif,"" which is red.
- ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" -> ""green green red yellow red"": ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""dax,"" which is green, and the rest follows their respective color associations.
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"": Again, ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""wif,"" which is red.
- ""dax lug bluf dax"" -> ""green blue blue green"": In this case, ""bluf"" is after ""lug,"" which seems to indicate that ""lug"" does not influence ""bluf,"" and the color repeat rule for ""bluf"" still depends on ""dax"" which is the first word, and its color is green.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color of the word immediately before it.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at how it affects the output in each given instance:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red"":
   Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue

2. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output adds an extra ""blue"" compared to when ""lug"" is used without ""walm"":
   Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

3. ""Walm"" on its own after ""zup"" results in three ""yellow"":
   Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

4. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" there is no extra ""green,"" but the sequence ends with an additional ""yellow"" compared to when ""dax"" appears alone:
   Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red

5. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" again, the output is three times ""red"":
   Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

Based on these examples, ""walm"" seems to extend the color associated with the previous word; it causes the preceding color word to be repeated. If ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, it adds one more repetition of the last color mentioned. Here is the observed rule based on each example:

- ""wif"" corresponds to red, and when ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it repeats ""red"" (3 times in total).
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" repeats that color (3 times in total when alone).
- ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" increases the count of ""blue.""
- There is no direct output for ""walm"" after ""dax,"" but the pattern seems to indicate that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the previous word or sequence.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color associated with the previous word. If ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence, it extends the last mentioned color by one more repetition.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the outputs given.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in all provided examples.
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in all given examples.
Based on the examples provided, ""zup"" appears to correspond to the color yellow. However, there seems to be an additional rule that when ""zup"" appears, the following word's associated color is also repeated until a new color (or ""zup"") appears. 

Here's the breakdown:

- Example 1: ""wif"" leads to red, followed by ""zup"" which is yellow, and then ""walm"" would be red, but it is repeated three times because it follows ""zup"".
- Example 2: ""lug"" is blue, ""zup"" is yellow, and then ""lug"" is blue again (no repetition as it is the same color that preceded ""zup"").
- Example 3: ""lug"" is blue, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""walm"" would be yellow, but it is repeated three times (here both ""zup"" and ""walm"" appear to generate yellow, but ""walm"" is influenced by the presence of ""zup"").
- Example 4: ""dax"" is green, ""walm"" is green, and ""zup"" is yellow with no further repetition (as ""zup"" is the last word).
- Example 5: ""wif"" is red, ""zup"" is yellow, ""bluf"" would be blue, but it's repeated twice because it follows ""zup"", ""lug"" is blue but not repeated (as it is the same color that preceded it), and ""walm"" is blue but repeated once due to following ""bluf"" (though this also follows the pattern that has been deduced).

Rule:
zup -> meaning yellow; when followed by a word representing a different color, the new color is repeated until a different color (or the word ""zup"") appears again.
Rule: bluf -> blue blue

Based on the given examples, every occurrence of the nonce word 'bluf' corresponds to two instances of 'blue' in the output. Here's how it is reflected in the examples:

- Example 1: ""dax bluf wif zup"" translates to ""green green red yellow,"" and since 'dax' corresponds to 'green,' and 'wif' and 'zup' correspond to 'red' and 'yellow' respectively, 'bluf' must correspond to the remaining 'green green,' which in this case we interpret as a repetition of the color 'blue' because 'green' is already taken by 'dax.'
- Example 2: ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" following the same logic 'dax' is 'green' and 'bluf' must be 'blue blue.'
- Example 3: ""dax bluf lug wif"" translates to ""green green blue red,"" 'dax' is 'green,' 'lug' is 'blue,' 'wif' is 'red,' and 'bluf' corresponds to 'blue blue.'
- Example 4: ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue blue,"" 'lug' is 'blue,' 'walm' is 'blue,' 'wif' is 'red,' thus 'bluf' must be 'blue blue' since it adds two 'blue' to the sequence.
- Example 5: ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" translates to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue,"" 'wif' is 'red,' 'zup' is 'yellow,' 'lug' is 'blue,' and 'walm' is 'blue,' hence 'bluf' contributes 'blue blue' to the pattern.

In conclusion, 'bluf' repeatedly produces 'blue blue' in the output.
Rule: walm -> three consecutive green items.

Using the examples provided:

- ""dax walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue blue blue"", where ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" and ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"".
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" becomes ""red red green green green"", with ""dax walm"" translating to ""green green green"".
- ""dax walm"" matches ""green green green"" directly.
- ""zup wif walm lug"" changes to ""yellow red red red blue"", with ""wif walm"" translating to ""red red red"".
- ""lug wif dax walm zup"" turns into ""blue red green green green yellow"", with ""dax walm"" corresponding to ""green green green"".

Hence, in each case, ""walm"" follows a color word and results in that color word being output three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following:

1. ""lug walm"" consistently leads to two blue outputs.
2. ""lug dax"" leads to a blue output followed by a green.
3. ""lug walm zup lug"" leads to blue blue blue yellow blue, indicating that ""lug"" repeated still results in blue outputs.
4. ""lug"" does not seem to change its resultant output color based on what follows or precedes it.

Given these observations, we can deduce that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Thus, the rule we've extracted is:

Rule: lug -> blue
Analyzing the given examples, it seems that for every instance of the nonce word ""dax,"" it gets translated in the output into a color. By comparing the instances of ""dax"" with its corresponding output, we can determine its meaning.

Here are the outcomes next to each instance where ""dax"" is used:

1. wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   - ""dax"" comes before ""lug"" and ""lug"" translates to ""green,"" so ""dax"" should mean ""blue"" since the output color sequence that matches is ""blue blue.""

2. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
   - Here, ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the sequence is ""green blue."" Since we know ""lug"" is ""green,"" ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

3. dax wif -> green red
   - We know ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" meaning ""dax"" must be ""green"" here.

4. wif dax bluf -> red green green
   - ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""bluf"" has translated to ""green"" in the first example where ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"". In this sequence, ""dax"" therefore translates to ""green.""

5. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
   - ""wif"" and ""bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" and following their appearance ""dax"" leads to a ""green"" again and the ""walm"" element which follows ""dax"" also translates to ""green.""

In all instances except the first, ""dax"" translates directly to ""green."" Given the inconsistency in the first instance, it is possible that there is a contextual rule for ""dax's"" meaning. The rule could be related to the position of ""dax"" within the sequence or the words that come just before or after ""dax."" However, with the information provided, the rule isn't entirely clear.

Given that ""dax"" turns into ""green"" in every instance except for the sequence of ""dax lug,"" where it translates to ""blue blue,"" it could be hypothesized that there is a repetition rule involved when ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" or it could be an error in the dataset.

Based on the majority of occurrences, we will deduce that ""dax"" translates to ""green"" in all provided examples except for the potential anomaly in the first example.

Rule: dax -> green
Rule:
wif -> red

Each occurrence of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.
From the examples provided, it appears that each unique word translates to a specific color:

- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue""
- ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""red""

The word ""zup"" is consistently translated to ""yellow"" in each of the provided examples, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, we can observe the appearance of the nonce word ""bluf"" and its corresponding output color. By analyzing each instance, we can attempt to deduce the rule behind the word ""bluf."" 

Let's consider each input where ""bluf"" is present:

1. In example one, ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"".
2. In example two, ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"".
3. In example three, ""bluf"" translates to ""red"".
4. In example four, ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"".
5. In example five, ""bluf"" translates to ""red"".

It appears that ""bluf"" does not correspond to a consistent color in the output. However, we might infer that ""bluf"" translates to the same color as the word that immediately precedes it in the input sequence. To confirm this, let's re-examine the examples:

1. dax zup lug zup **bluf** → green yellow blue yellow **yellow**
2. wif zup **bluf** lug walm dax lug → red yellow **yellow** blue blue blue green blue
3. wif **bluf** lug zup → red **red** blue yellow
4. dax lug **bluf** → green blue **blue**
5. zup wif dax wif **bluf** → yellow red green red **red**

Upon reevaluation, we can see that in every case, the color of ""bluf"" matches the color associated with the word immediately before it in the input.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word immediately preceding it.
Rule: walm -> the color blue, repeating as many times as the word preceding walm.

Observations:
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup"", the output is multiple yellows.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the output is multiple greens.
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"", the output is multiple blues.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", the output is multiple reds.

The repetitions of the color correspond to the word preceding ""walm"". Since ""lug"" is associated with blue, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"", suggesting that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word before it and repeats that color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,67
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position or the surrounding words.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" To confirm this, we should inspect every instance of the word ""dax"" and the corresponding output:

1. dax lug bluf -> green blue blue
2. wif bluf dax lug -> red red green blue
3. dax bluf -> green green
4. zup dax lug zup -> yellow green blue yellow
5. wif lug dax -> red blue green

In each case, the word ""dax"" is directly translated to ""green"" in the output sequence. There is no instance where ""dax"" corresponds to a different color or any variation based on context.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, we can infer the following relationships:

- Whenever the input is solely ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is combined with ""lug,"" the output includes ""red"" followed by ""blue.""
- When ""wif"" is presented with ""lug zup,"" the order generates ""red"" at the end after ""blue"" and ""yellow.""
- When ""wif"" is with ""dax bluf,"" the output is ""red"" followed by ""green"" twice.

The consistent pattern is that every instance of ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red."" Therefore, irrespective of the context or position in a sequence, ""wif"" translates to ""red."" 

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Explanation: In every example, whenever the word 'zup' appears, it is translated to 'yellow' regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, 'zup' consistently means 'yellow'.
Observing the pattern of inputs and outputs, we can infer the rule for the nonce word ""bluf."" In each example, the output for ""bluf"" is the same color as the word immediately preceding it:

- In the first example, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and both are followed by ""yellow"" in the output.
- In the second example, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and both are followed by ""green"" in the output.
- In the third example, ""zup"" is the only word before ""bluf"" and both translate to ""yellow"" in the output.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and both are followed by ""red"" in the output.
- In the fifth example, there is a similarity to the second example where ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and both yield ""green"" as the output.

Based on this pattern, the rule seems to be that the meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the outputs corresponding to the presence of ""walm"" in the inputs. Here are the observations:

1. When ""lug walm"" is the input, the output is ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting that ""lug"" might represent ""blue"" and ""walm"" could imply repeating that color thrice.

2. In ""wif walm zup walm,"" we see ""red red red yellow yellow yellow"" in the output. ""wif"" seems to represent ""red"" and ""zup"" represents ""yellow,"" with ""walm"" apparently causing both colors to be repeated thrice.

3. In ""wif dax zup walm,"" which outputs ""red green yellow yellow yellow,"" ""wif"" seems to stand for ""red,"" ""dax"" for ""green,"" and ""zup"" for ""yellow."" Here, ""walm"" seems to cause the preceding color (""yellow"") to repeat two more times, for a total of three times.

4. ""wif lug walm"" corresponds to ""red blue blue blue,"" further reinforcing the idea that ""walm"" repeats the color before it three times in total.

5. Lastly, ""wif walm dax zup"" results in ""red red red green yellow,"" where ""walm"" again seems to triple the color before it (""red""), but does not affect ""green,"" which comes after a non-""walm"" element (""dax"").

Based on these observations, we can rule out ""walm"" causing repetition of a specific color or being independent of context, as it consistently repeats the color mentioned before it. Also, the repetition only occurs with the previous color mentioned, not with any subsequent ones.

Rule: walm -> repeats the previous color mentioned three times in total.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,68
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following correlations:

- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue 

The examples demonstrate a consistent output color for each input word except for the word ""lug,"" which consistently outputs ""blue"" in each instance it is used. Other words consistently correlate with their respective colors regardless of position or repetition in the input sequence.

Rule: lug -> blue
Using the examples provided, it seems that each nonce word corresponds to a color. The word 'dax' consistently translates to 'green' in English. Here is the observed correspondence:

dax -> green
lug -> blue
wif -> red
zup -> yellow
bluf -> red (based on the only example given, which might suggest a typo or repetition rule that we don't have enough data to confirm; 'bluf' may still be an unaccounted-for color, or simply an alternate or incorrect spelling leading to 'red')

Rule:
- 'dax' in every context translates to the color 'green'.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that each nonce word (zup, bluf, wif, walm, dax, lug) corresponds to a color in the output. To figure out what color ""wif"" corresponds to, let's examine the instances where ""wif"" appears and its matching color in the output:

1. Input: ""zup bluf wif walm"" | Output: ""yellow yellow red red red""
   - ""wif"" appears after ""bluf"" and corresponds to the first ""red"" in the output.

2. Input: ""wif zup walm dax zup"" | Output: ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow""
   - ""wif"" appears at the beginning and corresponds to the first ""red"" in the output.

3. Input: ""zup wif dax walm lug"" | Output: ""yellow red green green green blue""
   - ""wif"" appears after ""zup"" and corresponds to the ""red"" in the output.

4. Input: ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" | Output: ""blue red red green blue blue""
   - ""wif"" appears after ""lug"" and before ""bluf,"" and corresponds to the first ""red"" in the output.

5. Input: ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" | Output: ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green""
   - ""wif"" appears after the second ""zup"" and corresponds to the ""red"" in the output.

In all instances, ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Other words in the examples correspond to their respective colors every time they appear as well. As consistency is observed across all examples, we can confidently deduce the meaning of ""wif.""

Rule: wif -> red.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Each occurrence of the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the outputs provided.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word 'bluf', let's look at the correspondence between the inputs and outputs:

- When 'dax' is present, the output has 'green'.
- When 'zup' is present, the output has 'yellow'.
- When 'lug' is present, the output has 'blue'.
- When 'wif' is present, the output has 'red'.

Now, we examine the occurrences of 'bluf' and the corresponding output:

- In ""dax zup bluf"", the output is ""green yellow yellow"". Here, 'bluf' seems to correspond to an additional 'yellow', considering that 'zup' also translates to 'yellow'.
- In ""dax zup lug bluf"", the output is ""green yellow blue blue"". Again, 'bluf' adds an additional 'blue' after 'lug', which itself corresponds to 'blue'.
- In ""wif bluf"", the output is ""red red"". 'bluf' corresponds to an additional 'red', matching the output for 'wif'.
- In ""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax"", the output sequence matches the input, with 'bluf' taking on the color of the word preceding it (blue after 'lug', yellow after 'zup').
- In ""zup bluf"", the output is ""yellow yellow"". This further supports our observation that 'bluf' repeats the color of the word before it.

Thus, the rule for the nonce word 'bluf' seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. 'Bluf' repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" correlates with repeating the color associated with the word that precedes it three times. Here's the association of words with colors based on the given examples:

- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue

Now let's apply this rule to the examples:

Example 1: ""zup wif dax walm"" translates to ""yellow red green green green."" In this case, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the color green is repeated three times.
 
Example 2: ""zup wif lug zup walm"" translates to ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the color yellow is repeated three times.

Example 3: ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green."" ""Walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the color green is repeated three times.

Example 4: ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""Walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the color yellow is repeated three times.

Example 5: ""lug walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue."" ""Walm"" first follows ""lug,"" repeating blue three times, and the second ""walm"" also follows ""lug,"" repeating blue three more times.

Here is the rule based on the examples:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup wif
    ",Output: yellow red,yellow red,True,69
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"" in every given example.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, irrespective of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. It seems that the word ""dax"" translates directly to ""green"" and does not depend on context.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""wif"" directly corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
From the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds directly to the color ""yellow."" This determination is made by identifying the consistent presence of ""yellow"" in the output each time ""zup"" is featured in the input. To further validate this, we can cross reference other non-""zup"" examples. We see:

- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" in the output.
- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"" in the output.
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
- ""bluf"" has only appeared once, but it precedes ""lug"" which is ""blue,"" and as ""bluf lug"" corresponds to ""yellow blue"" in the output, and because ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""bluf"" must correlate to ""yellow.""

Despite ""bluf"" appearing to correlate to ""yellow,"" we have only one instance of ""bluf,"" which happens to yield the same color as ""zup."" The rule induction is based on the evidence that ""zup"" consistently results in ""yellow"" whereas ""bluf"" may coincide but is not confirmed as a standalone instance.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

zup -> yellow
Based on the examples given, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be that it translates to a color repeated as many times as the preceding color word in the input sequence. Here is the breakdown:

- In the first input, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and afterwards ""bluf"" repeats the color blue twice (since ""dax"" corresponds to green once).
- In the second input, we have a sequence of colors: ""red,"" ""yellow,"" then ""blue"" from ""lug,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color blue three times (as ""walm"" was not given an output, its corresponding color is not known).
- In the third input, ""dax"" is green and ""zup"" is yellow, with ""wif"" being red, ""bluf"" then repeats the color red twice.
- The fourth example contains ""lug"" which is blue, and ""dax"" which is green; ""bluf"" follows each and repeats the corresponding colors, resulting in two blues then two greens.
- Finally, in the fifth input, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""bluf"" repeats that color twice.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Repeat the color of the most recent color word the number of times that the color word precedes it in the input sequence. If the color word appears once before ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" corresponds to that color word once. If it appears twice, then ""bluf"" corresponds to that color word twice, and so on.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that walm is a nonce word whose meaning changes depending on the preceding word. The pattern suggests that walm means a repetition of the color that is associated with the word right before it. Here are the mappings we can identify:

- lug is associated with blue.
- wif is associated with red.
- zup is associated with yellow.
- dax, and bluf are not followed by walm in the examples given, so their interaction with walm is not demonstrated; however, we know from the first example that dax maps to green and bluf to red.

From the inputs and outputs, the rules appear to be:

- If lug comes before walm, the output is blue repeated three times.
- If wif comes before walm, the output is red repeated three times.
- If zup comes before walm, the output is yellow repeated three times.

Therefore, the general rule for walm seems to be that it takes the color of the word immediately before it and repeats that color in the output three times.

Rule: walm -> repeating the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,70
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the word 'lug' seems to consistently translate to 'blue'. Each time 'lug' is present in the input, the output contains the word 'blue'. Other words also appear to have fixed color translations that correlate with the outputs: 'wif' translates to 'red', 'zup' to 'yellow', 'bluf' to 'red', and 'dax' to 'green'. 

Rule: lug -> blue
Analyzing the given examples, we can try to deduce a rule or pattern for the meaning of ""dax.""

1. dax walm zup lug dax -> green green green yellow blue green
2. lug dax lug -> blue green blue
3. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
4. dax walm -> green green green
5. dax lug wif -> green blue red

If we pay close attention, ""dax"" seems to be associated with the color ""green"" each time it appears, regardless of its position in the sequence. It consistently leads or follows other words yet retains the green designation. Other words, like ""lug"" and ""walm,"" correspond to blue, while ""wif"" is associated with red. The word ""zup"" is seen once and is associated with yellow. The sequence ""walm"" after ""dax"" repeats the color associated with ""dax,"" which in this case is green, for the same number of letters contained in ""walm.”

Rule: 
Dax -> Green, with the additional rule that if ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" the color ""green"" is repeated for the same number of letters in the word ""walm"" (i.e., four letters in ""walm"" lead to four greens).
To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's compare the input and output of each example provided:

1. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red
2. wif dax zup walm -> red green yellow yellow yellow
3. lug zup wif zup -> blue yellow red yellow
4. lug wif -> blue red
5. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red

Now, let's analyze:

- In examples 1 and 3, ""zup"" appears before and after ""wif"" and translates to ""yellow"" before ""wif"" and ""yellow"" after ""wif"". But when ""wif"" follows ""zup,"" we always have ""red"" in the output.
- In example 2, ""wif"" precedes ""dax"" and the output starts with ""red"". In example 1, ""wif"" follows ""dax"" and results in ""red"" in the output as well.
- In every instance, the word immediately following ""wif"" results in a ""red"" in the output.
- ""wif"" does not always correspond directly to ""red"", since ""wif"" must be followed by another word (as seen in example 4, ""lug wif"" does not translate to ""blue red red"").

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" causes the following word to translate to ""red"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> causes the following word to be output as ""red"".
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each word corresponds to a specific color when translated from the input to the output.

From the examples:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Thus, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" appears to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples given, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that is mentioned right before it.

- In example one, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" follows it, resulting in ""red red"".
- In example two, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, followed by ""bluf"", resulting in ""blue blue"".
- In example three, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, followed by ""bluf"", resulting in ""yellow yellow"".
- In example four, ""wif"" corresponds to red, followed by ""bluf"", resulting in ""red red"".
- In example five, ""wif"" corresponds to red, but it's followed by ""lug"" (blue), then ""bluf"", resulting in ""red red blue"".

This suggests that the rule for ""bluf"" is to repeat the color of the previous word in the sequence, unless a new color word is introduced before ""bluf"", in which case ""bluf"" takes the color of the latest color word.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the word right before it.
Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of ""walm"" by examining the context in which it appears and the corresponding output colors.

1. ""dax walm zup"" corresponds to ""green green green yellow"", and ""zup"" alone corresponds to ""yellow"", so ""dax"" likely means ""green"" and ""walm"" might be contributing to ""green"" as well, followed by ""zup"" being ""yellow"".

2. ""lug walm zup lug walm"" generates ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue"". Here, ""lug"" seems to mean ""blue"", ""zup"" still means ""yellow"", and ""walm"" again seems to contribute to the color ""green"" by preceding it with ""blue"".

3. ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"", and since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", in this instance, ""walm"" alone does not have an apparent effect on the output color.

4. ""dax walm wif bluf"" results in ""green green green red red"". Here ""dax"" is ""green"" and the appearance of ""walm"" continues the sequence of ""green"". Both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" result in ""red"", suggesting that they are unrelated to the word ""walm"".

5. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" becomes ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"". In this example, ""walm"", following ""zup"", seems to extend the sequence of the color ""yellow"".

From these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it carries the sequence of the color immediately before it. If it follows ""dax"" which means ""green"", the sequence of ""green"" continues. If it follows ""zup"" which is ""yellow"", the sequence of ""yellow"" continues. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" which is ""blue"", it instead results in the color ""green"", suggesting that the presence of ""walm"" after ""lug"" changes the output color specifically to green.

Rule: walm -> extends the color sequence of the preceding word, unless following ""lug"", in which case it changes the sequence to green.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,71
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can observe a pattern that associates the nonce word ""lug"" with a particular color based on its position relative to other nonce words that correlate with known colors. Let's break down the examples to identify the rule:

1. lug wif bluf dax lug bluf → blue red red green blue blue
2. lug walm wif → blue blue blue red
3. dax lug → green blue
4. zup walm dax lug → yellow yellow yellow green blue
5. wif lug zup → red blue yellow

To identify the rule for ""lug,"" let's examine instances where ""lug"" immediately follows a color term:

- In example 1, ""lug"" comes after ""bluf"" and before ""dax"" yet both times it translates to ""blue.""
- In example 3, ""lug"" comes after ""dax"" (which translates to ""green"") and ""lug"" is ""blue.""
- In example 5, ""lug"" comes after ""wif"" (which translates to ""red"") yet ""lug"" is still ""blue.""

In every case, regardless of the preceding or following words, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue."" From these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""lug"" is consistent and does not depend on the context within the given dataset.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following mappings for words to colors:

- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- walm -> yellow (not entirely certain, but all examples suggest this)
- lug -> blue (only one instance, so assumed from last example)

Looking at these mappings and the outputs, we can determine the meaning of dax by looking at the color that follows each instance of dax:

- zup dax -> yellow green
- dax zup -> green yellow
- zup walm dax lug -> yellow yellow yellow green blue
- dax wif -> green red
- wif zup walm dax zup -> red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

From these examples, every time dax is used, the color green follows in the output. There are no instances where dax is followed by a different color.

Thus, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" is as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""zup"" correlates to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Additionally, the provided inputs and outputs maintain a one-to-one relationship between each word and color except for the first example, which indicates that consecutive same words in the input are translated to consecutive same colors in the output.

To articulate this more formally:

- ""dax"" → ""green""
- ""wif"" → ""red""
- ""lug"" → ""blue""
- ""bluf"" and ""zup"" appear only once in a sentence that has corresponding colors; since ""bluf"" is directly followed by ""red"" in the output without another word in between, it indicates that ""bluf"" might translate to ""blue,"" which leaves ""zup"" to mean ""yellow"".

Thus, the rule seems to be:
zup -> yellow

This is a direct translation from the nonce word to the color without any indication of dependency on context or other words.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" when it is preceded by the word ""dax"" but translates to ""blue"" in all other contexts. Here is how the rules apply to each example:

1. Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
   Output: blue green green yellow blue red
   - ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"".

2. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue
   - ""bluf"" on its own after ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".

3. Input: zup lug bluf
   Output: yellow blue blue
   - ""bluf"" on its own after ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".

4. Input: zup bluf wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow red red
   - The ""bluf"" after ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".
   - The ""bluf"" on its own translates to ""red"".
   - This example stands out as it contradicts the emerging rule, however, if we assume a mistake in the pattern, rest of the examples suggest ""bluf"" should mean ""blue"" as in other instances.

5. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
   Output: blue red green green red blue
   - ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"".

It seems there may be inconsistent information in the examples, specifically with the fourth example. If we exclude the fourth example as erroneous, we can conclude:

Rule: 
- ""bluf"" after ""dax"" means ""green"".
- ""bluf"" in all other contexts means ""blue"".

This analysis does not take into account the possibility of errors or exceptions in the examples, and that the fourth example stands out as potentially incorrectly given. If the fourth example is accurate, there would need to be an additional rule or exception to explain the inconsistency. However, with the information provided, we can only state the most straightforward rule as mentioned above. 

Bluf -> Green when preceded by dax; Blue in all other contexts.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns present in the examples provided:

- When ""dax walm wif zup"" is the input, the output is ""green green green red yellow""
  This implies that ""walm"" might be related to the repetition of the color associated with ""dax,"" which is green, before changing the pattern for ""wif"" and ""zup.""
  
- In ""lug walm zup,"" the output is ""blue blue blue yellow""
  Again, ""walm"" seems to induce a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word (""lug"" -> blue) prior to switching for ""zup.""

- ""dax wif walm"" results in ""green red red red""
  Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" instead of being next to ""dax,"" but the output is still predominantly red after ""wif.""

- ""lug wif walm"" results in ""blue red red red""
  As with the previous example, but with ""lug"" as the starting word, ""walm"" causes the output to be predominantly red following ""wif.""

- ""zup wif walm"" gives ""yellow red red red""
  Here, we see the pattern is consistent with previous examples when ""walm"" is in the position following ""wif""; the output is primarily red.

Based on these observations, it seems that the word ""walm"" functions to repeat the color of the word that appears just before ""walm."" However, when ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the pattern alters to produce red repeatedly. 

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word unless the preceding word is ""wif,"" in which case the color is red repeatedly.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup dax
    ",Output: blue yellow green,blue yellow green,True,72
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in every given output.
Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following color associations for each word, except ""dax"":

- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> red 

All the outputs consistently have ""green"" as the last color, following the occurrence of the word ""dax"" in the input. Given that the word ""dax"" does not correspond to any other word preceding it and considering its placement before the color ""green"", we can deduce that ""dax"" is itself associated with the color green. 

Therefore, we can write the rule as:

dax -> green
Using the provided examples, we can analyze the occurrences of the nonce word ""wif"" and the corresponding color outputs to determine the meaning of ""wif.""

Here's the breakdown of each example:

1. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
   Output: red green red red yellow red

2. Input: zup dax wif
   Output: yellow green red

3. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red

4. Input: wif zup wif dax
   Output: red yellow red green

5. Input: lug zup dax wif zup
   Output: blue yellow green red yellow

In every input where ""wif"" appears, the corresponding output is ""red."" For instance:

- In the first example, ""wif"" appears four times and each time the corresponding output is ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" appears once at the end of the input, and the output is ""red.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" appears once and results in ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" appears twice, both times resulting in ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" appears once, again resulting in ""red.""

So based on this consistent pattern across all examples, the rule can be outlined as follows:

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Therefore:

wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is used in the input, ""yellow"" is used in the corresponding output. The other words in the examples correspond to their respective colors consistently: ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and so on.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can look at the patterns in the input and their corresponding outputs. It is helpful to identify the rule that leads from the ""Input"" to the ""Output"". Here's the pattern that emerges from the examples provided:

- In example 1, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""walm"" to ""red"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"". The word ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and results in an additional ""blue"".
- In example 2, the pattern is similar: ""wif"" is ""red"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", and ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" with another ""blue"".
- In example 3, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"". Again, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and results in ""yellow"". Notably, ""zup"" precedes and follows ""bluf"" here, with both instances of ""zup"" giving ""yellow"".
- In example 4, ""lug"" appears multiple times and is always ""blue"". Following ""lug"", ""bluf"" adds another instance of ""blue"".
- In example 5, ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""dax"" is ""green"", and ""lug"" is ""blue"". ""Bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" which results in ""green"".

From the examples given, ""bluf"" seems to act as a modifier or repeater for the color associated with ""lug"", which is ""blue"". However, we have an inconsistency in example 3 where ""bluf"" is followed by a repetition of the next word's color (""yellow""). Since this is a single instance that doesn't fit the pattern of the other examples, we might tentatively consider it an exception or an error. We will formulate the rule based on the majority pattern observed.

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the blue color output associated with the word ""lug"" that immediately precedes it.

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning: repeats the color ""blue"" associated with the word ""lug"".
Observing the provided examples:

- Example 1 lists ""wif walm"" resulting in ""red red red."" Since ""wif"" appears once and ""red"" appears three times, it is unclear how ""walm"" contributes to the output.
- Example 2 lists ""zup walm wif"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow red."" Since ""zup"" precedes ""walm wif,"" it corresponds to a sequence of three ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" at the end correlates with ""red.""
- Example 3 lists ""lug dax walm wif"" yielding ""blue green green green red."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" leads to two additional ""green"" after ""blue,"" and once again, ""wif"" appears at the end with ""red.""
- Example 4 only shows ""zup walm"" and results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which indicates that ""walm"" might not contribute to the output as ""zup"" has already determined the color sequence.
- Example 5 lists ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" resulting in ""blue blue red blue red red red blue."" In this case, ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" but the sequence of three ""red"" seems to also be influenced by the preceding appearance of ""walm.""

Considering the repetition and positions of the respective colors and the nonce word ""walm,"" one possible rule is that ""walm"" does not correspond to a color by itself, but rather repeats the last color mentioned before it. To confirm this, let's break down example 5 in particular, since it includes multiple instances and should help isolate the behavior of ""walm"":

- ""lug bluf wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue red"" (using prior deductions: ""lug"" -> ""blue"" and ""wif"" -> ""red"").
- After ""walm,"" the color ""red"" repeats three times despite only one appearance of ""wif.""
- Another ""lug"" after the sequence provides a ""blue"" at the end.

Based on the evidence and the potential rule, we get:

Rule: ""walm"" -> repeats the last mentioned color.

Therefore, wherever ""walm"" appears, it causes the immediately preceding color to repeat in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif dax walm
    ",Output: blue red green green green,blue red green green green,True,73
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all the given examples. Each instance of ""lug"" in the input corresponds directly to ""blue"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we must look at the correspondences between the inputs and outputs in each example.

- In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

- In the second example, ""zup"" still corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" is again associated with ""green.""

- The third example is a shortened version of the second, reinforcing the correspondences of ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

- The fourth example introduces a new word ""bluf,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" since ""zup"" also corresponds to ""yellow."" This suggests that ""bluf"" might be synonymous with ""zup"" or have a different rule that wasn't discerned from other examples, but in this case it outputs the same color. ""Wif"" and ""lug"" maintain their correspondences to ""red"" and ""blue,"" respectively, and ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green.""

- The fifth example reconfirms the correspondences of ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and again ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce that:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" 

Therefore,

dax -> green.
wif -> meaning. Meaning is the color red in the context provided.

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color red regardless of its position in a sequence of words. It appears to function independently, not influenced by adjacent words. Other words, such as ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup"" correspond to other colors (""lug"" to blue, ""dax"" to green, ""zup"" to yellow), but ""wif"" consistently maps to red.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""zup,"" let's first list the examples given:

1. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
2. zup dax zup -> yellow green yellow
3. lug dax zup wif -> blue green yellow red
4. lug zup lug -> blue yellow blue
5. zup bluf -> yellow yellow

Analyzing these examples, we can see that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow."" This can be confirmed as each instance of ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input or the other words that it is combined with.

Therefore, we can define the rule as:

zup -> ""yellow""

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided, one can deduce that the nonce word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" However, in some output sequences, the word ""bluf"" is translated to ""blue,"" specifically when it appears after the word ""lug.""

Here are the rules based on the position of ""bluf"" in the sequence relative to ""lug"":

1. When ""bluf"" appears before ""lug,"" it translates to ""red.""
2. When ""bluf"" appears after ""lug,"" it translates to ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule can be summarized as follows:

Rule: If the word ""bluf"" appears before ""lug"" in the sequence, it means ""red"". If it appears after ""lug"", it means ""blue"".
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" leads to repeating the color output associated with the word that immediately precedes it twice. Here is the breakdown of the examples:

1. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
    - ""zup"" corresponds to a single yellow, followed by ""walm"" which yields two more yellows.

2. wif dax zup walm -> red green yellow yellow yellow
    - ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""dax"" to green, and ""zup"" to a single yellow, followed by ""walm"" which again yields two more yellows.

3. wif walm zup lug wif walm zup -> red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
    - ""wif"" is red, followed by ""walm"" which replicates red twice. Then ""zup"" is a single yellow, ""lug"" is blue, ""wif"" is red, followed by ""walm"" which replicates red twice again, then ""zup"" gives another yellow.

4. wif walm dax -> red red red green
    - ""wif"" corresponds to red followed by ""walm"", which again yields two more reds, and ""dax"" is green.

5. lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow
    - ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" to red, ""dax"" to green, followed by ""walm"" which yields two more greens, and then ""zup"" results in a single yellow.

Based on these observations, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately before it two additional times.

Rule: walm -> means to repeat the color associated with the preceding word two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax lug walm
    ",Output: yellow green blue blue blue,yellow green blue blue blue,True,74
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each provided example.
The examples provided suggest that ""dax"" serves as a color indicator, specifically indicating the color green. When ""dax"" is combined with other nonce words, it seems to modify the output by either adding the color green or transforming the sequence of colors to include green.

For instance:
- In ""dax lug,"" the word ""lug"" must mean blue, since the output is ""green blue"" once ""dax"" is added.
- In ""dax walm,"" ""walm"" does not correlate to other colors in previous examples, but ""dax walm"" outputs three greens, which may mean ""walm"" repeats the color green three times.

Based on the above, we can form the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" To confirm this, let's examine the patterns in the input and their corresponding outputs:

Example 1: ""zup wif zup dax"" -> ""yellow red yellow green""
- Here, ""wif"" is surrounded by two ""zups,"" and in the output, it is between two ""yellows.""

Example 2: ""zup wif lug dax"" -> ""yellow red blue green""
- ""wif"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""lug,"" corresponding to ""red"" following ""yellow"" and preceding ""blue.""

Example 3: ""dax lug wif"" -> ""green blue red""
- ""wif"" is at the end, following ""lug"" and ""dax,"" and similarly, in the output, ""red"" is at the end following ""blue"" and ""green.""

Example 4: ""lug wif bluf lug wif"" -> ""blue red red blue red""
- Both occurrences of ""wif"" correspond to ""red"" in the output, regardless of their position.

Example 5: ""lug zup dax wif zup"" -> ""blue yellow green red yellow""
- Again ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the output, positioned after ""green"" and before ""yellow.""

Rule:
wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Every instance of ""zup"" in the examples corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color mentioned at the end of each output sequence. When ""bluf"" is paired with a unique word like ""dax,"" ""zup,"" or ""wif,"" the output color is repeated twice. Here are the examples demonstrating this pattern:

1. Input: dax zup lug bluf
   Output: green yellow blue blue
   Analysis: ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""zup"" to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, and ""bluf"" also to blue, thus repeating the color blue at the end of the sequence.

2. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   Analysis: ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""bluf"" repeats the color mentioned before it, which is yellow.

3. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   Analysis: ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""bluf"" repeats red, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" is not paired directly with a color but seems to cause a repetition of the color green.

4. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   Analysis: This is the same as example 2, further supporting the rule.

5. Input: wif bluf lug
   Output: red red blue
   Analysis: ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""bluf"" repeats red, and ""lug"" corresponds to blue.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" causes the color corresponding to the word just before it to be repeated.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word that comes before ""bluf.""
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" represents the color associated with the preceding word. Here's how it breaks down:

1. ""dax"" seems to be associated with ""green,"" so when ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green.""
2. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red"" (as seen in the second example).
3. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue"" (as seen in the third and fourth examples).

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is that it duplicates the color associated with the previous word three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, the consistent rule seems to be that the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".

Rule: lug translates to ""blue"".
Rule: dax -> green

The word 'dax' consistently translates to 'green' in all given examples, regardless of the context or position in the sentence.
Rule: wif -> red. The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the outputs.
To deduce the meaning or rule of the nonce word 'zup', let's look at the consistencies whenever 'zup' is present in the input:

- zup dax walm zup wif -> yellow green green green yellow red
- zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
- lug wif dax zup walm -> blue red green yellow yellow yellow
- zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
- zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue

Analyzing the occurrences:

1. Whenever 'zup' appears in the input, 'yellow' always appears at the corresponding position in the output.
2. No other word in the input consistently maps to 'yellow' in the output.
3. 'zup' does not seem to affect the color represented by the following words.

Therefore, the rule for 'zup' seems to be consistent based on the examples given:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns in the given examples.

1. When ""dax bluf"" is the input, the output is ""green green."" The repeated output suggests that ""bluf"" could mean ""green"".

2. However, in the second example, ""zup lug bluf"" leads to ""yellow blue blue."" Here, ""bluf"" results in ""blue,"" which conflicts with the first deduction.

3. The third input ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" gives ""green red yellow yellow red red red."" Focusing on the position of ""bluf"" between ""zup"" and ""wif,"" we note that ""bluf"" this time corresponds to ""yellow.""

4. The fourth input ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" outputs ""yellow green yellow green red red."" Here, ""bluf"" is at the end following ""wif"" and corresponds to ""red.""

5. Lastly, ""lug bluf zup"" results in ""blue blue yellow."" Therefore ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" before ""zup.""

Looking at these examples, ""bluf"" translates to a color, but it is not consistent across examples. The key seems to be the word that directly precedes ""bluf"":

- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green.""(Example 1)
- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue."" (Examples 2 and 5)
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red."" (Examples 3 and 4)
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow."" (Example 3)

Therefore, it appears that ""bluf"" stands for a color, and its specific color is determined by the word that comes right before it. 

Rule: bluf -> color, where the specific color is dictated by the preceding word:

- ""dax"" before ""bluf"" -> green
- ""lug"" before ""bluf"" -> blue
- ""wif"" before ""bluf"" -> red
- ""zup"" before ""bluf"" -> yellow
Based on the given examples, let's analyze the corresponding outputs for the pattern of ""walm"":

1. In the first example, ""walm lug"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow"" and each subsequent ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" So, ""walm"" here leads to a change from ""blue"" to ""yellow.""

2. In the second example, ""walm"" precedes a sequence of ""red red red"" which does not immediately correlate with the first example, but we can see that ""dax zup"" correlates with ""green yellow.""

3. In the third example, ""wif walm lug"" corresponds to ""red red red blue."" This indicates that ""walm"" leads to a continuation of the preceding color ""red"" but does not carry into the color for ""lug,"" which is blue.

4. In the fourth and fifth example, ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""zalm"" appears to perpetuate the color ""yellow.""

From these examples, it seems that the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the next color (or possibly sequence of colors) to repeat the color value preceding it. So, if the color before ""walm"" is ""yellow,"" there will be a sequence of ""yellow"" following it. Likewise with ""red,"" as seen in example three.

Rule: walm -> causes the next color to repeat the color value preceding ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Every time ""lug"" appears in the input, the output is ""blue.""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green."" The other words seem to correspond to their own color as well. ""Lug"" always results in ""blue"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green."" The word ""walm,"" when it appears, results in ""blue blue blue,"" which could be a repetition rule indicating that ""walm"" translates into three instances of the color ""blue.""

Here is the rule induction based on the input and output pairs:

dax -> green
lug -> blue
bluf -> green
walm -> blue blue blue

Rule:
- The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green.""
- Other words translate to a specific color.
- The word ""walm"" uniquely results in a repeated color output, specifically three times ""blue.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" consistently translates to the output ""red"". There are no examples provided where ""wif"" translates to anything other than ""red"", and it appears independently as well as in combination with other words.

The input ""wif dax bluf"" leading to the output ""red green green"" may initially seem to introduce complexity, but since ""wif"" is consistent with producing ""red"" and ""bluf"" consistently produces ""green"" (as seen in ""zup wif bluf"" and ""wif dax bluf""), it is plausible to infer that ""dax"" also translates to ""green"".

The context of the other words (""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"") appears to support this pattern.

Rule: wif -> red.
According to the provided examples, the rule seems to be:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the position in the input sequence.
bluf -> repeats the previous color mentioned

Rule: Whenever 'bluf' occurs, it is replaced by the color mentioned just before it in the sequence.
Rule: The word ""walm"" means repeating the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it three times.

More specifically:
- ""lug wif walm"" corresponds to ""blue red red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to red, which is repeated three times after ""walm.""
- ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"" because the last color before ""walm"" is yellow, so yellow is repeated three times.
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" corresponds to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to blue, which is repeated three times after ""walm.""
- ""dax walm wif"" corresponds to ""green green green red"" because ""dax"" corresponds to green, which is repeated three times before ""wif.""
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to red, which is repeated three times after ""walm.""

Conclusion: walm -> repeating the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the given examples. Every time ""lug"" appears in an input, the output is ""blue"".
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""dax"" seems to have a consistent correspondence with the output ""green."" There is also a pattern where other words correspond to specific colors, such as ""wif"" to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"". Moreover, ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow"". It appears that each word translates to a specific color in the output.

The rules that can be deduced are as follows:

- ""dax"" -> ""green""
- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" is not directly translated in the examples but appears to be in the sequence associated with ""red,"" identical to the output for ""wif."" However, without a direct input-to-output example for ""bluf,"" we cannot confirm this association.

Rule: Each word is translated into a specific color. ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" appears in an input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding output.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow."" In each example, regardless of the surrounding words, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" can be stated as follows:

Rule:
zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to translate to a specific color depending on the word that immediately precedes it. Let's examine the pattern:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow."" So when ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it means ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red."" So when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it means ""red.""
- In the third example, we see ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" meaning when ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" it means ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, we again see that ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" and ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red."" This is consistent with the above rules.
- In the fifth example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" which is again consistent with the first rule.

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" is that it takes the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the subsequent color to be repeated three times. 

In the first example, ""wif"" leads to a single red output, but when ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is three reds instead of one. Similarly, in the second example, ""zup"" leads to a yellow output, and when ""walm"" follows, there are three consecutive greens instead of one.

To formalize the rule:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the next word three times.

If we breakdown each example:

1. ""zup bluf wif walm""
   - ""zup"" leads to ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" leads to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" leads to ""red"" and ""walm"" follows, so ""red red red""

2. ""wif zup walm dax zup""
   - ""wif"" leads to ""red""
   - ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"" and ""walm"" follows, so ""yellow yellow yellow""
   - ""dax"" leads to ""green""
   - ""zup"" leads to ""yellow""

3. ""dax walm zup lug walm""
   - ""dax"" leads to ""green"" and ""walm"" follows, so ""green green green""
   - ""zup"" leads to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" leads to ""blue"" and ""walm"" follows, so ""blue blue blue""

4. ""zup dax walm zup wif""
   - ""zup"" leads to ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" leads to ""green"" and ""walm"" follows, so ""green green green""
   - ""zup"" leads to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" leads to ""red""

5. ""wif walm""
   - ""wif"" leads to ""red"" and ""walm"" follows, so ""red red red""

So the rule induction for ""walm"" seems to be the replication of the color output of the subsequent word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax wif
    ",Output: blue green red,blue green red,True,78
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, independent of its position within the input string or the other words present.

Rule: lug translates to the color blue.
To determine the meaning of ""dax"" from these examples, let's look for a pattern in the given inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. When ""dax"" is followed by ""zup,"" the pattern is ""green yellow green.""
   - Input: dax zup dax walm
   - Output: green yellow green green green

2. A single ""dax"" translates to a single ""green.""
   - Input: dax
   - Output: green

3. ""Dax"" followed by ""bluf"" leads to the pattern ""green green.""
   - Input: dax bluf
   - Output: green green

4. ""Dax"" occurs after ""bluf"" and still translates to ""green.""
   - Input: lug bluf dax bluf
   - Output: blue blue green green

5. ""Dax"" proceeds other words and maintains the output of ""green.""
   - Input: dax zup lug wif lug
   - Output: green yellow blue red blue

From the above examples, we can deduce that the output ""green"" is consistently produced by the presence of the word ""dax,"" regardless of its position or the other words surrounding it. Furthermore, ""dax"" does not seem dependent on specific other words because it retains its meaning even when other words in the sequence change.

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in the output, and this meaning is context-independent within the given examples.

Therefore, the rule is:
dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the provided examples.
Analyzing the examples provided:

- In the first example, ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow."" This implies ""lug"" could mean ""blue"" and ""zup"" could mean ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""zup lug zup dax"" becomes ""yellow blue yellow green."" Since we inferred ""lug"" could mean ""blue,"" it seems plausible that ""zup"" indeed means ""yellow."" ""Dax"" might then mean ""green.""
- In the third example, ""zup dax"" turns into ""yellow green."" This further supports that ""zup"" means ""yellow"" and ""dax"" means ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup wif lug wif"" translates to ""yellow red blue red."" We have already deduced that ""lug"" means ""blue,"" and seeing the ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" both times it appears, this supports the single translations for each nonce word without modification by adjacent words.
- The fifth example, ""lug zup bluf dax,"" converts to ""blue yellow yellow green."" This implies ""bluf"" also translates to ""yellow,"" and it's not influenced by its position, as ""zup"" does, reinforcing that ""zup"" specifically means ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to repeating the color mentioned before it. If there is no color mentioned before ""bluf,"" it repeats the color associated with the word right before it. Here are the specific cases:

1. ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"", which means ""bluf"" is repeating the color associated with ""wif"".
2. ""wif lug zup bluf"" translates to ""red blue yellow yellow"", which means ""bluf"" is repeating the color associated with ""zup"".
3. ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue"", which again shows ""bluf"" repeating the color associated with the word before it (""zup"" in this case).
4. ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"", which shows ""bluf"" repeating ""yellow"" which is the color for ""zup"".
5. ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow green yellow green red red"", which indicates ""bluf"" is repeating the color for ""wif"".

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.
By examining the outputs of each input sequence where the word ""walm"" appears, it seems that when the word ""walm"" is used, it translates into a sequence of ""green"" colors in the output that are as many as the number of words that come before ""walm"" in the input sequence.

Here are the observations from the examples:

1. ""dax walm wif"" results in ""green green green red,"" implying that ""walm"" caused the two words before it (""dax"" and itself ""walm"") to output ""green green,"" and then ""wif"" turned to red.

2. ""wif walm dax zup"" results in ""red red red green yellow,"" implying that ""walm"" caused the two words before it (""wif"" and itself ""walm"") to output ""red red,"" followed by the ""dax"" corresponding to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

3. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"", which confirms that ""walm"" caused the word before it (""dax"") and itself to result in multiple ""green"" outputs.

4. ""zup wif dax walm"" results in ""yellow red green green green,"" which also shows the same pattern where the three words before ""walm"" and ""walm"" itself result in four greens in the output.

5. ""zup walm lug wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue red,"" where the two yellows in the beginning correspond to ""zup"" and ""walm,"" followed by the colors corresponding to ""lug"" and ""wif.""

Given this pattern, ""walm"" seems to cause all words before it, including itself, to produce the color green in the output, irrespective of what those words normally translate to in terms of colors. 

So the rule is:

walm -> Each word before ""walm"", including ""walm"" itself, translates to ""green"" in the output. The number of ""green"" outputs corresponds to the number of words before ""walm"" plus one for ""walm"".

Rule: For each occurrence of ""walm,"" output ""green"" for each word preceding ""walm"" in the input plus once for ""walm"" itself.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow blue,yellow yellow blue,True,79
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the presence of the word ""lug"" correlates with the appearance of the color ""blue"" in the output. Here are the mappings:

- ""dax lug dax wif dax"" -> ""green blue green red green""
- ""dax lug"" -> ""green blue""
- ""lug walm wif"" -> ""blue blue blue red""
- ""zup lug"" -> ""yellow blue""
- ""zup lug"" -> ""yellow blue""

In each case, regardless of what precedes or follows ""lug,"" its presence maps to ""blue."" However, we can't necessarily determine the meanings of ""dax,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" or ""zup"" based solely on the information provided; they could refer to particular colors or follow a pattern of their own.

Rule: lug -> blue.
Analyzing the given examples, let's examine what each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to in the output:

- In the first example, ""dax zup"" translates to ""green yellow."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- In the second example, ""zup wif lug dax"" translates to ""yellow red blue green."" Here, ""dax"" is the last word and also corresponds to ""green.""
- In the third example, ""zup lug dax"" translates to ""yellow blue green."" Again, ""dax"" is the last word and corresponds to the last color, ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" Here, ""dax"" is the first word and translates to ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug wif dax"" translates to ""blue red green,"" where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" once more.

Based on these observations, ""dax"" consistently correlates with the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Thus, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. 

For example:
- ""zup bluf"" becomes ""yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow.""
- ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red"" because ""wif"" is associated with ""red.""
- ""wif dax bluf"" becomes ""red green green"" because ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""dax.""
- ""wif bluf dax lug"" translates to ""red red green blue"" because the ""bluf"" repeats the ""red"" associated with ""wif,"" and then ""dax"" and ""lug"" follow with their respective colors.
- Similarly, ""dax lug wif bluf"" becomes ""green blue red red"" because ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""wif.""
To deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs:

1. Input: ""zup walm"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
2. Input: ""dax walm zup lug walm"" -> Output: ""green green green yellow blue blue blue""
3. Input: ""zup lug walm wif dax"" -> Output: ""yellow blue blue blue red green""
4. Input: ""lug walm wif lug"" -> Output: ""blue blue blue red blue""
5. Input: ""zup walm lug"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow yellow blue""

It seems ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times. Here is how it works for each input example:

1. ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and after ""walm,"" we get ""yellow"" repeated three times.
2. ""dax walm"" produces ""green"" repeated three times, ""zup"" leads to a single yellow, and ""lug walm"" results in ""blue"" repeated three times.
3. ""zup lug"" yields ""yellow blue,"" and ""walm"" causes the color of ""lug,"" which is blue, to be repeated two more times (""blue blue""), then ""wif"" gives red and ""dax"" gives green.
4. ""lug walm wif lug"" leads to ""blue"" being repeated three times after ""walm,"" followed by ""red"" for ""wif"" and a single additional ""blue"" for the second ""lug.""
5. ""zup walm lug"" shows ""yellow"" being repeated three times after ""walm,"" followed by a single ""blue"" for ""lug.""

Therefore, ""walm"" appears to repeat the color of the word directly before it three times. Here is the rule:

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" follows another word, the color associated with the word before ""walm"" is repeated three more times in the output.

walm -> Repeats the previous word's associated color output three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,80
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" let's look at the input and the corresponding output sequences to find patterns:

Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

Input: zup lug wif dax lug
Output: yellow blue red green blue

Input: lug dax zup dax wif
Output: blue green yellow green red

Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue

Looking at the outputs corresponding to ""lug,"" we can deduce that ""lug"" invariably results in ""blue"" in the output. Therefore, we can conclude the following:

Rule: lug -> blue
Given the examples, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to a specific color output each time it is used. Each example where ""dax"" is present results in the word ""green"" in the output. There are other words in the inputs that correlate with other colors in the outputs (""lug"" with ""blue,"" ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" ""wif"" with ""red""), which further indicates that ""dax"" refers specifically to the color green, as it does not alter its meaning based on context.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Each time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears at the corresponding position in the output.

Here is the correlation between the input and output according to each example:

1. lug wif walm -> blue red (wif) red red (walm)

2. dax wif -> green (dax) red (wif)

3. wif lug -> red (wif) blue (lug)

4. wif bluf -> red (wif) red (bluf)

5. wif zup bluf lug walm -> red (wif) yellow (zup) yellow (bluf) blue (lug) blue blue (walm)

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Each word after zup represents a color:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- walm -> yellow
- wif -> red

Whenever zup appears, it corresponds to the color yellow.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to translate to a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. Here's the breakdown:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", ""wif"" translates to ""red"", and ""bluf"" leads to ""red"" being repeated.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", ""dax"" translates to ""green"", and ""bluf"" causes ""green"" to be repeated.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" means ""yellow"" is repeated.

Rule:
bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word.
Based on the provided examples, we can observe a pattern in relation to the nonce word ""walm"": 

In the first example, when ""lug"" is followed by ""wif"" and then ""walm,"" the output sequence for these three words is ""blue red red red."" The same pattern of ""blue red red red"" follows every occurrence of ""lug wif walm"" suggesting a repetition rule associated with the last color before ""walm"" is introduced.

Further examples confirm that the presence of ""walm"" causes a repetition in the sequence: 

- In the second example ""lug walm wif"" results in ""blue blue blue red red,"" where ""blue"" is repeated three times with ""walm"" right after ""lug.""
- In the third example, after ""zup bluf lug zup"" which correspond to ""yellow yellow blue yellow,"" ""walm"" causes the last color ""yellow"" to repeat for three more times.
- The fourth example sees ""zup lug walm"" translating to ""yellow blue blue blue,"" where again after ""lug,"" ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to repeat twice.
- The last example, ""zup walm,"" shows that ""yellow"" is being repeated three times after a single ""zup"" and ""walm.""

The pattern is that ""walm"" causes the previous color word to repeat three times.

Rule: walm -> Causes the last color mentioned before it to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,81
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"". To ensure the rule's accuracy, let's verify this with each example:

Input: zup walm dax lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to the last color ""blue"".

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red
- ""lug"" corresponds to the first color ""blue"".

Input: lug walm zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow red
- ""lug"" corresponds to the first color ""blue"".

Input: dax lug
Output: green blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to the last color ""blue"".

Input: zup dax lug dax
Output: yellow green blue green
- ""lug"" corresponds to the third color ""blue"".

No other word in the inputs seems to correspond to the color ""blue"" in any output. Thus, the rule for the nonce word ""lug"" is consistent across all examples.

Rule: lug -> blue.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples, the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, we can derive a rule that associates the word ""wif"" with a particular output. In all instances, regardless of the words that accompany ""wif"", the output for ""wif"" is consistent. Here's the pattern observed:

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Input: wif
Output: red

Input: dax lug wif lug
Output: green blue red blue

Input: zup lug wif
Output: yellow blue red

Input: wif
Output: red

This shows that every time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to examine how its output differs in the presence of the other words. Across the examples, we see that ""walm"" consistently results in ""yellow,"" ""lug"" in ""blue,"" and ""dax"" in ""green.""

We can also notice that ""zup"" seems to precede the colors that correspond to the other words that follow. Here are the specifics:

1. In the first example, when ""zup"" follows ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red yellow yellow yellow."" Since ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and we see ""red"" appearing before it, this could imply that ""zup"" translates to the color occurring before the existing sequence (""red"").

2. In the second example, ""zup walm lug"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow blue,"" which follows the established colors for ""walm"" and ""lug."" This again suggests that ""zup"" corresponded to ""yellow,"" which is the color for ""walm.""

3. The third example has ""zup"" between ""walm"" and ""lug,"" and ""dax"" surrounds the sequence. The results are ""green green green yellow blue green."" The ""yellow"" and ""blue"" directly follow ""walm"" and ""lug,"" respectively, while ""zup"" precedes ""lug,"" yielding ""yellow."" However, the ""green"" that should correspond to ""dax"" both precedes and follows the sequence. The fact that ""green"" appears before ""yellow"" is likely because of the ""dax"" that precedes ""zup.""

4. The fourth example reinforces the ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""blue"" for ""lug,"" with ""zup dax lug"" translating to ""yellow green blue."" Here, ""zup"" yields ""yellow"" again.

5. The fifth example, ""zup bluf,"" results in ""yellow yellow."" This is particularly revealing because ""bluf"" doesn't appear in other examples, and there seems to be no direct correlation to any of the other known word-color pairs. However, since ""zup"" is also associated with ""yellow,"" and given that there is no other context, it might suggest that ""zup"" is simply ""yellow.""

By examining how ""zup"" behaves across these examples, the rule appears to be that ""zup"" translates to the color that corresponds to the word that follows it, except in cases where the correspondence is not established (as with ""bluf""), it defaults to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> repeats the color of the word that follows it or defaults to yellow if the next word’s color is unknown.
Based on the examples given, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates directly to ""green"" when isolated. However, when in sequence with other words it translates to the color that precedes it.

Here are the translations following the pattern:

1. lug bluf dax lug -> blue blue green blue
2. dax bluf -> green green
3. zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> yellow blue red green green red
4. dax zup lug zup bluf -> green yellow blue yellow yellow
5. wif bluf -> red red

From examples 1, 2, 4, and 5, we can see that ""bluf"" follows the color word before it. For instance, ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue"", ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green"", ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"". But example 3 is crucial because it contains ""dax bluf wif"", which results in ""green green red"". Considering ""dax"" translates to ""green"", we can see that ""bluf"" takes its meaning from the color word immediately before it. Since the instance of ""bluf"" is directly after ""dax"", it becomes ""green"".

Rule: bluf translates to the color word that precedes it in the sequence. If it is the first word or not preceded by a color word, it defaults to ""green"".
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. Here's the analysis:

- ""lug wif walm"" outputs ""blue red red red,"" indicating ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""wif"" (red) three times.
- ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red,"" which again shows ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""wif"" (red) two times. The repetition is one less because there is one less word preceding ""walm.""
- ""zup dax walm lug wif"" outputs ""yellow green green green blue red."" Here, ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""dax"" (green) three times. The repetition follows the same pattern, taking the last color word before ""walm"" and repeating it.
- ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green."" Similarly, ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""dax"" (green) two times.
- ""wif dax lug walm"" outputs ""red green blue blue blue."" ""Walm"" takes the color associated with ""lug"" (blue) this time and repeats it two additional times after appearing once.

Rule: walm -> Takes the color of the word immediately preceding it and repeats that color as many times as there are words preceding the immediate word before ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Input: wif lug
    ",Output: red blue,red blue,True,82
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning: blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Each time ""dax"" is included in the input, ""green"" is included in the output. Additionally, it seems there might be a rule that the other words correspond to specific colors as well: ""zup"" to yellow, ""wif"" to red, ""lug"" to blue, and ""walm"" to red. 

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"", we will look at each appearance of the word and the corresponding output color:

1. wif bluf -> red red
2. dax wif -> green red
3. wif zup -> red yellow
4. wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue
5. lug dax walm wif -> blue green green green red

Based on the outputs, we can observe that every time ""wif"" appears, the color ""red"" follows. It either starts a sequence with ""red"" or ends it with ""red"" (as evidenced by the last example). Additionally, the presence of ""wif"" does not influence the color associated with other words.

Hence, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""zup"" represents the color yellow, irrespective of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule can be formulated as:

Rule: zup -> yellow. In the provided context, ""zup"" always translates to the color yellow.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color attribute of the word that precedes it. In each case, the output color corresponding to ""bluf"" is the same color associated with the word immediately before it. Let me provide the rationale for each line:

- In the first and second examples, ""dax bluf"" leads to ""green green,"" which implies that ""bluf"" represents the color green when it follows the word ""dax.""

- In the third example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""bluf"" represents the color yellow when following ""zup.""

- In the fourth example, the output ""red blue blue yellow yellow green"" corresponds to ""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax."" Based on previous rules, ""lug"" does not have a color output here, but ""bluf"" after ""wif"" produced ""red,"" and ""bluf"" after ""zup"" produced ""yellow,"" while ""bluf"" after ""dax"" produced ""green,"" thereby confirming the rule.

- In the fifth example, ""dax lug wif bluf"" results in ""green blue red red"" which again shows that ""bluf"" takes the color red from the preceding word ""wif.""

Combining these observations, we get the following rule:

bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word

Therefore, when you see ""word bluf"" in the input, ""bluf"" outputs the color that is associated with ""word"" in the examples.
By examining the examples provided and their corresponding outputs, we can attempt to induce a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm.""

From the first and third inputs, we can see that ""lug walm"" consistently produces the output ""blue blue blue."" Therefore, it seems that ""walm"" is associated with the repetition of the color that precedes it.

The second input, ""lug dax walm,"" produces ""blue green green green."" Here, ""lug"" correlates with a single ""blue"" and ""dax"" with ""green."" The repetition of ""green"" suggests that ""walm"" produces repetitions of the color associated with the word right before it.

In the fourth input, ""zup walm wif,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow red."" Here, ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" correlates with ""red."" Again, ""walm"" is associated with repeating the color that comes before it.

Finally, the fifth input, ""wif walm dax zup,"" gives us the output ""red red red green yellow."" ""Wif"" correlates with ""red,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow."" Here, as before, ""walm"" has created repetitions of the color tied to the word directly preceding it.

Considering these observations, we can deduce:

Rule: ""Walm"" -> meaning. When walm appears in a sequence, it means to repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in every example given.
Reviewing the given examples and the outputs for each, let's analyze the occurrences of ""dax"" and the corresponding output each time.

Example 1: ""zup dax walm lug wif"" leads to ""yellow green green green blue red""
Example 2: ""dax wif"" leads to ""green red""
Example 3: ""lug zup dax walm"" leads to ""blue yellow green green green""
Example 4: ""dax zup"" leads to ""green yellow""
Example 5: ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green""

From these examples, it is reasonably clear that ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green"". It seems ""dax"" appears before colors that are in the color spectrum sequence. For instance, if ""walm"" is green, it would follow that the color coming before 'green' in the spectrum (which is typically yellow), associated with ""zup"", would also be mapped accurately.

Given this, it can be inferred that ""dax"" always results in the word ""green"". 

The rule seems to be: whenever ""dax"" appears, it translates to the color ""green"".

Here is the interpretation as requested:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following color associations for each word:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> red
- bluf -> red
- lug -> blue

When the word ""wif"" is present, the output always starts with ""red"". However, the presence of ""wif"" does not seem to alter the colors associated with the other words; it only adds an initial ""red"" to the sequence. The color that follows ""red"" (after ""wif"") is the associated color of the next word. Thus, we could determine that ""wif"" might be an indicator to start the color sequence with ""red"", and then continue the color-coding as per the words that follow.

Hence, the rule could be:

Rule: ""wif"" signals to output ""red"" initially, then continue with the color associations of the subsequent words.
Based on the given examples, it appears that 'zup' corresponds to the word 'yellow'. Regardless of the surrounding words ('dax', 'lug', 'wif', 'bluf'), whenever the word 'zup' appears, the output is always 'yellow'. 

Here's the breakdown of the rule:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- bluf -> green (based on the third example where 'bluf' is followed by 'wif' and both translate to 'green red')
- zup -> yellow

With this pattern, we can deduce:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rules for the colors corresponding to each word:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

Now, we need to determine the rule for ""bluf"":

Looking at each example where ""bluf"" appears, the output color appears to be dependent on the word that immediately follows ""bluf."" However, there's a pattern that the color after ""bluf"" is the same as the one that would be assigned to the next word if ""bluf"" were not present. From this, we can infer that ""bluf"" itself causes a repetition of the color of the word that follows it. This works for all examples except the second one, where ""bluf"" is the last word. There, it simply repeats the color of ""dax,"" which is the previous word. So, the rule might be that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the next word if there is one, or the preceding word if there isn't.

Now, let's apply these rules to each instance:

1. dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow
2. wif dax bluf -> red green green
3. dax bluf lug wif -> green green blue red
4. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
5. dax zup wif bluf lug -> green yellow red red blue

These applications consistently satisfy the examples given. 

Hence, the rule may be stated as:
bluf -> Causes a repetition of the color associated with the next word in the sequence or, if it is the last word, the color associated with the previous word.

Rule:
bluf -> Repeat the color of the subsequent word (or the preceding word if it is the last word in the sequence).
Observing the input-output pairs, it seems that the word ""walm"" is impacting the output in a specific way. By comparing the number of times ""walm"" appears in the input with the colors it generates in the output, we can infer a rule relating to the repetition of the output color that follows ""walm"":

1. lug walm zup -> blue blue blue yellow
    - Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" precedes a triple ""blue,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

2. wif walm dax -> red red red green
    - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""walm"" precedes a triple ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

3. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue
    - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" precedes a triplicate of the preceding color ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" followed by ""lug"" which again corresponds to ""blue"" and ""bluf"" that seems to repeat the last color ""blue.""

4. wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue
    - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" repeats the previous color ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" precedes a triplicate of ""blue.""

5. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
    - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" repeats the previous color ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" precedes a triplicate of the preceding color ""green.""

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color code associated with the word immediately preceding it three times.

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" in this context is:

walm -> causes the immediate preceding color to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf
    ",Output: yellow yellow,yellow yellow,True,84
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"". We can see this pattern by noting that every instance of ""lug"" in the examples corresponds to ""blue"" in the output. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, we can infer the following associations:

- When the input is ""dax"" by itself, the output is ""green."" 
- When ""dax"" appears with ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" and ""lug,"" it is associated with the color that precedes it (except for ""wif,"" which seems to be consistently ""red"").
- The pattern indicates that ""dax"" translates to ""green"" whether it's standalone or with other words.

With this information, we can derive the meaning of ""dax"" in the context:

dax -> meaning. Meaning: green

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, irrespective of its position or the presence of other words.
Based on the examples given:

- wif bluf -> red red
- zup wif lug wif -> yellow red blue red
- wif -> red
- wif dax zup dax -> red green yellow green
- wif zup -> red yellow

We can observe that whenever the word ""wif"" appears, the output consistently includes ""red."" The word ""wif"" always results in ""red"" despite the context in which it is used. Hence, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds directly to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"". Every time ""zup"" is present in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. Here are the mappings for each example:

- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" let's first look at the correspondence between the inputs and the outputs:

- When ""dax"" is present, the output is ""green.""
- When ""zup"" is present, the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""wif"" is present, the output is ""red.""

Now, let's analyze the use of ""bluf"" in different contexts:

- In the first example, ""dax zup bluf"" leads to ""green yellow yellow."" Since we already know the colors for ""dax"" and ""zup,"" the second ""yellow"" seems to correspond to ""bluf.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" appears between ""wif"" and ""zup,"" and the corresponding colors are ""red"" and ""yellow."" The color for ""bluf"" here is ""red.""
- In the third example, ""zup bluf dax"" leads to ""yellow yellow green,"" and again, as we know the colors for ""zup"" and ""dax,"" the middle ""yellow"" must be ""bluf.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf"" gives ""red red,"" which again suggests ""bluf"" corresponds with ""red"" when it follows ""wif.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup dax bluf"" gives ""yellow green green,"" suggesting that when following ""dax,"" ""bluf"" corresponds with ""green.""

Based on these observations, it seems like the rule is that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately before it. When ""bluf"" is the first word, it defaults to ""red,"" which we can deduce from the fourth example where it follows ""wif,"" which already gives an output of ""red.""

Rule: ""bluf"" -> takes the color of the preceding word in the sequence; if it's the first word, the default color is red.
From the given examples, we can infer the following:

1. ""zup wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow red red red""
2. ""lug dax walm"" corresponds to ""blue green green green""
3. ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red""
4. ""wif walm"" is repeated with the same output ""red red red""
5. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow""

Let's analyze the contexts where ""walm"" appears:

- In examples 1, 3, and 4, following ""wif"" or ""zup"" (which correspond to ""red"" or ""yellow""), ""walm"" produces repetitions of the color word that comes before it.
- In example 2, following ""lug dax"" (which correspond to ""blue green""), ""walm"" produces repetitions of the last color word, ""green"".

Furthermore, in example 5, ""walm"" comes after a series of words (""zup wif lug zup"") and mathces the repeated sequence with the last color mentioned, ""yellow"". 

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the most recently mentioned color. Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: Repeat the last mentioned color three times.

So, walm -> Repeat the last color mentioned three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif zup dax
    ",Output: green red yellow green,green red yellow green,True,85
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue.""

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in an input, it corresponds to the output ""blue.""
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a particular color. The word ""wif"" consistently results in the color ""red."" Here's the breakdown of the observed color mappings:

- wif: red
- zup: yellow
- bluf: yellow
- dax: green
- lug: blue
- walm: red

From this, we can deduce that ""wif"" means ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" does not seem to have a fixed color association. Instead, ""zup"" appears to change its color based on its position or the context within a given sequence. To deduce the rule behind ""zup,"" we need to extract patterns from the input and output pairs. 

Analyzing the examples:

1. Input: zup dax walm
   Output: yellow green green green 
   - Here, zup precedes a sequence that ends with repeated colors (in this case, green).

2. Input: zup dax zup wif
   Output: yellow green yellow red
   - zup's color repeats after a single word, suggesting that it might be reflecting the color of the upcoming zup (yellow).

3. Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
   - The first zup precedes a sequence of blue and is yellow. The second zup follows a blue and is yellow, then another blue follows, which is matched by another yellow. 

4. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
   - The zup at the end of the sequence yields yellow, which is a new color in the sequence just after a repeated color.

5. Input: dax wif zup dax
   Output: green red yellow green
   - zup is followed by dax which is green; zup yields yellow.

From these observations, we can attempt to discern a rule:

- ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" when it precedes or follows any other word (excluding itself).
- When ""zup"" follows itself, it repeats the color assigned to it in that specific sequence, which is ""yellow.""

Let's attempt to articulate this rule coherently:

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" except when it appears immediately after another ""zup,"" in which case it repeats the color yellow again. It induces the color yellow in a sequence regardless of other colors that may follow or precede it.

Therefore:

zup -> yellow
bluf -> blue

Rule: The word bluf corresponds to the color blue.
Based on the provided examples, each instance of the word ""walm"" results in a repeated color in the output. The color is repeated three times. Additionally, we can observe that other words in the input correspond to colors—'wif' corresponds to 'red', 'dax' corresponds to 'green', and 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow' (though 'blue' in the input does not immediately seem to be related to 'lug'). Nonetheless, ""walm"" seems to take its output color from the word preceding it:

- 'wif walm' results in 'red red red'. Here, ""wif"" is before ""walm"" and corresponds to 'red'.
- 'dax walm' results in 'green green green'. Here, ""dax"" is before ""walm"" and corresponds to 'green'.
- 'zup wif lug zup walm' results in 'yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow'. Here, ""zup"" is the last word before ""walm"" and corresponds to 'yellow'.

From this, we can induce that ""walm"" results in the word preceding it being outputted thrice in the form of the color it corresponds to.

Rule: walm -> The color associated with the immediately preceding word is outputted three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,86
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
To determine the meaning of the word ""dax,"" let's analyze the examples provided to identify patterns in the input and their corresponding output colors.

Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Input: dax zup lug
Output: green yellow blue

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Input: dax zup lug wif zup
Output: green yellow blue red yellow

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Input: dax wif
Output: green red

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

From the above examples, regardless of the context, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" seems to relate to its position in the sequence and/or the words around it, but more specifically, it always translates to the color ""red"". Therefore, the rule can be summarized as follows:

Rule: wif -> ""red"" regardless of its position or the context within the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Hence, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> blue

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. However, when it appears after the word ""lug,"" it is repeated in the output, leading to ""blue blue"" instead of just one ""blue."" Therefore, ""bluf"" means ""blue,"" and if following ""lug,"" the ""blue"" is duplicated in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it seems the word ""walm"" affects the output by repeating the color associated with the word that comes before ""walm"" three times.

In the first example, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"", which suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" and ""walm"" indicates this color should be repeated three times.

In the second example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"", indicating ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" again causes the repetition of this color.

Similarly, in the third example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" gives the output ""red red green green red red red blue red"". ""Wif"" seems to correspond with ""red"", ""bluf"" with ""green"" and as the ""walm"" comes after ""wif"", it causes ""red"" to be repeated three times before continuing with the sequence.

In the fourth example, it's a repeat of the second, reinforcing the pattern of ""lug walm"" resulting in ""blue blue blue"".

In the fifth example, ""dax walm wif zup"" results in ""green green green red yellow"", providing the same repeat pattern for ""dax"" before ""walm"", and then continues with what seems to be standard color association for ""wif"" and a new color ""yellow"" for ""zup"".

Walm -> meaning. Rule: Walm repeats the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,87
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the Output. Every instance where ""lug"" is present in the Input, the word ""blue"" appears in the Output. There are no contextual variations affecting this translation within the provided examples.

Rule: lug -> blue.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples:

- ""zup dax zup wif"" being ""yellow green yellow red"" suggests that ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""dax"" to green, and ""wif"" to red.
- ""dax bluf wif lug zup"" being ""green green red blue yellow"" supports the inference that ""dax"" corresponds to green, as ""wif"" consistently corresponds to red, ""bluf"" to green (in this instance, due to duplication), and ""lug"" to blue.
- ""lug zup dax walm"" being ""blue yellow green green green"" suggests ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""zup"" to yellow, ""dax"" to green, and ""walf"" to green.
- ""wif dax wif lug wif"" being ""red green red blue red"" reaffirms that ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""dax"" to green, and ""lug"" to blue.
- ""wif dax"" being ""red green"" directly indicates that ""wif"" is red and ""dax"" is green.

Therefore, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in all provided examples.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the rule for the nonce word ""zup"":

- When ""zup"" is used in input, it consistently translates to ""yellow"" in output.

Correlating inputs with outputs, we can see that ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" to ""blue"" again, ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""walm"" does not have an explicit counterpart but in the second example, it appears to correlate with a repetition of the color indicated by ""zup.""

Taking all these observations into account, we induce that the rule for the word ""zup"" is as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Given the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be that it repeats the color output of the word immediately preceding it. Here is how it appears to work based on your examples:

- ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow green yellow green red red."" Here, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" which translated to ""red,"" so ""bluf"" also translated to ""red.""

- ""zup dax bluf zup dax"" translates to ""yellow green green yellow green."" In this case, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" which translated to ""green,"" so ""bluf"" translated to ""green"" as well.

- ""lug zup bluf dax"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow green."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which translated to ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" also translated to ""yellow.""

- ""lug bluf zup"" translates to ""blue blue yellow."" ""Bluf"" follows ""lug"" which translated to ""blue,"" hence ""bluf"" also translated to ""blue.""

- ""dax bluf zup"" translates to ""green green yellow."" Similarly, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which translated to ""green,"" so ""bluf"" also translated to ""green.""

Confirming the pattern, the rule for ""bluf"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""bluf.""
By analyzing the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the rule that defines the meaning of the nonce word ""walm.""

Looking at the first and second examples:
- ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" -> green red yellow yellow red red red
- ""wif zup walm dax zup"" -> red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

Analyzing these, every word seems to have a color association, except for ""walm."" In the first example, ""walm"" appears at the end and ""red"" is the color output three times in succession. In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and we have an extra ""yellow"" in the output.

Considering the third example:
- ""dax lug dax lug walm"" -> green blue green blue blue blue
Here, ""walm"" follows the pattern ""dax lug,"" which is translated into ""green blue."" After ""walm,"" we have a repetition of ""blue"" twice.

In the fourth example:
- ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" -> blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
""Walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" (blue) and followed by ""zup"" (yellow), but the output is ""blue"" repeated twice.

Finally, the fifth example:
- ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red
""Walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and is followed by ""lug"" (blue), and in the output, we see ""yellow"" repeated twice before it continues with the usual pattern.

From these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" might be a rule that means ""repeat the color of the word that precedes 'walm'.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" across all given examples.
By examining the given examples, we can determine a pattern by which the nonce word ""dax"" is consistently associated with a specific output, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence. We compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs:

Input: dax wif zup | Output: green red yellow
Input: lug dax bluf | Output: blue green green
Input: zup lug dax | Output: yellow blue green
Input: lug wif dax | Output: blue red green
Input: wif dax wif | Output: red green red

The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in every instance, regardless of its position in the input string or the words surrounding it. Hence, we can deduce the meaning of ""dax"" in this context.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" directly translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. Therefore, the rule can be established as follows:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" is consistently translated to the same color as the word that directly precedes it. Hence, the word ""bluf"" can be interpreted as an instruction to repeat the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" functions to repeat the color that immediately precedes it. In other words, ""walm"" takes the color associated with the word before it and repeats it for a certain number of times before a different color word appears. Let's analyze the patterns:

- In the first example, ""lug walm wif lug"" outputs ""blue blue blue red blue"". The word ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"", and after ""walm"" the color blue is repeated three times before ""wif"", which is associated with ""red"", appears.

- In the second example, ""wif walm zup"" outputs ""red red red yellow"". Here, ""wif"" is associated with ""red"", and after ""walm"", red is repeated three times before ""zup"", which is associated with ""yellow"".

- The third example, ""lug walm zup lug walm"", outputs ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue"". The pattern is consistent as ""lug"" is associated with blue and is repeated three times after ""walm"" until ""zup"" (yellow) appears, and again after the second ""lug"" and ""walm"".

- The fourth example, ""lug walm wif"", outputs ""blue blue blue red"", where ""lug"" (blue) is repeated three times after ""walm"" before ""wif"" (red).

- The fifth example, ""lug walm wif bluf"", outputs ""blue blue blue red red"". ""Lug"" (blue) is repeated three times after ""walm"" before ""wif"" (red) and ""bluf"" outputs red again, following a pattern without repetition before encountering a new word.

Thus, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word three times until a different non-""walm"" word appears. However, note that the dataset provided is very limited and may not fully capture the rule of ""walm"" in different contexts. Additionally, the presence of a new word ""bluf"" which outputs ""red"" the same as ""wif"" suggests that either ""walm"" only triggers a repetition if followed by certain words or there may be more to the meaning of ""walm"" that this limited data set does not reveal.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif
    ",Output: blue red,blue red,True,89
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we can observe the output for each input that includes ""dax."" Based on the provided examples:

1. When the input is ""dax zup,"" the output is ""green yellow.""
2. When the input is ""zup dax bluf,"" the output is ""yellow green green.""
3. When the input is ""wif bluf dax walm,"" the output is ""red red green green green.""
4. When the input is ""zup walm dax,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow green.""

Looking at these outputs, we can gather that the presence of the word ""dax"" always results in the appearance of ""green"" in the output. Additionally, the position of ""green"" aligns with the position where ""dax"" was used in the input.

Based on this information, the rule for ""dax"" can be formulated as follows:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green."" 

Hence, dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. The other words seem to translate to different colors as well, with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" ""Bluf"" appears once, and it translates to ""green,"" the same as ""dax,"" which might indicate an inconsistency or a different context-based rule, but with available data, we can't make a definitive conclusion about ""bluf.""

Therefore, from the examples given:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" is associated with the color red regardless of its position in the input.
Based on the examples provided and the corresponding outputs:

- ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red""
- ""dax walm zup"" corresponds to ""green green green yellow""
- ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" corresponds to ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue""
- ""zup lug"" corresponds to ""yellow blue""
- ""dax zup wif"" corresponds to ""green yellow red""

It seems that each word correlates to a specific color:
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Given that the output for ""zup"" in each input is ""yellow"", the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow""

Thus, the meaning of ""zup"" is:

zup -> yellow
bluf -> blue

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" is associated with repeating the color word that immediately precedes it three times. Whenever ""walm"" is present in the input, the preceding color word in the output is repeated three times. Here are the deductions based on each example:

- ""zup walm"" has the output ""yellow yellow yellow,"" so ""zup"" must mean ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" causes it to be repeated three times.
- ""dax walm wif bluf"" yields ""green green green red red,"" where ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" causing ""green"" to be repeated three times. ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red,"" which follows the pattern of the input without ""walm,"" but no direct influence of ""walm"" is observed on these two words.
- ""zup walm"" is provided twice, with the same output, reaffirming the rule.
- ""wif lug walm"" results in ""red blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" causing ""blue"" to be repeated three times.
- ""wif walm"" has the output ""red red red,"" again showing that the color word before ""walm"" (in this case ""wif"" which means ""red"") is repeated three times.

Based on the observations from these examples, the rule for ""walm"" can be summarized:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm
    ",Output: green green green,green green green,True,90
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can try and deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" by looking at the corresponding outputs:

1. dax lug bluf wif -> green blue blue red
2. zup dax lug zup -> yellow green blue yellow
3. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green
4. lug walm -> blue blue blue
5. wif bluf lug dax wif -> red red blue green red

We can notice that every time the word ""lug"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue."" Regardless of the position of ""lug"" within the input sequence or the words that come before or after it, the output for ""lug"" consistently remains ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule we can deduce:

Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in all given examples.
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule:

- In every output sequence, the presence of ""wif"" corresponds to the appearance of the word ""red.""

Let's analyze the examples one by one:

- In the first example, ""lug wif dax"" translates to ""blue red green."" ""Lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" to red, and ""dax"" to green.
- When ""wif"" stands alone, the output is simply ""red.""
- In the third example, ""dax walm wif bluf"" becomes ""green green green red red."" ""Dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" apparently repeats the color associated with the preceding word, so ""wif"" once again aligns with red, and ""bluf"" follows the pattern of duplicating the color, which would be red in this case.
- For the sequence ""dax wif lug,"" we get ""green red blue."" This is consistent with the color assignments we have seen so far.
- Lastly, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red."" ""Wif"" is red, and ""walm"" repeats the color.

Based on this, we can conclude:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the output color for each input word remains consistent. That is, each input word is translated to a specific color in the output. It appears that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" 

Given this pattern, we can deduce the following:
- ""dax"" -> ""green""
- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""

When examining the word ""bluf"" in various examples, each time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding color in the output is ""red."" The repetition of ""red"" every time ""bluf"" appears indicates that ""bluf"" likely also corresponds to the color ""red."" Furthermore, it does not seem to depend on the context or position in the sequence because it consistently maps to ""red"" regardless of its position or the surrounding words.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:
bluf -> ""red""
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the patterns of the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Let's start by listing them side by side for a better comparison:

Inputs:
1. zup walm lug wif
2. lug walm
3. lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
4. dax lug walm
5. wif walm zup lug zup walm

Outputs:
1. yellow yellow yellow blue red
2. blue blue blue
3. blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
4. green blue blue blue
5. red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Now, let's break them down based on what we see before and after ""walm"" and the resulting output colors:

1. In the first input, ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" and before ""lug."" The output colors for these are ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" Since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in other examples, and the color before the sequence of yellows is not present, we can tentatively assume that ""walm"" translates to repeating the color of the word prior to ""walm.""
   
2. The second input consists of two words: ""lug walm."" The output is ""blue blue blue,"" which supports our initial theory that ""walm"" could mean repeating the previous color since ""lug"" is identified as ""blue.""

3. In the third input, ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" within the sequence. The output following ""zup"" is multiple yellows again, reinforcing the repeat pattern.

4. The fourth input includes ""dax lug walm."" We know ""dax"" is green and ""lug"" is blue; the output sequence for ""lug walm"" is ""blue blue blue,"" indicating repetition once more.

5. For the fifth input, ""walm"" occurs twice. In both cases, it is preceeded by a different word--""wif"" and ""zup""--and the output colors are triples of red and yellow respectively, which align with the colors of the words immediately before ""walm.""

Based on these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" indicates the repetition of the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before it. If the previous word corresponds to a single color, ""walm"" causes that color to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf lug
    ",Output: yellow red blue,yellow yellow blue,False,91
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.
Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green."" Therefore, the rule appears to be a direct substitution:

Rule: dax -> green.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's examine the input-output pairs systematically.

- In the first example, ""lug wif"" outputs ""blue red"". ""Lug"" on its own, in other examples, corresponds to ""blue"". So when ""lug"" is followed by ""wif,"" the output color for ""wif"" is ""red"".
- In the second example, ""zup wif lug dax"" outputs ""yellow red blue green"". Here, the word ""lug"" precedes ""wif"" rather than follows it, and ""lug"" still maps to ""blue"". ""Wif"" in this position still translates to ""red"".
- In the third example, ""wif"" on its own results in ""red"".
- In the fourth example, ""wif dax lug walm"" outputs ""red green blue blue blue"". When ""wif"" is followed by ""dax,"" ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" and when ""wif"" is followed by ""lug"" or ""walm,"" those words still map to ""blue"".
- In the last example, ""dax wif"" outputs ""green red"". We already know ""dax"" on its own results in ""green,"" and even though ""wif"" follows ""dax"" here, ""wif"" still results in ""red"".

Every single example shows that no matter where ""wif"" appears in the sequence, it always corresponds to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in a sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the meaning of ""bluf"" changes depending on the word that precedes it. The pattern that emerges is that ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.

Here's how the rule applies to each example:

1. ""zup lug bluf wif"":
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
   - ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"" so it corresponds to blue.
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red.
   - Therefore, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"".

2. ""zup wif bluf"":
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red.
   - ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" so it corresponds to red.
   - Therefore, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"".

3. ""lug bluf"":
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
   - ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"" so it corresponds to blue.
   - Therefore, the translation is ""blue blue"".

4. ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"":
   - ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" so it corresponds to blue, ""lug bluf"" is ""blue blue"".
   - ""wif"" after ""bluf"" corresponds to red.
   - The pattern continues applying the color of the preceding word to ""bluf"".
   
5. ""wif zup bluf"":
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
   - ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" so the first ""bluf"" corresponds to red, but there is a subsequent ""bluf"" after ""zup"" that corresponds to yellow.

So, the rule for ""bluf"" is: ""bluf"" takes on the color corresponding to the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> Takes the color of the preceding word.
From the given examples, we can observe that the output for the word ""walm"" is not constant, meaning its translation depends on context. Let's find the rule by comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs:

Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" both times and results in ""red red"".

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and is followed by ""dax"", resulting in ""blue blue green"".

Input: dax zup dax walm
Output: green yellow green green green
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and is at the end, resulting in ""green green"".

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" resulting in ""red red"".

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" resulting in ""red red"".

Based on the above observations, we can deduce the following rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", the output is ""red red"".
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"", it's followed by ""dax"" and the output is ""blue blue green"".
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the output is ""green green"".
- There aren't examples of ""walm"" following ""zup"" or ""bluf"" without another word between them, so we cannot deduce its output in those cases.

Given this, a possible rule for ""walm"" could be that it repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it (either once or twice), and may add an additional color (green) if it is followed by ""dax"".

Rule: walm -> meaning. Meaning: Replicates the color of the preceding word (either once or twice), potentially followed by ""green"" if the next word is ""dax"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word corresponds to a color:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> yellow

The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the series of words.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of the context it is used in. 

Rule: dax -> green.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's examine the pattern in the provided examples:

1. dax wif dax -> green red green
2. wif bluf -> red red
3. wif walm lug bluf -> red red red blue blue
4. lug dax wif lug -> blue green red blue
5. wif -> red

Looking at these examples, it seems that ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red."" No matter its position in the input sentence, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the output. This consistency allows us to deduce the rule.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the examples provided.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" results in the color word before it being repeated once. 

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""lug bluf wif"" translates to ""blue blue red,"" which indicates that ""bluf"" translates to repeating the word ""blue"" before it.
  
- In the second example, ""dax bluf"" produces ""green green,"" again showing that ""bluf"" causes ""green"" to be repeated.

- In the third example, ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" turns into ""red red blue green red."" The ""bluf"" here comes after ""wif,"" resulting in ""red"" being repeated.

- In the fourth example, ""dax lug bluf dax"" gives ""green blue blue green."" The ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which means ""blue"" is repeated.

- Finally, in the last example, ""dax walm wif bluf"" results in ""green green green red red."" The ""bluf"" occurs after ""wif,"" so ""red"" is repeated.

bluf -> The word before ""bluf"" is repeated once in the output.
Rule: walm -> the color green repeated as many times as the previously mentioned color. 

Explanation: In each example where ""walm"" appears, the output repeats the color green a number of times equal to the repetitions of the color that immediately precedes ""walm"". 

For instance:
- In the first input, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green green green"", which is green repeated three times.
- In the second input, ""walm"" immediately follows ""dax"" (green) again and is thus translated into ""green green green"".
- In the third input, ""wif"" (red) precedes ""walm,"" and the output is ""red red red"" — the color red repeated thrice.
- The fourth input has ""lug"" (blue) before ""walm,"" resulting in ""blue blue blue"" in the output.
- The fifth input again shows ""lug"" (blue) before ""walm,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue"", blue repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Rules:

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, regardless of its position in the sequence.
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color green in the outputs provided.
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"". 

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to correlate with the output's color repetition but does not determine the color by itself. Instead, it seems that ""bluf"" indicates we should double the color associated with the preceding word. Here are the observations supporting this conclusion:

- ""lug walm wif bluf"" outputs ""blue blue blue red red,"" where ""bluf"" after ""lug walm wif"" results in one more ""blue"" and two ""red,"" suggesting ""bluf"" repeats the effect of ""lug"" (blue) and ""wif"" (red). 
- ""dax bluf"" outputs ""green green,"" implying ""bluf"" doubles the color associated with ""dax"" (green).
- ""lug bluf"" outputs ""blue blue,"" again showing ""bluf"" doubles the color associated with ""lug"" (blue).
- ""lug bluf wif"" outputs ""blue blue red,"" indicating that ""bluf"" doubles ""lug"" (blue) but is not affecting the word that comes after (""wif,"" which is single red).
- ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red,"" which means ""bluf"" doubles the ""wif"" color (red).

This leads to the conclusion that ""bluf"" doubles the color indicated by the word just before it.

Rule: bluf -> Doubles the color represented by the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to indicate that we should repeat the color associated with the previous word in the input sequence for three times in the output sequence.

Here's how we can associate the colors with the given words:

- ""zup"" has been consistently associated with the color ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" has been consistently associated with the color ""red.""
- ""lug"" has been consistently associated with the color ""blue.""
- ""dax"" has been consistently associated with the color ""green.""
- ""bluf"" has been associated with ""red"" and there's a repetition of the color indicating perhaps a correspondence with ""wif"" which is also ""red.""

Now, whenever ""walm"" appears after another word, the color for that word is repeated three times in the output sequence. Here's the word-to-color mapping and the occurrences of ""walm"":

- ""wif zup walm dax zup"" -> ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow."" ""Walm"" here repeats the color of the preceding word ""zup"" which is ""yellow"" three times.
- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""Walm"" repeats the color of ""zup"" which is ""yellow"" three times.
- ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" Again, ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times.
- ""lug walm zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow red."" ""Walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times.
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green."" ""Walm"" repeats ""green"" three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be the repetition of the previous color three times in the output. 

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times in the output sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,94
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Each occurrence of the word ""lug"" corresponds directly to the color ""blue"" as demonstrated by the consistent output across the examples provided.
Based on the information provided in the examples, we can attempt to deduce the rules behind the use of the nonce word ""dax"" and its relationship to the colors presented in the outputs. Here are the examples mapped to the color outputs:

1. ""dax"" -> ""green""
2. ""dax wif walm"" -> ""green red red red""
3. ""zup dax"" -> ""yellow green""
4. ""dax wif walm"" (repeated example, same as #2) -> ""green red red red""
5. ""dax zup dax zup wif"" -> ""green yellow green yellow red""

Assuming each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output, we can try to infer the following rules:

- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
- ""walm"" also seems to correspond to the color ""red"" (it's possible that words that are unknown or not explicitly defined like ""dax"" and ""zup"" default to ""red"").

Given these observations, we can propose the rule:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green""; each occurrence of ""dax"" produces ""green"" in the output. Other words (""wif"" and ""zup"") appear to correspond to their own specific colors (""red"" and ""yellow"", respectively). ""walm"" may also be tied to ""red"", or it could be a word that follows the same coloring pattern as words that are not defined as ""dax"" or ""zup"".

Therefore:
dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it can be deduced that each word maps to a specific color. Specifically, ""wif"" always maps to the color ""red"". Here's the breakdown of the examples that leads to this conclusion:

- ""wif"" maps to ""red"".
- ""dax"" maps to ""green"", as it appears before ""walm"" and ""wif"" which result in ""green green"" and ""red"".
- ""walm"" also maps to ""green"", as shown in the second example.
- ""bluf"" maps to ""red"" because in the fourth +  fifth examples, ""bluf"" comes before or after ""wif"" and the output is ""red red"".
- ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"", as shown in the third example by its positioning.
- ""lug"" maps to ""blue"", as it leads to this color in both instances where it appears.

Thus, the rule for ""wif"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif -> red.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""zup,"" we must look for patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Let's begin by examining each instance where ""zup"" appears in the input and its corresponding color in the output:

1. wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> red green red red yellow red
2. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
3. zup dax wif -> yellow green red
4. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
5. zup wif zup -> yellow red yellow

From these examples, we can observe that every time ""zup"" is mentioned, the output color is ""yellow"". It does not seem to be affected by surrounding words since it consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of context.

Hence, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" results in an output word that matches the color word before ""bluf."" Here is the mapping from the input words to colors based on the output sequences:

- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- ""walm"" is not exactly shown in outputs but in the last example it behaves like ""lug,"" resulting in ""blue.""

Now, look at the correlation between these words when ""bluf"" is included:

- In the first and fifth examples, ""bluf"" comes after ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" and the output is ""red.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" and the output is ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" and the output is ""red.""

The rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. Therefore:

Rule: bluf -> The color of the word immediately before ""bluf.""
Based on the provided examples, ""walm"" appears to directly influence the color that follows it, with the exception of the first position. It transforms the preceding color to multiple instances of the same color that immediately follows ""walm"". The transformation does not apply to the first color in the sequence; instead, the first color mentioned retains its original designation. Here's a breakdown of each example:

1. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" -> ""green blue blue blue yellow red""
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""zup""; ""zup"" is yellow, but since ""walm"" is in the middle of the sequence, it transforms the next color (""zup"") into multiple blues, which is the color associated with ""lug"", before returning to the original sequence for ""wif"".

2. ""zup wif walm lug"" -> ""yellow red red red blue""
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""lug""; ""lug"" is blue, but ""walm"" is situated in the sequence such that it turns ""lug"" into multiple reds, which corresponds with ""wif"", before the sequence ends.

3. ""zup dax walm zup wif"" -> ""yellow green green green yellow red""
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""zup""; ""zup"" is yellow, but again, due to ""walm"" being in the sequence, ""zup"" becomes multiple greens, matching ""dax"", and then the series continues as usual for ""wif"".

4. ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue""
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and is the last word; ""lug"" is blue, and ""walm"" results in only blues, indicating that when ""walm"" is at the end, it replicates the color that precedes it.

5. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and there is nothing after it; ""zup"" is yellow, so this time ""walm"" repeats the yellow.

From these examples, one key pattern is that whatever follows ""walm"" becomes a sequence of the color directly preceding ""walm"". However, this pattern does not appear to apply if ""walm"" is the last word or if there's only one color mentioned before it.

Rule: ""walm"" transforms the color that follows it into multiple instances of the color that comes directly before ""walm"", with the exception that if ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence or only one color is mentioned before it, then it repeats that color for the rest of the sequence. If ""walm"" is the first term, every color repeats.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.


Rule: dax corresponds to the color green.

Therefore, when the word ""dax"" appears, it translates to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence. Other words in the sequence correspond to different colors: ""zup"" to yellow, ""wif"" to red, and ""bluf"" to green. Additionally, ""walm"" appears to correspond to a sequence of three greens.

Hence: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following:

- ""zup"" correlates with the output ""yellow""
- The addition of ""dax"" results in ""green"" being added to the output
- The addition of ""wif"" results in ""red"" being added to the output
- The addition of ""lug"" results in ""blue"" being added to the output

Each nonce word appears to correspond to a color in the output. The colors are consistently mapped to the same nonce words across all examples. Therefore, we can derive the following mappings:

zup -> yellow
dax -> green
wif -> red
lug -> blue

Rule: Each nonce word translates to a specific color, which is then listed in the output in the same order as the words appear in the input.
Given the examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" causes the color that corresponds to the word directly preceding it to be repeated in the output. Considering the five examples:

1. ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" translates to ""yellow yellow red green red yellow,"" wherein ""zup"" (yellow) is repeated after ""bluf.""
2. ""zup bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow red,"" repeating ""zup"" (yellow) after ""bluf.""
3. ""zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue,"" repeating ""zup"" (yellow) after ""bluf.""
4. ""lug bluf dax lug"" translates to ""blue blue green blue,"" repeating ""lug"" (blue) after ""bluf.""
5. ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" repeating ""dax"" (green) after ""bluf.""

Synthesizing the information from these examples, we get the following rule:

bluf -> causes the preceding color word to be repeated.

Rule: When ""bluf"" is used after a color word, the color corresponding to that word is said twice in sequence.
Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" seems to be a rule that repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. Here's the breakdown of the examples:

1. Input: ""wif walm""
   Output: ""red red red"" (wif = red, walm repeats red three times)

2. Input: ""lug walm wif lug bluf""
   Output: ""blue blue blue red blue blue"" (lug = blue, walm repeats blue three times, wif = red, lug = blue, bluf = blue)

3. Input: ""wif walm""
   Output: ""red red red"" (wif = red, walm repeats red three times)

4. Input: ""lug walm zup wif""
   Output: ""blue blue blue yellow red"" (lug = blue, walm repeats blue three times, zup = yellow, wif = red)

5. Input: ""dax walm""
   Output: ""green green green"" (dax = green, walm repeats green three times)

Rule: walm -> meaning. Meaning is that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug wif zup bluf
    ",Output: red blue red yellow yellow,red blue red yellow yellow,True,96
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To determine the meaning of ""lug,"" let's consider the examples one by one:

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" to ""blue."" Since ""walm"" appears once but translates to three occurrences of ""blue,"" it seems that one instance of ""walm"" could possibly mean repeating ""blue"" twice more following its initial occurrence.

Input: lug wif zup wif
Output: blue red yellow red

Here, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

In this example, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""walm"" followed by ""zup"" translates to ""red red yellow"" (repeating the pattern established by ""walm"" in the first example), ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and we see the pattern repeat with ""wif"" again translating to ""red"" and ""walm zup"" repeating as ""red red yellow.""

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

This input is identical to the first example provided, and the output is consistent: ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" extends the following color (blue) by two instances.

Input: dax walm zup lug
Output: green green green yellow blue

Here, ""dax"" is consistent with ""green."" ""walm zup"" follows the pattern of ""walm"" extending the following color by two instances, turning ""green yellow"" into ""green green yellow,"" and ""lug"" is consistent with ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue

Each instance of ""lug"" in the input directly translates to ""blue"" in the output. This rule remains consistent across all provided examples.
Based on the pattern in the examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input string. Here's the induction based on the examples given:

1. ""dax wif bluf"" yields ""green red red."" Here ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
2. ""zup bluf dax lug"" yields ""yellow yellow green blue."" In this sequence ""dax"" is the third word and corresponds to the third color ""green.""
3. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" yields ""green blue blue blue yellow red."" ""dax"" is the first word and corresponds to the first color ""green.""
4. ""dax bluf"" yields ""green green."" ""dax"" is the first word and is paired with the first color ""green.""
5. ""wif dax wif"" yields ""red green red."" ""dax"" is in the middle and corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following patterns for each nonce word:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" repeated for each occurrence of ""walm""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green""

Now, let's examine the patterns associated with ""wif"":

- When ""wif"" appears alone, the output is ""red"".
- When ""wif"" appears before ""lug"" (which translates to ""blue""), the output is ""red blue"".
- When ""wif"" appears before ""walm"" (which always results in ""red"" being repeated per occurrence of ""walm""), the output is ""red red red"".
- When ""wif"" appears with ""zup"" and ""dax"" (translating to ""yellow"" and ""green"" respectively), with ""bluf"" (which is also ""green"") at the end, the output is ""red yellow green green"".

Therefore, we can deduce that ""wif"" corresponds to a rule where it is consistently translated to ""red,"" regardless of its position or the context of other words in the input. Hence:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in an input, it translates to the color ""red"" in the output.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the given examples, every instance of the word ""zup"" corresponds directly to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. 

- In the first input example (""dax zup lug""), ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" between ""green"" (dax) and ""blue"" (lug).
- In the second example (""dax lug zup""), ""zup"" again corresponds to ""yellow,"" this time at the end of the sequence.
- In the third example (""lug zup lug""), ""zup"" is in the middle and still corresponds to ""yellow,"" with ""blue"" before and after it.
- In the fourth example (""zup bluf""), ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and it is followed by another ""yellow"" (bluf).
- Finally, in the fifth example (""zup wif walm""), ""zup"" is the first word and corresponds to ""yellow,"" followed by three instances of ""red"" (""wif walm"" = ""red red red"").

Thus, ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" by looking for patterns. Here's a breakdown of each example:

1. ""dax lug bluf wif"" translates to ""green blue blue red""
2. ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue green green""
3. ""wif bluf lug zup"" translates to ""red red blue yellow""
4. ""wif dax bluf"" translates to ""red green green""
5. ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" translates to ""red yellow yellow red green""

Now let's analyze the patterns:

- In examples 1, 3, and 4 ""bluf"" appears to translate to ""green.""
- In example 2, ""bluf"" is the last word and translates to the second ""green"" in the sequence despite other colors appearing twice.
- In example 5, ""bluf"" occurs after ""zup"" (which translates to ""yellow"") and results in another ""yellow,"" as if replicating the color before it.

With these observations, we can infer that ""bluf"" could mean ""repeat the previous color"".

Rule: bluf -> repeat the previous color.
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" has a consistent pattern in its meaning. In every instance, the presence of ""walm"" after a color word results in the repetition of that color word's associated color in the output. Let's examine the examples more closely:

- In the first example, ""lug wif dax walm zup"" resulted in ""blue red green green green yellow."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and we observe ""green"" repeated twice immediately after.
  
- In the second and third examples, ""lug walm dax"" and ""lug walm"" yielded ""blue blue blue green"" and ""blue blue blue"" respectively. In both cases, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and we see repetitions of ""blue.""

- The fourth example is the same as the second one and the output does not change, which supports the consistent pattern.

- In the final example, ""lug dax walm wif"" became ""blue green green green red."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green,"" resulting in ""green"" being repeated twice.

Considering these observations, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the next color word's output color to repeat, starting immediately after its standard single occurrence. Since this repetition is affected by the presence of ""walm,"" the rule could be that when ""walm"" follows a color word, it causes a duplicate of the output color associated with that color word.

Rule: walm -> Causes the next color's output to be repeated.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup
    ",Output: red yellow,red yellow,True,97
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""lug"" can be deduced as follows:

lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Rule: dax -> green

Whenever the word 'dax' is present in the input, the word 'green' is present in the corresponding position in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" is a command to duplicate the color of the preceding word in the output. Here is the rule derived from each example to explain the outputs:

1. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
   Rule: The word ""wif"" after ""walm"" duplicates the color blue; the word ""wif"" after ""zup"" duplicates the color yellow.

2. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red
   Rule: The word ""wif"" after ""walm"" duplicates the color green.

3. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue
   Rule: When ""wif"" appears alone at the start, it defaults to the color red; ""lug"" is then blue.

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Rule: ""Wif"" after ""zup"" duplicates the color yellow, but since ""walm"" appears after ""wif"" and not another color, ""wif"" duplicates the default color red for both occurrences of ""wif.""

5. Input: wif
   Output: red
   Rule: When ""wif"" appears alone, it defaults to the color red.

Combining these observations:

wif -> meaning: ""wif"" duplicates the color of the word preceding it in the output. If ""wif"" appears first or if there is no preceding color word, it defaults to the color red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let us analyze the output patterns corresponding to each input where ""bluf"" appears:

1. ""dax bluf"" yields ""green green."" ""dax"" is consistently translated to ""green,"" so it seems that ""bluf"" is also translated to ""green.""

2. ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" yields ""yellow red green red red."" We already know ""dax"" is ""green,"" thus it would appear that ""bluf"" also translates to ""red"" here because it is directly followed by ""wif,"" which results in ""red.""

3. ""zup bluf dax lug"" yields ""yellow yellow green blue."" If ""bluf"" here means ""yellow,"" it might be taking the color of the word preceding it, which is ""zup,"" resulting in ""yellow.""

4. ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" yields ""green red green yellow yellow."" This suggests that ""bluf"" takes on the color ""yellow"" coming after ""zup.""

5. ""wif zup bluf lug"" yields ""red yellow yellow blue."" Here, ""bluf"" also translates to ""yellow,"" following the pattern identified in the third example where ""bluf"" matches the color of ""zup.""

From the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" follows a rule in which it takes on the color of the word that directly precedes it. There is an exception when ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" where it simply translates to ""green,"" or potentially it could mean the examples provided are insufficient to conclude a consistent rule for ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> translates to the color associated with the word directly preceding it, with a possible special rule when following ""dax"" where it might always be ""green.""
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the outputs in relation to where ""walm"" occurs in the input.

1. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
2. dax zup walm wif -> green yellow yellow yellow red
3. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
4. dax walm wif dax -> green green green red green
5. zup walm lug wif -> yellow yellow yellow blue red

Observing the patterns, when ""walm"" appears, the color immediately before ""walm"" is repeated for as many words follow ""walm"" until the next color word is encountered or the input ends.

Breaking it down:

- In example 1, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red red.""
- In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green green.""
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" until a new color word appears or the sequence ends.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup dax
    ",Output: green yellow green,green yellow green,True,98
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: When the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, we can infer that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Here is the deduction from the examples:

- In example 1, ""zup dax walm zup wif"" translates to ""yellow green green green yellow red."" ""Zup"" appears twice and translates to ""yellow"" both times, so it is consistent. ""Walm"" also appears twice and translates to ""green"" both times. The new word ""dax"" appears once and translates to ""green."" Because ""walm"" also means ""green,"" this suggests that either ""dax"" and ""walm"" both mean the same thing, or ""dax"" is influenced by its position. Since ""walm"" always translates to ""green,"" we can deduce that ""dax"" must also mean ""green.""
  
- In example 2, ""dax lug zup"" translates to ""green blue yellow."" We confirm that ""zup"" means ""yellow"" and ""lug"" means ""blue."" ""Dax"" is the first word and translates to ""green,"" consistent with our previous deduction.

- Examples 3 and 4 further confirm the meaning of ""lug"" as ""blue,"" as its position changes but its color translation does not. ""Dax"" is in different positions and maintains its color translation as ""green.""

- In example 5, ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow."" We see that ""wif"" means ""red,"" and ""zup"" means ""yellow."" Consistently, ""walm"" is ""red"" and ""dax"" is ""green"" regardless of position, strongly supporting that ""dax"" means ""green.""

Thus, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. There's no example where ""wif"" corresponds to any other color or set of colors. Therefore, we can induce the rule for ""wif"" as follows:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the color ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" correlates consistently with the color ""yellow"" in the output. Here's the evidence from the examples:

- ""zup walm wif"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" and since ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red,"" it would suggest that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
- ""lug bluf wif lug bluf zup"" yields ""blue blue red blue blue yellow,"" and by process of elimination and recognizing the other consistent translations, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""wif zup bluf"" yields ""red yellow yellow,"" and if ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and assuming that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" it supports the interpretation that ""zup"" also means ""yellow.""
- ""zup lug"" yields ""yellow blue,"" and if ""lug"" has consistently meant ""blue,"" this suggests ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
- ""dax bluf wif lug zup"" yields ""green green red blue yellow,"" and again we can deduce ""zup"" as ""yellow"" by recognizing the established patterns for the other words.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
From the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" by looking at patterns and their corresponding outputs.

In the first example:
Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
Output: blue red blue green green

Seeing ""lug"" and ""dax"" before ""bluf"" gives us an output of ""blue"" and ""green"" before two instances of ""green."" Since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" follows a ""green,"" the first occurrence of ""bluf"" might mean ""green.""

In the second example:
Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
Output: blue red red green blue blue

Here, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green."" However, the output of ""bluf"" here is ""red,"" which does not follow the previous pattern. Yet, in the same line, a second instance of ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"" which translates to ""blue,"" and accordingly, the second ""bluf"" then translates to ""blue"" as well. This is conflicting with the notion that ""bluf"" would mean ""green"" following our previous deduction.

In the third example:
Input: dax zup lug bluf
Output: green yellow blue blue

The ""bluf"" here follows ""lug"" which means ""blue,"" subsequently, ""bluf"" here is also interpreted as ""blue."" This aligns with one instance from the previous example.

In the fourth example:
Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
Output: blue green green yellow blue red

Here, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" which means ""green,"" and again ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""

In the fifth example:
Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
Output: green yellow red red blue

In this case, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" which has been shown to mean ""red,"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red.""

Considering the inconsistency in these results, one possible rule emerges. In situations where ""bluf"" is followed by a color word (""dax"" or ""lug""), ""bluf"" takes on the color meaning of that word. Whenever ""bluf"" is not followed by a color word, it seems to default to ""red."" However, this pattern is not fully consistent, so additional context or examples would likely be needed for a more accurate rule. Based on the examples provided:

Rule: ""bluf"" generally takes the color of the word that follows it, but defaults to ""red"" if not followed by a color word. This rule, however, does not account for all observations consistently.
Analyzing the provided examples, each time the word ""walm"" appears, a sequence of the color green is produced. It appears that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color that immediately precedes it in the Output sequence. Here's a breakdown of the examples:

- In the first example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to the color green. After ""walm,"" the color green is repeated multiple times.
- In the second example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" which has the corresponding color blue. After ""walm,"" the color yellow is produced instead, because ""zup"" appears before the next mention of ""walm.""
- In the third example, ""lug"" comes before the first ""walm,"" and ""zup"" comes before the second ""walm,"" producing a sequence of blue followed by a sequence of yellow, consistent with the colors associated with ""lug"" and ""zup,"" respectively.
- The fourth and fifth examples both have ""wif"" before ""walm,"" and the output is red repeated multiple times after ""walm,"" consistent with the color associated with ""wif.""

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm zup
    ",Output: blue blue yellow,blue blue blue yellow,False,99
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Every time the word ""lug"" is input, the output is ""blue.""
dax -> meaning. The word ""dax"" corresponds to the meaning of the color ""green"" either as a signal or stimuli within the given examples.

Rule:
""Dax"" maps to ""green"" in the output consistently across all given examples. Other colors seem to correspond to other words, as seen with ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue."" The position of the words does not affect what color they translate to; ""lug"" at different positions in the input strings still maps to ""blue"" in the output, indicating that each non-dax word independently represents a specific color regardless of sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" appears to have a consistent translation into the color ""red.""

In each instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. 

Here are the mappings from the inputs to the outputs that support this conclusion:

- ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red,"" with ""wif"" corresponding to the first ""red.""
- ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue,"" with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red.""
- ""lug dax lug wif"" translates to ""blue green blue red,"" with ""wif"" corresponding to the last ""red.""
- ""wif bluf lug"" translates to ""red red blue,"" with the first ""red"" corresponding to ""wif.""
- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" with the first ""red"" corresponding to ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> meaning: ""red""
zup -> yellow.

Rule: The word ""zup"" represents the color yellow.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. Here's the mapping from the inputs to the outputs:

1. ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" -> ""blue red blue green green"": ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""dax,"" which is green.
2. ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue"": ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""lug,"" which is blue.
3. ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow blue yellow yellow"": ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.
4. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"": ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""wif,"" which is red.
5. ""wif zup bluf"" -> ""red yellow yellow"": ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.

Rule: bluf -> The nonce word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately before it.
Observing the examples provided, the following patterns emerge:

- Each instance of ""walm"" correlates with a repeated color in the output, matching the color that directly precedes it.
- The number of repetitions of the color is equal to the number of times the color word (or its associated nonce word) appears in the input.

Here are the associations between input words and colors:

- ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green.""
- ""lug"" correlates with the color ""blue.""
- ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red.""
- ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow.""

With these associations, let's look at the examples:

1. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""green"" is repeated three times.
2. ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue"" - Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and ""blue"" is said three times since ""lug"" appears twice.
3. ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue blue red blue blue"" - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and we see ""blue"" repeated three times.
4. ""dax walm"" (repeated example) results in ""green green green"" - As with the first example, it reinforces the rule.
5. ""zup walm wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow red"" - Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

From these observations, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be: 

walm -> Repeat the color that directly precedes ""walm"" in the input, for the number of times that the color-word or its associated word appears in total within the input.

Rule: ""walm"" causes the preceding color word to be repeated in the output for as many times as the color word or its associated word appears in the full input string.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each given example, irrespective of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words.
Rule: dax -> green

The instances provided consistently associate the nonce word ""dax"" with the output ""green,"" suggesting that ""dax"" translates or represents the color green. There seems to be no other variation in outputs when ""dax"" is inputted, regardless of the surrounding words. The surrounding words (""zup,"" ""bluf,"" ""wif,"" ""walm"") have outputs that vary (yellow, green, red), but ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif."" Here's what we can elucidate from the given data:

- Every time ""wif"" appears alone or as the first word in a sequence, the color ""red"" is the first in the output sequence.
- Following ""wif"" with other words leads to different colors in the output that correspond to the words following ""wif.""

Let's break down each example:

- ""lug wif bluf"" produces ""blue red red."" ""wif"" here corresponds to the second ""red"" in the output.
- ""zup wif"" produces ""yellow red."" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""wif lug dax lug"" produces ""red blue green blue."" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" at the beginning of the sequence.
- ""wif"" alone produces ""red.""
- ""wif lug"" produces ""red blue."" ""wif"" corresponds to the first color ""red.""

Taking into account these observations, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" consistently.

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the examples provided.
bluf -> yellow

Rule: The word ""bluf"" represents the color yellow, but the number of times the color is repeated in the output is contingent on the position of ""bluf"" in the input sequence. Specifically, ""bluf"" is replaced with ""yellow"" repeated as many times as the positional index of ""bluf"" within the sequence, starting the count from 1. For instance, in the third input example, ""bluf"" is the second word, so the output is ""yellow"" repeated twice. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is the sixth word, so the output is ""yellow"" repeated six times. However, in the last case, there appears to be an inconsistency based on the previously observed pattern, because ""yellow"" is repeated five times instead of six. If we assume that ""bluf"" should map to ""yellow"" repeated six times (as based on the pattern from previous examples), then the fifth output appears to be in error, possibly due to a mistake in the input-output example provided. Otherwise, the pattern in regards to the position of ""bluf"" does not hold consistently.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" acts as an instruction to repeat the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before ""walm."" Here is how the rule applies in each example:

1. ""zup wif walm lug"" -> ""yellow red red red blue"":
   - ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red.""
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" thus ""red"" is repeated three times.
   - Finally, ""lug"" is associated with the color ""blue.""

2. ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red"":
   - ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red.""
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" thus ""red"" is repeated three times.
   - ""lug"" appears before ""wif"" and is associated with ""blue.""

3. ""zup lug walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue"":
   - ""lug"" is associated with the color ""blue.""
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" thus ""blue"" is repeated three times.

4. ""lug walm dax"" -> ""blue blue blue green"":
   - ""lug"" is associated with the color ""blue.""
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" thus ""blue"" is repeated twice more.
   - ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green.""

5. ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" -> ""green green green red blue green green green"":
   - ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green.""
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" thus ""green"" is repeated twice more.
   - ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red.""
   - ""lug"" is associated with the color ""blue.""
   - A second occurrence of ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" indicates that ""green"" should be repeated three more times.

So, we can establish the rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word before ""walm"" to be repeated three more times, adding to the inherent occurrence of the color for that word. 

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the previous word three additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,101
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: Each time the word ""lug"" appears, it translates to the color ""blue.""
Based on the limited information provided by the examples, it is possible to deduce that the nonce word ""dax"" is associated with the output ""green.""

In the first three examples, the input ""dax"" consistently leads to the output ""green."" In the fourth example, ""dax"" together with another nonce word ""walm"" continues with the ""green green green"" output, suggesting that ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" may also correspond to ""green.""

In the last input, more nonce words are added, and each seems to lead to a different color in the output. Without known meanings for ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""wif,"" and how they might potentially interact with ""dax"" to produce an output, we cannot establish a concrete rule for them. However, whenever ""dax"" appears in the sequence, the output is ""green.""

Thus, the rule appears to be:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in each example provided.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in each given example.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" correlates directly with color words in English. Observing the color that follows each time ""bluf"" is presented, we can discern the following pattern:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""green,"" but since ""lug"" is also followed by ""blue,"" ""bluf"" cannot simply mean ""green.""
2. In the second and the third examples, ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue.""
3. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is again followed by ""blue.""
4. In the fifth example, we find that ""bluf"" translated to ""red,"" but this is likely because each word is doubled, as ""zup"" leads to ""yellow yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red red,"" suggesting ""bluf"" should also double up, and thus it outputs ""red red.""

The consistency of ""bluf"" being associated with ""blue"" in the second, third, and fourth examples, irrespective of preceding words, suggests the correct rule. The fifth example is a pattern of duplication rather than a contradiction of the rule, so ""bluf"" followed by ""red red"" should likely be ""blue blue"" if not for the duplicating pattern present in that input.

Based on these observations, the rules appear to be:

1. ""Bluf"" translates directly to ""blue.""
2. When duplication occurs, all colors are duplicated in the output, even if ""bluf"" is part of the input.

Rule: bluf -> blue
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns associated with the word in the provided inputs and outputs:

1. In every output, the occurrence of ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the same color.
2. The color that repeats appears to be based on the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

Now let's take a closer look at each case:

- Input: zup dax walm zup wif
  Output: yellow green green green yellow red
  ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""green"" repeats.

- Input: dax lug walm
  Output: green blue blue blue
  ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and ""blue"" repeats.

- Input: zup wif walm lug
  Output: yellow red red red blue
  ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and ""red"" repeats.

- Input: zup bluf wif walm
  Output: yellow yellow red red red
  ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and ""red"" repeats.

- Input: zup walm lug wif
  Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
  ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and ""yellow"" repeats.

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" indicates the color immediately preceding it should be repeated three times. Therefore, we can deduce the following:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup walm dax wif lug
    ",Output: green yellow yellow yellow green red blue,green yellow yellow yellow green red blue,True,102
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. 

Rule: In each example, the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's look at its occurrence in the different inputs and the corresponding outputs:

1. ""dax zup lug wif lug"" corresponds to ""green yellow blue red blue""
2. ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green""
3. ""dax walm wif zup"" corresponds to ""green green green red yellow""
4. ""dax bluf wif"" corresponds to ""green green red""
5. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Given the consistent appearance of ""green"" every time the word ""dax"" appears, we can deduce that ""dax"" directly translates to ""green."" Additionally, observing that ""dax"" at the beginning of each sequence adds a ""green"" to the output, it appears that ""dax"" itself signifies ""green"" and may also prefix other sequences that provide additional context or meaning.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" and when it precedes other words, it introduces a sequence where each word is mapped to a specific color in the output.
From the given examples, we can infer that the word ""wif"" directly translates to the color red. However, it also seems to cause the following word to be repeated in the color sequence. Here's how the rule applies:

Examples:

1. dax walm wif walm -> green green green red red red
   ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""walm"" translates to ""green,"" and ""wif"" not only translates to ""red"" but also causes the subsequent ""walm"" to repeat twice.

2. wif lug -> red blue
   ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""lug"" stays as ""blue"" without repetition.

3. wif walm zup lug wif walm zup -> red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
   ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""walm"" is repeated as ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and the sequence repeats with the second occurrence of ""wif.""

4. dax zup wif bluf lug -> green yellow red red blue
   ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and it causes ""bluf"" to repeat as ""red,"" followed by ""lug"" as ""blue.""

5. wif lug -> red blue
   ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" without repetition.

Based on these observations, the rule is:

Rule: wif translates to red and causes the immediately following word to be repeated in its corresponding color sequence. (The repetition rule does not apply to ""lug"" in example 2 because there are no multiples of the color ""blue,"" which is represented by ""lug"" in the pattern).
From the examples provided, we can induce the following associations for each word:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue

It appears that each word in the input translates to a specific color in the output, and the colors are listed in the same order as the words. In all cases, zup corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the list.

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> the color word preceding ""bluf"" in the input, repeated. If the preceding word indicates a color, then ""bluf"" translates to that color repeated. If ""bluf"" is at the beginning with no preceding color word, it outputs ""yellow"" twice, as yellow is the default color when no other color is specified before ""bluf"".
Rule: walm -> red red red (repeat the color associated with the previous word three times) 

In each output, when the word ""walm"" appears, it results in the color associated with the preceding word being repeated three times. Here's the association based on the given examples:

1. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow (zup corresponds to yellow, and walm repeats it thrice)
2. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red (zup corresponds to yellow, walm repeats the color from the word right before it which is zup, thus yellow three times)
3. dax walm wif walm -> green green green red red red (dax corresponds to green, walm repeats it thrice, after wif, walm repeats red three times)
4. lug wif walm -> blue red red red (lug corresponds to blue, wif corresponds to red, walm repeats the most recent color which is red, three times)
5. dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue blue yellow red (after lug, which is blue, walm repeats blue three times)

So, walm is not a word with a fixed meaning or color association but instead a command that causes the output to repeat the color of the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup dax zup
    ",Output: red yellow green yellow,red yellow green yellow,True,103
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Every time the word 'lug' appears in the input, it translates to 'blue' in the output.
Based on the provided examples, we can observe that whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" appears at the corresponding position in the output. There are no exceptions to this rule in the given examples. Therefore, we can deduce that ""dax"" is associated with the color green.

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"", let's analyze the patterns in the examples:

1. When ""dax"" is present, the output is ""green.""
2. When ""lug"" is present, the output is ""blue.""
3. ""wif"" correlates with the output ""red,"" but it depends on the position and other words in the input.
4. The standalone input ""lug wif"" results in ""blue red,"" suggesting ""wif"" independently may result in ""red.""
5. The presence of ""bluf"" leads to ""red"" following the pattern of ""wif.""
6. The order of the words in the input impacts the order of the colors in the output.
7. ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow.""

Now, applying these observations, we can induce that ""wif"" consistently correlates with the output color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, regardless of its position or the surrounding words, the color ""red"" appears in the output. 

There are instances where multiple occurrences of the color red appear in the output, which align with the multiple occurrences of either ""wif"" or ""wif"" and ""bluf"" in the input. This suggests that ""wif"" may represent the color red or might be a rule that enforces the color red in the output. Additionally, ""wif"" doesn't seem to always produce additional reds in a chained fashion like ""wif walm dax zup"" doesn't lead to multiple reds for the repeated ""wif"". Therefore, the exact sequencing rule is not clear based on the given data. Still, there is a consistent association between ""wif"" and red.

Rule: ""wif"" correlates with the output color ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" In each instance, whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

Here's the matched data to support this rule:

- In ""lug zup,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""
- In ""wif zup dax bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" also to ""green.""
- In ""lug dax zup dax walm wif,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" also to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""
- In ""wif bluf zup bluf wif,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""
- In ""zup walm dax lug,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

So the rule is:

zup -> ""yellow""
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the examples provided and identify any patterns:

1. zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup -> yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
2. wif bluf lug -> red red blue
3. wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue
4. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
5. dax lug bluf dax -> green blue blue green

From the above examples, we can observe the following patterns:

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears after ""zup"", the output color is green (Example 1).
- When ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"", the output color is red (Examples 2 and 4).
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"", ""lug"", or no word, it results in blue (Examples 1, 2, 3, and 5).

Summarizing these observations, we can deduce the following rule for ""bluf"":

Rule:
bluf -> blue
However, the color preceding ""bluf"" is repeated. If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the output is red; if by ""zup,"" the output is yellow; and if by ""dax"" or ""lug,"" the output is green. If ""bluf"" does not have a preceding word that determines a color, its default color is blue.

Therefore, the rule can be refined as:

Rule:
bluf -> blue, but repeats the color of the preceding word if it determines a specific color (red for ""wif,"" yellow for ""zup,"" and green for ""dax"" or ""lug""). If there is no preceding color-determining word, ""bluf"" defaults to blue.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word three times, followed by the color corresponding to ""wif,"" which is red, if ""wif"" is present after ""walm.""

Let's break down the examples:

1. ""lug walm wif bluf"" translates into ""blue blue blue red red."" Here, ""lug"" must represent ""blue,"" ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""blue"" three times, and then ""wif"" seems to represent ""red"" and is repeated once more because it follows ""walm.""

2. ""zup walm wif"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow red."" In this instance, ""zup"" represents ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" triggers the threefold repetition of ""yellow."" ""Wif"" again constitutes ""red.""

3. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green."" Here, ""dax"" represents ""green,"" and ""walm"" leads to the thrice repetition of ""green."" There is no ""wif"" after ""walm,"" so no additional ""red"" is present.

4. ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green."" The order of elements here is important. ""Wif"" is ""red,"" followed by ""bluf,"" which doesn't appear to represent a color since it's not repeated ""blue,"" then ""dax"" for ""green,"" and finally ""walm,"" which repeats ""green"" three times. There's no ""red"" after ""walm"" since ""wif"" precedes ""dax,"" and ""walm"" only affects the word directly before it.

5. ""dax walm wif walm"" gives us ""green green green red red red."" ""Dax"" is ""green,"" ""walm"" repeats ""green"" thrice, ""wif"" is ""red,"" and the second ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times.

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times. If ""wif"" is present after ""walm,"" ""red"" is also repeated once for each instance of ""walm.""

Given the rules deduced, the meaning of ""walm"" can be stated as follows:

walm -> Repeat the preceding color three times. If followed by ""wif,"" add ""red"" for each ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the provided examples.
Based on the given examples, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"". It appears that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red"". Whenever ""dax"" is used, regardless of its position in the input, the output is ""green"". Therefore:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates directly to the color green regardless of its position or the context in which it appears.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following patterns and then establish a rule for what ""wif"" means:

1. When ""wif"" is paired with ""dax"" the Output is ""red green"":
   Input: wif dax
   Output: red green

2. When ""wif"" appears alone, the Output is ""red"":
   Input: wif
   Output: red

3. ""wif"" appears twice in the third example, both times followed by another color term. Each occurrence of ""wif"" leads to ""red"" in the output, followed by the color associated with the word that comes after ""wif"":
   Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow red green red red

4. ""wif"" appears after ""dax walm"" and before ""walm zup,"" where ""walm"" is repeated to result in ""green green"" for each instance and ""zup"" results in yellow at the end. ""wif"" still leads to ""red"":
   Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow

5. Finally, in the last example, ""wif"" appears after ""dax bluf"" and is not followed by anything, but it still results in ""red"":
   Input: dax bluf wif
   Output: green green red

From these examples, it seems that each word corresponds to a specific color output and ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" There's no indication that the meaning of ""wif"" changes based on position or context within the examples provided.

Rule: wif -> ""red""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" correlates to the color ""yellow."" Each instance where ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output. The other words present in the inputs correspond to their own respective colors in the outputs.

Here's how it works:

- ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red."" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""
- ""lug walm zup walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow."" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" gets repeated once in the input and is represented by a repetition of ""blue"" for each repetition. The last word ""zup"" is translated into ""yellow,"" and because ""walm"" precedes it, the ""yellow"" is repeated twice.
- ""zup lug"" translates to ""yellow blue,"" with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
- The fourth example is a repetition of the first, reinforcing the translations of ""zup"" to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""
- ""wif dax zup"" translates to ""red green yellow,"" with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponding to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule: ""bluf"" causes the output color to repeat the previous color mentioned. 

Deductions:
1. In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and when ""bluf"" is mentioned, the output is ""green green,"" indicating that ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""dax.""
2. In the second example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" followed by ""bluf,"" which results in ""yellow yellow."" After that, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" does not have a direct translation but does not seem to change the pattern, so the output continues as ""red red red.""
3. In the third and fifth examples, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and when ""bluf"" follows, the output is ""yellow yellow,"" repeating the color associated with ""zup.""
4. In the fourth example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and when ""bluf"" follows, ""red"" is repeated before moving onto ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue.""

Therefore, we can conclude:
bluf -> Causes repetition of the preceding color.
Based on the given examples, ""walm"" is associated with a repetition of the color that directly precedes it in a sequence. For instance, when ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which translates to ""green,"" the output is ""green green green."" Similarly, when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow."" There is no instance of ""walm"" leading a sequence, nor an instance where it is preceded by anything other than ""zup"" or ""dax"".

Given these observations, the rule appears to be:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color word that appears directly before it to be repeated three times in the output.

Hence, walm -> repeat the preceding color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Every instance where ""lug"" is mentioned, the output is ""blue.""
Rule: dax -> green.

The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in every example given. Each unique nonce word appears to correspond to a specific color: ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""walm"" to a repetition of ""blue,"" ""bluf"" to another ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to a repetition of ""yellow."" However, ""wif"" unequivocally means ""red"" regardless of its position in the input string.
Given the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" translates to a specific color output. Based on each instance where ""zup"" is used, it results in the word ""yellow"" in the output. Here is the breakdown:

- ""zup wif lug zup walm"" translates to ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"", with the two instances of ""zup"" producing ""yellow"" both times.
- ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"", with ""zup"" producing ""yellow"" once again.
- ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow"", with ""zup"" resulting in ""yellow"".
- ""zup lug"" translates to ""yellow blue"", with ""zup"" once more resulting in ""yellow"".
- ""dax lug zup"" translates to ""green blue yellow"", with ""zup"" again translating to ""yellow"".

From these examples, we can deduce:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to influence the repetition of the color word in the output following its mention. It's clear that ""bluf"" does not correspond to a single static word; rather, it indicates that whatever color is to follow should be repeated twice.

Here is the analysis based on provided examples:

1. ""wif walm lug bluf"" leads to ""red red red blue blue"". ""Bluf"" follows ""lug"", which corresponds to ""blue"", and ""blue"" is repeated twice in the output.

2. ""wif bluf"" produces just ""red red"". Here, ""bluf"" would pertain to ""wif"" which is ""red"", and ""red"" is repeated twice.

3. ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" results in ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"". Again, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""yellow"" is followed by a double.

4. ""zup lug bluf"" returns ""yellow blue blue"". Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which is ""blue"", and ""blue"" is doubled after its mention.

5. ""lug walm wif bluf"" turns into ""blue blue blue red red"". ""Bluf"" follows ""wif"", which is linked to ""red"", and in the output, ""red"" is repeated twice.

So the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Repeat the color that would have followed next in the sequence, twice.

If ""bluf"" were supposed to represent a color itself, it always comes before a word whose usual output is a color, and that color is then doubled. Therefore, ""bluf"" cannot directly represent a color in this context, but rather a rule to repeat the following color word.
Based on the provided input-output pairs, it seems that ""walm"" indicates repeating the color associated with the preceding word for a quantity of three times. Here's the breakdown of the examples:

- ""dax walm"" led to ""green green green,"" which indicates that ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" repeats it thrice.
- ""wif dax zup walm"" led to ""red green yellow yellow yellow,"" which indicates that ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. ""walm"" follows after ""zup"" and repeats yellow three times.
- ""lug walm wif lug"" led to ""blue blue blue red blue,"" which indicates that ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" repeats it thrice, whereas ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- ""zup walm"" led to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""walm"" repeats it thrice.
- ""dax walm zup lug dax"" led to ""green green green yellow blue green."" This shows ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""lug"" corresponds to blue. ""walm"" follows after ""dax"" and repeats green three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's look at the outputs corresponding to each input where ""dax"" is used:

1. ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" -> ""red green red red yellow red""
2. ""dax wif lug"" -> ""green red blue""
3. ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow""
4. ""dax lug zup dax"" -> ""green blue yellow green""
5. ""dax bluf zup"" -> ""green green yellow""

In each case where the term ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears at the corresponding position in the output. By contrasting the positions of ""dax"" with the outcomes, regardless of its location within the sequence or the surrounding words, the word ""green"" consistently follows ""dax.""

Rule:
dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following correlations:

- zup always corresponds to the output ""yellow""
- lug corresponds to ""blue""
- bluf corresponds to ""yellow"" (since ""zup"" also means yellow, it's likely that ""bluf"" simply reiterates the yellow color in this context or is a synonym)
- dax corresponds to ""green""

Therefore, the rule appears to be a straightforward translation from the nonce words to color names.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" consistently results in the same color output regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it. This consistency suggests that ""bluf"" directly translates to a particular color. In all cases where ""bluf"" is present, the output includes the word ""yellow.""

Here are the occurrences of ""bluf"" from the examples:

- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
- ""zup bluf wif"" -> ""yellow yellow red""
- ""wif bluf dax"" -> ""red red green""
- ""zup bluf dax"" -> ""yellow yellow green""

From these patterns, it is evident that the presence of ""bluf"" yields ""yellow"" in the output, no matter what other words are present. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

bluf -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" is translated to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns of input and output colors:

1. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red"" and is followed by more reds, potentially due to ""walm""

2. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   - ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - The three ""red"" in a row indicate that ""walm"" may be causing repetition of the color that precedes it

3. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and is followed by more greens, which supports the repetition idea tied to ""walm""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

4. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - The repetition of ""blue"" again supports the idea of ""walm"" repeating the preceding color

5. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" seems to cause ""yellow"" to repeat after ""zup""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and it seems ""bluf"" is a separate color command leading to another ""red""

According to these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color corresponding to the word just before it to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color word to be repeated three additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,107
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the meaning of ""lug"" can be deduced as follows:

1. ""lug zup"" -> ""blue yellow""
2. ""lug zup"" -> ""blue yellow""
3. ""dax walm lug"" -> ""green green green blue""
4. ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" -> ""blue red green green red blue""
5. ""lug dax walm wif"" -> ""blue green green green red""

In all these examples, the word ""lug"" is consistently translated to ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green. The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in every given example.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that each word corresponds to a specific color. The same output color appears each time a specific word is present in the input. Therefore, we can infer the following:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> blue

Given these consistent mappings, we can look at the outputs where ""wif"" appears and determine what color it corresponds to by process of elimination. In each example where ""wif"" is present, the color ""red"" is in the output. More specifically:

- Input: wif dax lug → Output: red green blue
- Input: zup bluf wif lug dax → Output: yellow yellow red blue green
- Input: zup wif → Output: yellow red
- Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug → Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
- Input: dax bluf wif zup → Output: green green red yellow

In each case, regardless of position or accompanying words, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it seems that 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow.' Each occurrence of the word 'zup' in the input results in 'yellow' in the output. Additionally, it looks like 'wif' corresponds to 'red,' 'walm' to 'yellow yellow yellow' (three yellow terms), 'lug' to 'blue,' and 'dax' to 'green.' 

Therefore, the rule for 'zup' is:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the provided examples, the word bluf corresponds to the repeated color of the word immediately preceding it in the sequence. In each case, the color that is associated with the word right before bluf is repeated after bluf in the output. For example:

- In the first example, dax corresponds to the color green, and when bluf is used after dax, the output is ""green yellow yellow,"" where ""green"" is repeated immediately after its first occurrence.
- In the second example, again, dax corresponds to green, and the output for ""lug dax bluf"" is ""blue green green,"" with ""green"" being repeated.
- In the third and fourth examples, lug and dax each have one corresponding color (""blue"" and ""green,"" respectively), and when bluf follows either, their colors are doubled in the output.
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""wif zup dax bluf"" outputs ""red yellow green green,"" indicating that the word dax, which is before bluf, corresponds to green, which is then doubled as per the rule.

Hence, the rule appears to be: bluf repeats the color of the word immediately before it in the output sequence.

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color associated with the preceding word in the output.
walm -> meaning. Rule:
Based on the given examples, the output for the word ""walm"" consistently results in a repeated sequence of a color. The number of times the color is repeated corresponds to the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence. The specific color that is repeated seems to depend on the word immediately preceding ""walm."" 

Here's the breakdown:
- In the first and second example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" with ""walm"" corresponding to three repetitions of ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""lug zup walm lug"" results in ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" with ""walm"" again corresponding to three repetitions of ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue,"" with ""walm"" corresponding to three repetitions of ""blue"" (since ""lug"" is before ""walm"").
- In the fifth example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" results in ""yellow yellow red red red,"" with ""walm"" corresponding to three repetitions of ""red"" (since ""wif"" is before ""walm"").

From this, we can deduce a rule:

Rule: ""walm"" repeated three times corresponds with the color associated with the word immediately preceding it in the sequence.

Possible colors associated with certain words:
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- wif -> red

So the rule for ""walm"" can be formulated as:
walm -> Three repetitions of the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"" in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,108
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" by looking at its corresponding output in each case. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""lug zup wif lug"" corresponds to ""blue yellow red blue."" Since ""lug"" appears twice and both times it translates to ""blue,"" we can assume that is its meaning.
- In the second example, ""wif lug dax walm"" corresponds to ""red blue green green green,"" where ""lug"" is again translated to ""blue.""
- The third example, ""dax lug zup,"" corresponds to ""green blue yellow,"" once again showing that ""lug"" is represented by ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug zup"" corresponds to ""blue yellow,"" further supporting the assumption that ""lug"" means ""blue.""
- Finally, the fifth example, ""zup dax lug,"" corresponds to ""yellow green blue,"" which once more indicates that ""lug"" means ""blue.""

From every example, we can clearly see that whenever the word ""lug"" is used, its corresponding output is ""blue."" Therefore, we can conclude the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" each time it is used.
Based on the examples provided, we can induce a rule linking the nonce word 'zup' to a specific meaning. Each instance of 'zup' corresponds to a specific color in the output. Looking at the examples:

- When 'zup' appears alone, the output is 'yellow.'
- When 'zup' is used in a sequence with another word 'lug,' which we can determine means 'blue,' the output is an alternating sequence of 'yellow' and 'blue.'
- When 'zup' follows 'wif lug,' with 'wif' corresponding to 'red' and 'lug' corresponding to 'blue,' the output correctly places 'yellow' after 'red blue.'
- When 'zup' is bookended by 'lug,' the word for 'blue,' the colors still alternate correctly.
- When 'zup' precedes 'wif' meaning 'red' and 'dax walm' which appears to correspond to 'green green green,' the output starts with 'yellow' and correctly follows the pattern with the other colors.

Therefore, the nonce word 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow.'

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" correlates to the color ""blue."" However, the rule seems to be affected by the preceding word; bluf outputs a color different from the word immediately before it. Here are the observations:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red), the output is ""green.""
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (blue), the output is ""blue.""
3. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (green), the output is ""green.""
4. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), the output is ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" outputs the color of the preceding word. If there is a pattern of ""wif bluf"" (red green), this can be considered an exception to the rule.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the word immediately before it, with ""wif bluf"" being a specific exception that outputs ""red green.""
To deduce the rule of ""walm,"" we observe the output associated with each input containing the word ""walm"" and identify any patterns or rules accordingly. Here's the analysis:

1. ""dax walm zup walm"" results in ""green green green yellow yellow yellow."" We notice that ""dax"" precedes three greens and ""zup"" three yellows. ""Walm"" comes before a transition from green to yellow, which are both colors.

2. ""wif lug walm"" results in ""red blue blue blue."" Here, ""wif"" results in red, and ""lug"" in blue, while ""walm"" is followed by three blues.

3. ""zup walm dax"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow green."" In this case, ""zup"" starts with three yellows, and ""dax"" ends with green. ""Walm"" is followed by a color change from yellow to green.

4. ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" results in ""blue blue red blue red red red blue."" ""Lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" to red, and ""bluf"" does not change the color. After ""walm,"" we see a switch from red to blue.

5. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" results in ""red red green green red red red blue red."" Here again, ""walm"" is followed by a color change from red to blue.

From the patterns observed, it seems that ""walm"" is associated with a change in color in the output sequence. It does not produce a color itself but affects the color that follows it, potentially indicating a change from one color sequence to another. However, the color that follows ""walm"" isn't fully consistent in the given examples.

Rule: walm -> causes a change in the color sequence to another color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow blue,yellow yellow yellow blue,True,109
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To determine the meaning of ""lug,"" I will analyze each corresponding output for the word ""lug"":

- ""wif dax lug dax"" corresponds to ""red green blue green""
  ""lug"" here corresponds to ""blue"" as it's the new word in the sequence.

- ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" corresponds to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue""
  The first ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" again, and the second ""lug"" also corresponds to ""blue"" consistent with the previous example. 

- ""lug zup"" corresponds to ""blue yellow""
  ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" once more.

- ""wif lug wif"" corresponds to ""red blue red""
  ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" again.

- ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" corresponds to ""blue green yellow green green green red""
  The first ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Based on these examples, each time ""lug"" is used, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. Therefore, the rule seems to be consistent across all examples.

Rule: lug -> blue.
Observing the given examples and their corresponding outputs, we can attempt to derive the meaning or pattern of the word ""dax."" Here's the mapping from the input to the output in each provided example:

1. ""zup bluf dax"" -> ""yellow yellow green""
2. ""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green""
3. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
4. ""zup dax lug"" -> ""yellow green blue""
5. ""zup lug dax"" -> ""yellow blue green""

As ""dax"" appears in different positions in the input and corresponds to ""green"" in the output every time, we can deduce:

dax -> green

Rule: Regardless of its position in the input string, ""dax"" always corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
Based on the given examples where ""zup"" is present, it appears that the word ""zup"" is consistently translated as ""yellow"". The other words each correspond to a different color: ""walm"" translates to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, ""dax"" to green, and ""wif bluf"" to double red. However, the presence of ""zup"" does not appear to modify the translation of the other words surrounding it; it is consistently translated independently to ""yellow"".

Rule:
zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, we can try to identify a pattern for the word ""bluf"". Let's analyze:

1. wif bluf dax -> red red green
2. lug bluf wif -> blue blue red
3. lug bluf -> blue blue
4. wif bluf -> red red
5. zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue

It appears that the output for ""bluf"" directly repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the third and fourth examples, we see the same patterns as the first two examples with ""lug"" leading to ""blue"" and ""wif"" leading to ""red.""
- The fifth example shows ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow."" However, the word ""bluf"" comes after ""lug,"" which correlates to ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" results in the repetition of ""blue.""

So the rule we can derive is:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word immediately before it.

Therefore:

bluf -> the color of the word before it.
walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word. Rule: For each occurrence of the word preceding ""walm,"" its corresponding color is repeated three times. For instance:

- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to blue.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,110
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: 
The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of the context it is used in. The other words in the examples (""wif,"" ""walm,"" ""dax"") correspond to different colors (""wif"" to ""red,"" ""walm"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green"").
To determine the meaning of ""dax"", let us examine the provided examples looking for a pattern:

1. Whenever ""lug"" is input, the output is ""blue"".
2. Whenever ""zup"" is input, the output is ""yellow"".
3. Whenever ""walm"" is input, it seems to elongate the previous color mentioned in the output, as seen in ""walm"" following ""lug"" or ""dax"".

We can now analyze the instances of ""dax"":

- In the first example, ""lug dax zup"" turns into ""blue green yellow."" With ""lug"" confirmed as ""blue"" and ""zup"" as ""yellow"", ""dax"", occurring between them, translates to green.
- In the second example, ""dax lug walm"" becomes ""green blue blue blue."" Knowing that ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""walm"" repeats the color ""blue"", ""dax"" must be ""green"".
- In the third example, ""zup dax lug zup"" corresponds to ""yellow green blue yellow."" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" appears as ""green"" again.
- In the fourth example, ""dax zup"" becomes ""green yellow."" With ""zup"" known as ""yellow,"" this also suggests ""dax"" is ""green"".
- In the fifth example, ""zup wif dax walm"" becomes ""yellow red green green green."" The new word ""wif"" is thereby translated as ""red,"" given that ""zup"" is yellow and ""dax"" is followed by a string of ""green,"" with ""walm"" amplifying the preceding color.

By looking at the placement and the resulting outputs in all instances, the following can be deduced:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" is produced in the output. This is consistent across all examples provided, regardless of the context or the surrounding words. Therefore, the rule I can deduce is as follows:

Rule: wif -> red

This means that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
Based on the examples given, it appears that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. Whenever ""zup"" is present in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output at the same position. Here's the breakdown of each example:

1. Input: zup lug
   Output: yellow blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" corresponds to blue.

2. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""walm"" is followed by yellow and corresponds to yellow, ""dax"" is followed by ""zup"" but corresponds to green, and ""wif"" corresponds to red.

3. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" corresponds to red.

4. Input: zup wif (repeated example)
   Output: yellow red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" corresponds to red. This repetition confirms the consistency.

5. Input: lug walm zup
   Output: blue blue blue yellow
   - ""lug"" and ""walm"" correspond to blue, and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.

So, based on these examples, the rule appears to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> meaning. Meaning can be the repetition of the color denoted by the previous word in the sequence.

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" follows a color-denoting word, it signifies that the color should be repeated. For example, in the input ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, so ""bluf"" results in the color red being repeated, thus the output is ""red red.""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" triggers repetition of the color associated with the word that directly precedes it three times. Here is the rule deduced from the given examples:

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" appears after another word, the color corresponding to that previous word is repeated three times.

Using this rule, let's verify with each example:

1. Input: ""zup lug walm""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" after ""lug"" gives ""blue blue blue""
   Output: ""yellow blue blue blue""

2. Input: ""dax walm""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""walm"" after ""dax"" gives ""green green green""
   Output: ""green green green""

3. Input: ""dax zup walm wif walm""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" after ""zup"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" after ""wif"" gives ""red red red""
   Output: ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red""

4. Input: ""zup dax lug walm zup lug""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" after ""lug"" gives ""blue blue blue""
   - ""zup"" again corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue""
   Output: ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue""

5. Input: ""wif walm dax""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" after ""wif"" gives ""red red red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   Output: ""red red red green""

Summary: 
walm -> The preceding word's color is repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems like ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"". Each time the nonce word ""lug"" is used in the input, the corresponding word in the output is ""blue"". 

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence. When other color-indicating nonce words (such as ""wif"" for red and ""lug"" for blue) are present in the input, they are translated to their respective colors, and ""dax"" remains constant as green.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by looking for patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Looking at the first and fourth examples where the input is simply ""wif"", the output is ""red"" for both. This suggests that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" when it appears alone.

However, in contexts with other words, ""wif"" still translates to ""red"", but the other words translate to different colors:

- In the second example, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" to ""green"".
- In the third example, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" seems to duplicate the previous color based on ""walm wif"" resulting in ""green green red"".
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" translates to ""green"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""walm"" again duplicates the previous color, as ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"".

From this, we can deduce that ""wif"" is consistently translated to the color ""red"", regardless of context.

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look at the patterns associated with other words first:

- ""wif"" always results in ""red.""
- ""dax"" always results in ""green.""
- ""lug"" always results in ""blue.""
- ""walm"" always results in ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" always results in ""yellow.""

Now, let's analyze the appearance of ""zup"" in the examples:

1. ""wif zup dax"" -> ""red yellow green""
2. ""zup walm dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green blue""
3. ""lug zup dax wif zup"" -> ""blue yellow green red yellow""
4. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
5. ""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red""

In every instance where ""zup"" appears, it translates to ""yellow,"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence. Based on this consistent pattern, we can deduce:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we should look for a pattern in each example that could explain its associated output:

1. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   
2. Input: lug wif lug bluf
   Output: blue red blue blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue""
   
3. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""
   
4. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   - This example is the same as the first one.
   
5. Input: lug bluf zup lug
   Output: blue blue yellow blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Based on the provided data, it appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it. When it is the first word (no word before it), it takes on the color of the word that follows it, which can be seen in examples 1 and 4 where ""bluf"" is the last word and follows ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word. If there is no preceding word, it takes the color of the following word.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the corresponding outputs for each given input where ""walm"" is present:

1. Input: ""zup walm"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
   - Here, ""walm"" corresponds to two ""yellow"" after ""zup.""

2. Input: ""dax lug wif walm"" -> Output: ""green blue red red red""
   - Here, ""walm"" corresponds to three ""red"" after ""wif.""
   
3. Input: ""zup lug walm wif walm"" -> Output: ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""
   - In this case, ""walm"" initially corresponds to three ""blue"" after ""lug,"" and then to three ""red"" after ""wif.""

4. Input: ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" -> Output: ""blue green yellow green green green red""
   - Here, ""walm"" corresponds to three ""green"" after ""dax.""
   
5. Input: ""wif walm dax zup"" -> Output: ""red red red green yellow""
   - In this example, ""walm"" is followed by two additional colors not directly associated with the words preceding ""walm.""

From the above examples, it appears that ""walm"" reproduces the color corresponding to the word right before it, three times. It does this for each instance of the word preceding ""walm."" Hence:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the preceding word three times. If ""walm"" is the first word, it repeats the color ""red"" specific to ""wif,"" potentially due to ""wif"" being the closest preceding word with a defined color. However, because we have only one example where ""walm"" is the first word, this part of the rule is an assumption based on limited data.

Therefore:
walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

In each example, whenever the word ""lug"" is present, the color ""blue"" appears once in the output sequence, and it doesn't seem to be affected by the position of ""lug"" within the input sequence. Here are the mappings from the examples given:

- dax lug -> green blue
- zup lug -> yellow blue
- wif lug -> red blue
- lug wif -> blue red
- lug -> blue

Thus, ""lug"" consistently maps to the color ""blue"" in each output.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the output color ""green."" Every time ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, ""green"" is included in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present. Here is the correlation found in the examples:

- Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow (dax corresponds to the third 'red' changing to 'green')
- Input: dax -> Output: green (dax is the only element and translates directly to 'green')
- Input: dax -> Output: green (dax is the only element and translates directly to 'green')
- Input: wif zup dax bluf -> Output: red yellow green green (dax corresponds to the third 'yellow' changing to 'green')
- Input: dax walm zup lug walm -> Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue (dax corresponds to the first 'green')

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the outputs correlating to each input, it appears that each word translates to a specific color. The word 'wif' consistently translates to 'red,' regardless of its position in the sequence of words. Each other word also appears to correlate with a specific color: 'zup' with 'yellow,' 'dax' with 'green,' 'lug' with 'blue,' and 'bluf' likely corresponds with 'yellow,' much like 'zup.'

Rule: 'wif' means 'red'.
zup -> yellow

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in each instance where it is used. Whenever zup appears in the input, it is replaced with yellow in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the meaning of ""bluf"" seems to change depending on the word that precedes it. The word before ""bluf"" dictates the color output of ""bluf."" Given the provided examples:

- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green.""

Based on this pattern, ""bluf"" appears to take on the color associated with the word that comes directly before it in the input. This implies that ""bluf"" is a placeholder for duplication of the color linked to the immediately preceding word. When there is a sequence, ""bluf"" repeats the pattern of colors based on their preceding words in the order they are given.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.
Reviewing the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" has the repeated effect of duplicating the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. Here is what we can deduce from the examples:

In the first example, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and when ""walm"" follows, it continues to produce the color yellow until a new color word is introduced:

- ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" turns into ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red.""

In the second example:

- ""zup walm wif"" turns into ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" which follows the same rule—'walm' continues the previous color (yellow) until ""wif"" introduces a new color (red).

In the third and fourth examples:

- The output ""dax walm"" turning into ""green green green"" suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" replicates that color.

Finally, in the fifth example:

- ""lug wif walm"" produces ""blue red red red,"" indicating that ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) and continues with red, suggesting that ""walm"" expresses replication of the preceding color.

Therefore, the rule for “walm” seems to be that it replicates the color corresponding to the word that precedes it, effectively extending the sequence of that color until another color word is mentioned.

Rule: walm -> replicates the previous color word's corresponding color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word 'lug' translates to the color 'blue' in each provided example.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we will compare the inputs and their corresponding outputs, looking for patterns that help define the word ""dax.""

1. In the first input, ""wif dax zup,"" the word ""dax"" is surrounded by two colors in the output: ""wif"" is translated as ""red"" and ""zup"" is translated as ""yellow."" The output for ""dax"" in this context is ""green.""

2. In the second input, ""zup dax lug dax,"" we see ""dax"" twice, and each time it corresponds to ""green"" in the output sequence, occurring after ""zup -> yellow"" and ""lug -> blue.""

3. The third input, ""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax,"" shows ""dax"" at the end of the sequence following two instances of ""bluf."" Since ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and we see that ""bluf"" doesn't seem to change the color output, it appears that ""bluf"" might be a repeat command. The ""dax"" follows ""yellow"" here and is once again ""green.""

4. In the fourth input, ""zup dax bluf,"" we have the ""dax"" positioned after ""zup,"" translating to ""yellow green,"" followed by ""bluf,"" which we suspect is a repeater since the output is ""green"" again.

5. Finally, the fifth input, ""lug dax zup dax walm wif,"" provides us with another sequence where ""dax"" is surrounded by known translations, with the added ""walm"" before ""wif,"" and the output for both ""walm"" and ""wif"" is ""green."" This might suggest ""walm"" has no impact on the output color, or it could possibly be synonymous with ""dax.""

Combining these observations, the rule for the translation of ""dax"" seems to be:

Rule: When ""dax"" occurs, it translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

So, dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color red in the outputs provided.
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following rules:

- ""zup"" by itself translates to ""yellow."" 
- When ""zup"" is preceded by another word, the output contains ""yellow"" in the last position, with preceding colors possibly depending on the preceding words.
- The words before ""zup"" seem to determine the other colors in the sequence:
  - ""dax"" before ""zup"" results in ""green"" appearing before the final ""yellow"".
  - ""walm"" with ""dax"" before ""zup"" results in ""green green green"" before the final ""yellow"".
  - ""lug"" after ""zup"" results in ""blue"" being added after ""yellow.""

However, with the given examples, the rules for the colors preceding ""yellow"" when ""zup"" is not by itself are not entirely clear due to a limited dataset (e.g., it is not clear what ""lug"" would do if it were to precede ""zup"" rather than follow it).

From the dataset provided, the most consistent and clear rule is:
Rule: zup -> yellow when standalone or as the last color described when preceded by other words.
From the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to a color. To deduce what ""bluf"" means, let's look at the corresponding colors in the outputs for each input where ""bluf"" is present:

1. Input: ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" corresponds to Output: ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow"". Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"", but since there are other instances of ""yellow"" corresponding to ""zup"", we cannot conclude that ""bluf"" means ""yellow"" alone.

2. Input: ""zup bluf lug dax lug"" corresponds to Output: ""yellow yellow blue green blue"". Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

3. Input: ""zup dax bluf"" corresponds to Output: ""yellow green green"". Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"".

4. Input: ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" corresponds to Output: ""blue red red green blue blue"". Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" then later to ""blue"".

5. Input: ""wif bluf"" corresponds to Output: ""red red"". Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".

Taking all the examples into consideration, it seems that ""bluf"" does not correspond consistently to a single color. Instead, ""bluf"" appears to mirror the color of the word that immediately precedes it, suggesting that ""bluf"" represents the concept of repetition or duplication of the previous element.

Rule: bluf -> bluf represents the repetition of the color word immediately preceding it.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look closely at its usage in the given examples and the corresponding outputs.

- In the first example, ""zup walm wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow red."" Since ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" we can assume ""walm"" translates to ""yellow"" as well, since it's repeated in the output.

- In the second example, ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" becomes ""green green green red blue green green green."" Here, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""wif"" again translates to ""red,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" Since ""walm"" appears twice, and ""green"" immediately follows both times, it's reasonable to assume that ""walm"" still translates to ""green.""

- In the third example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green."" Again, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""walm"" appears to maintain the translation of ""green.""

- The fourth example, ""zup bluf wif walm,"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red."" Since ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" ""wif"" means ""red,"" and ""bluf"" is a new word yet ""red"" follows it, which might imply ""bluf"" also means ""red."" Meanwhile, ""walm"" is followed by two additional ""red"" words, which is consistent with ""bluf"" seemingly intensifying the color red.

- The fifth example, ""zup walm dax zup dax wif,"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red."" Here, each ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" each ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" as seen before. The presence of ""walm"" results in an additional ""green"" following the pattern started by the preceding ""dax.""

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" is a color intensifier or duplicator, causing the preceding color word to be repeated in the output one additional time. Whenever ""walm"" appears after a color word in the input, that color word is translated into its corresponding color twice in the output.

Rule: ""walm"" causes the preceding color word's output to be repeated once.

Walm -> meaning: A repetition intensifier for the immediately preceding color word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" is used to represent the color blue. Irrespective of its position in the input sequence, it consistently translates to ""blue"" in the output. Therefore, the meaning of ""lug"" can be determined as:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in every example provided.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each word corresponds to a specific color, as follows:

- dax -> green
- bluf -> red
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> red

Thus, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" we should look at each example and identify the pattern regarding the presence of ""zup"" and the colors in the output.

In the first input-output pair:
dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

The word ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" and the pattern for ""walm"" seems to be a triplet of the same color; however, ""blue"" appears just before the triple ""yellow."" Since there is only one ""zup"" and only one ""blue,"" it's likely that ""zup"" corresponds to ""blue.""

In the second input-output pair:
zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow

The occurrence of ""zup"" again leads to a triplet, but ""zup"" by itself does not provide us with a clear indication of a single color. Yet, from the first example, we could guess that ""zup"" by itself could still represent ""blue.""

In the third input-output pair:
dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> green blue yellow red red green

Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" It's important to note that the word ""lug"" precedes ""zup"" and is paired with ""blue.""

In the fourth input-output pair:
zup wif walm -> yellow red red red

Once again, the ""zup"" is preceding the color ""yellow."" 

In the fifth input-output pair:
dax zup dax zup wif -> green yellow green yellow red

The word ""zup"" is consistently preceded by ""dax,"" and each ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" When ""dax"" appears, it's green, when ""zup"" appears, it's yellow.

Putting all these observations together, the resulting pattern can be summarized in the following rule:

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.

Therefore:

zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at the pattern of inputs and their corresponding outputs.

- When ""bluf"" is paired with ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue.""
- ""Bluf"" on its own appears to generate the output ""green green.""
- When ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"" and ""zup,"" and followed by either ""wif"" or ""lug,"" the output for ""bluf"" is consistently ""blue.""
- The output of other words such as ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax"" appear to correlate to specific colors: ""wif"" -> red, ""zup"" -> yellow, ""lug"" -> blue, ""dax"" -> green.

Using these patterns, we can hypothesize the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" likely represents the color ""blue"" as its output is consistently ""blue"" when it follows other nonce words related to colors. The exception is when it is unpaired or only with ""dax,"" it seems to duplicate the color of the preceding word (""dax"" in this example, giving ""green green""). Therefore, when ""bluf"" stands with or follows certain words, it adopts the characteristic color of those words. 

Based on the given examples, the rule for ""bluf"" might be:

bluf -> meaning: When ""bluf"" follows a color-associated nonce word, it reflects the color attributed to that word as ""blue."" When on its own or with ""dax,"" it reflects the color of ""dax,"" which is green, twice.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the output color corresponding to the word immediately before it. Specifically, the number of times the color is repeated seems to be three, regardless of which color it is associated with.

Let's verify this with each given example:

Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
Here, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to ""yellow,"" so after ""zup,"" there are three ""yellow"" in the output.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
Here, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to ""blue,"" and we see three ""blue"" in the output.

Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
Here, ""wif"" precedes the first ""walm"" and ""zup"" precedes the second ""walm."" The output is three ""red"" after the first ""wif"" and three ""yellow"" after the second ""zup.""

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" which is repeated three times in the output after ""zup.""

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
Here, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to ""red,"" which is then repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,115
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color blue in each instance it appears.
Rule: dax -> green

The examples show that whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output always contains the color ""green"" at the corresponding position. Thus, the rule deduced is that ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"".
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. Each time ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. Here are the examples again, with an explanation for each one:

- Input: wif bluf
  Output: red red
  ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" has also been associated with red (as seen in the third example).

- Input: zup wif
  Output: yellow red
  ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""wif"" corresponds to red.

- Input: lug bluf wif
  Output: blue blue red
  ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""bluf"" corresponds to blue (consistent with the first example when isolated with ""wif""), and ""wif"" corresponds to red.

- Input: zup wif walm
  Output: yellow red red red
  ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" seems to correspond to a triplication of the preceding color, hence three times red.

- Input: wif zup dax bluf
  Output: red yellow green green
  ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""zup"" to yellow, ""dax"" to green, and ""bluf"" now is associated with green as well, which seems contradictory given the previous examples unless ""dax"" has the effect of changing the following color to green.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" translates to the color red, but keep in mind that the meaning of ""bluf"" seems somewhat inconsistent, and the behavior of ""dax"" may have a modifying effect on the color represented by the following word.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green,"" and the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" Similarly, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue."" The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow"" no matter the context it is in.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, ""bluf"" reflects the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here's the analysis:

1. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"": ""bluf"" takes the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.
2. ""wif lug bluf"" -> ""red blue blue"": ""bluf"" takes the color of ""lug,"" which is blue.
3. ""lug bluf zup lug"" -> ""blue blue yellow blue"": Here, ""bluf"" occurs after ""lug"" and so takes its color, blue.
4. ""dax bluf zup"" -> ""green green yellow"": ""bluf"" takes the color of ""dax,"" which is green.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the word before it.
Observing the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" is associated with repeating the color of the word that precedes it three more times. Here is the analysis that supports this:

1. In the first example, ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" Here ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" seems to repeat ""blue"" three more times.

2. In the second example, ""lug walm zup"" leads to ""blue blue blue yellow."" After ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" ""walm"" again repeats ""blue"" three times.

3. The third example, ""lug wif walm,"" becomes ""blue red red red."" The word before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""red"" thrice.

4. In the fourth input, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" the output is ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" The occurrence of ""walm"" after a ""zup"" results in three additional ""yellow."" 

5. The fifth input, ""wif walm zup lug zup walm,"" results in ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and ""zup,"" creating three more ""reds"" and later three more ""yellows,"" respectively.

Taking these observations into account, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeats the color associated with the preceding word three more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif
    ",Output: green red,green red,True,116
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, we can try to determine the meaning or the rule for ""dax."" To do this, I'll examine each input where ""dax"" appears and the corresponding output.

1. dax lug -> green blue
2. zup walm lug zup wif dax -> yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
3. dax wif -> green red
4. lug wif dax wif -> blue red green red
5. lug dax -> blue green

From these examples, we can see the following:

- When ""dax"" appears before ""lug"" the output is ""green"" before ""blue"" (Examples 1 and 5).
- When ""dax"" appears after ""wif"", the output is ""green"" after ""red"" (Examples 3 and 4).
- In the mixed sequence (Example 2), ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", just like in previous examples with simpler sequences.

It is consistent across examples that the presence of ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in the output. There is no evidence of it being context-dependent.

Rule: dax -> green. ""Dax"" consistently means the color green, regardless of its position or surrounding words.
Rule: wif -> red

From the examples given, every occurrence of the word ""wif"" directly corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Regardless of its position in the input sequence, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, we can see a pattern emerging where each input word (nonce word or otherwise) corresponds to a color in the output. Each instance of the same input word is associated with the same color in the output. Therefore, we can induce the following associations:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Given that these associations are consistent across all examples, we can deduce the rule for the nonce word ""zup"":

zup -> yellow

Rule: Each unique word maps to a specific color in the output sequence. The word ""zup"" consistently maps to the color ""yellow.""
bluf -> red
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we'll look for patterns in each input-output pair. Consider the colors produced by each word in the input and how they change when ""walm"" is introduced.

1. ""dax"" individually generates ""green""
2. ""zup"" individually generates ""yellow""
3. ""lug"" individually generates ""blue""
4. ""wif"" individually generates ""red""
5. ""bluf"" individually generates ""red""

Now, let's analyze ""walm"" in this context.

- In the first example, after ""dax zup dax walm,"" the output is ""green yellow green green green."" Here, ""walm"" changes the output from possibly replicating the colors of the previous words to all ""green."" It seems to mimic and extend the color of ""dax.""

- In the second example, ""lug walm wif bluf"" gives ""blue blue blue red red."" After ""lug,"" which produces ""blue,"" the word ""walm"" results in a repetition of ""blue,"" and then the pattern continues with ""wif"" and ""bluf,"" each producing ""red.""

- In the third example, ""dax wif walm"" results in ""green red red red."" After ""wif"" which is ""red,"" ""walm"" seems to again repeat and extend the color ""red.""

- In the fourth example, ""dax lug wif walm"" translates to ""green blue red red red,"" which seems to imply that ""walm"" again repeats and extends the prior color, which is ""red.""

- In the fifth example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue."" So ""walm"" after ""lug"" extends the ""blue"" color.

From these examples, we can induce that ""walm"" repeats and extends the color of the last word mentioned before it. Considering this information, the rule can be summarized as:

Rule: walm -> Extend the color produced by the prior word to three instances.

So if ""walm"" follows a word that outputs ""green,"" it results in ""green green green."" If it follows a word that outputs ""red,"" it results in ""red red red,"" and so on.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup walm dax lug zup
    ",Output: blue yellow yellow yellow green blue yellow,blue yellow yellow yellow green blue yellow,True,117
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the output.
Analyzing the provided examples, the word ""dax"" appears to always correspond to the color ""green"" in the output. Let's validate this observation:

Example 1: wif walm dax zup | red red red green yellow
Here, ""dax"" corresponds to green.

Example 2: dax walm zup lug | green green green yellow blue
""dax"" is the first word and corresponds to the first output color, green.

Example 3: wif lug dax | red blue green
""dax"" is the last word and corresponds to the last output color, green.

Example 4: wif dax | red green
Again, ""dax"" corresponds to green.

Example 5: dax walm zup lug dax | green green green yellow blue green
""dax"" appears twice and both times it corresponds to green.

Based on this consistent pattern across all examples, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" appears to correspond to the color ""red."" Each time the word ""wif"" is present in the input, the color ""red"" is present in the output at the corresponding position. The rule is consistent across all given examples.

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns in each output relative to its input. Here's what we can deduce from the provided examples:

1. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
   
2. Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf -> Output: blue red red green blue blue

3. Input: wif zup bluf lug -> Output: red yellow yellow blue

4. Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow

5. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Given these inputs and outputs, let's see if we can identify a pattern:

In examples 1 and 4, ""bluf"" appears after a word, and the output is the color corresponding to that word, repeated twice.

- In example 1, ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and when ""bluf"" follows, the output is ""red red.""
- In example 4, ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and with ""bluf"" following, it results in ""yellow yellow.""

In example 2, ""bluf"" appears twice, and both times it is preceded by different words (""wif"" and ""lug""). The color given for ""bluf"" is the repetition of the color that corresponds to the preceding word:

- After ""wif"" (red), ""bluf"" leads to ""red red.""
- After ""lug"" (blue), ""bluf"" leads to ""blue blue.""

In examples 3 and 5, there is ""wif zup bluf lug"" and ""wif bluf"" within another sequence, leading again to red being doubled and blue being doubled when ""bluf"" follows ""lug.""

From this, it seems that ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the output color of the word that immediately precedes it. If no word precedes ""bluf"", then no color is outputted.

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word. If there is no preceding word, there is no associated color to repeat.
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

Rule:
- Whenever ""walm"" is present, it takes the color of the word that follows it in the sequence. If ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence, then it takes the color of the last word before it that has a defined color.

Let's analyze the examples given using this rule:

1. ""dax walm zup lug"" results in ""green green green yellow blue""
   - ""dax"" is green, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" so it takes the color of ""zup"", which is yellow.
   - ""lug"" is independent and blue.

2. ""dax walm zup walm"" results in ""green green green yellow yellow yellow""
   - Again, ""dax"" is green, first ""walm"" takes the color of ""zup"" after it, which is yellow.
   - The second ""walm"" takes the color of the last defined color before it, which is ""zup"" (yellow).

3. ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" results in ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue""
   - ""wif"" is red, the first ""walm"" takes the color of ""dax"" after it, which is green.
   - ""wif"" and ""lug"" are red and blue respectively.
   - The last ""walm"" takes the color of the last defined color before it, which is ""lug"" (blue).

4. ""zup walm dax"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow green""
   - ""zup"" is yellow, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" so it takes the color of ""dax"", which is green.

5. ""dax wif walm lug zup"" results in ""green red red red blue yellow""
   - ""dax"" is green, ""wif"" is red.
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and so takes the color of ""lug"", which is blue.
   - ""zup"" is independent and yellow.

Therefore, the deduction is as follows:
walm -> takes the color of the following word in the sequence, or if there is no following word, it takes the color of the last word with a defined color before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax
    ",Output: red green,red green,True,118
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently replaced with the color ""blue"" in the provided examples.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word 'dax' corresponds to the color 'green.' Here is the reasoning:

- When 'dax' appears alone, the output is 'green.'
- Whenever 'dax' appears in the input, no matter the position, 'green' appears in the output.

However, observing the transformation of other words, we note that 'lug' likely corresponds to 'blue,' 'walm' seems to correspond to a repetition of the direct previous color, 'zup' to 'yellow,' and 'bluf' varies between green and yellow based on its position relative to 'zup' ('zup' seems to change the meaning of 'bluf'). 'wif' seems to correspond to 'red.'

For example:
- 'lug dax walm' translates to 'blue green green green,' where 'walm' repeats the color 'green' from 'dax.'
- 'lug dax zup dax walm wif' translates to 'blue green yellow green green green red,' where 'walm' repeats the color 'green' again, and 'wif' gives 'red.'

From this, we can derive the rule:
Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we must identify the pattern associated with its output across different inputs:

- When the input was only ""wif,"" the output was ""red.""
- When the input was ""wif bluf,"" the output was ""red red,"" which suggests ""bluf"" also translates to ""red.""
- When the input included ""wif"" among other words, ""wif"" was consistently translated to ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
- The presence of ""wif"" in different contexts with different words didn't change its corresponding output; it was always ""red.""

From these observations, we can infer that the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red,"" and its meaning does not depend on context.

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look at the given examples where it is used and their respective outputs.

1. ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red""
2. ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" -> ""blue green green yellow blue red""
3. ""dax zup"" -> ""green yellow""
4. ""wif zup walm dax zup"" -> ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow""
5. ""dax zup"" -> ""green yellow""

From examples 3 and 5 which are both ""dax zup"" -> ""green yellow,"" we can see that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" immediately following the word ""dax,"" which translates to ""green.""

Looking at example 1, ""bluf"" translates to ""red,"" and since we are seeing ""zup"" translate to ""yellow"" when following ""bluf,"" we have preliminary evidence to suggest that ""zup"" alone may denote ""yellow.""

In example 2, ""zup"" is preceded by ""bluf"" and followed by ""lug,"" with ""zup"" producing ""yellow"" again. Given that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""bluf"" to ""red,"" we have further confirmation that ""zup"" does not change its output based on the preceding word.

Finally, example 4 shows ""zup"" generating ""yellow"" irrespective of being preceded by ""wif"" (red) or followed by ""dax"" (green) or ""walm."" Since ""walm"" translates to ""yellow"" as well, the repetition of the word ""yellow"" suggests ""zup"" is not influenced by adjacent words in this context either.

Rule: The word ""zup"" independently translates to ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the words it is surrounded by.

zup -> meaning. Meaning: ""yellow"".
Based on the examples provided, we can infer a pattern that the word ""bluf"" mimics the color of the word that comes immediately before it.

Here's how the rule applies in each example:

1. wif dax bluf -> red green green (bluf takes the color of ""dax"" which is green)
2. dax lug bluf -> green blue blue (bluf takes the color of ""lug"" which is blue)
3. wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> red blue blue yellow yellow green (first bluf takes the color of ""lug"" which is blue, second bluf takes the color of ""zup"" which is yellow)
4. wif bluf -> red red (bluf takes the color of ""wif"" which is red)
5. zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> yellow green green red yellow yellow blue (first bluf takes the color of ""dax"" which is green, second bluf takes the color of ""zup"" which is yellow) 

Rule: bluf -> The meaning of ""bluf"" is that it assumes the color of the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to the color blue (to be followed by as many yellows as there are preceding ""lug"" before the ""walm"" plus one additional yellow). This is seen in the following patterns:

1. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   Explanation: The ""walm"" does not follow any ""lug"", so it has three yellows followed by the color that corresponds to ""dax"" which is green.

2. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
   Explanation: Here, ""walm"" is preceded by one ""lug"" and is followed by one yellow, which adds up to a total of two yellows (one for the preceding ""lug"" and one additional).

3. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   Explanation: The ""walm"" that is preceded by two ""lug"" has three yellows following it, corresponding to the number of preceding ""lug"" plus one additional yellow.

4. Input: lug walm zup
   Output: blue blue blue yellow
   Explanation: The ""walm"" is preceded by one ""lug"" and thus is followed by two yellows, one for the preceding ""lug"" and one additional.

5. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   Explanation: Similar to the fourth example, but the ""dax"" corresponds to green as is consistent with the first example.

Walm -> Initial output is blue, followed by a sequence of yellows where the count of yellows equals the count of preceding ""lug"" plus one more yellow.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup lug zup lug
    ",Output: yellow blue yellow blue,yellow blue yellow blue,True,119
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
By examining the examples and outputs provided, one can notice a pattern where ""lug"" consistently corresponds to a single color in the output:

- In example 1, ""lug"" is followed by ""dax"" and the output is ""yellow blue"".
- In example 2, ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"" and the output is ""blue blue blue"".
- In example 3, ""lug"" is followed by ""zup"" and the output is ""blue yellow"".
- In example 4, ""lug"" precedes ""zup"" and the output is ""blue yellow"".
- In example 5, ""lug"" precedes ""wif"" and the output is ""blue red"".

Based on these associations, it seems that ""lug"" always corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the word that follows or precedes it. Thus:

lug -> meaning: lug means ""blue"". Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, the color ""blue"" appears in the same position in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: Based on the provided examples, every time the word 'dax' appears in the input, it corresponds to the word 'green' in the output, irrespective of its position in the sequence. Thus, 'dax' means 'green'.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The term ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the consistent patterns in the examples:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red.""
- When ""bluf"" is between ""lug"" and another word or follows ""lug,"" the output is ""red.""

Notice that ""bluf"" seems to duplicate the color corresponding to the word before it:

- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow; when followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow"" twice.
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red; when followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""red"" twice.
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, but when ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""red"" instead of ""blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" doesn't duplicate blue but instead outputs red.

Given this information, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" duplicates the color word preceding it, except when that color is blue, in which case ""bluf"" translates to red.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the preceding word unless that color is blue, then it outputs red.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word that comes directly before it three times. Here's the breakdown:

- ""lug wif walm"" translates to ""blue red red red,"" meaning that ""wif"" is red and ""walm"" causes ""red"" to repeat three times.
- ""lug dax walm wif"" translates to ""blue green green green red,"" meaning that ""dax"" is green and ""walm"" causes ""green"" to repeat three times before moving on to the next word ""wif"" which is red.
- ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red,"" supporting the rule that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the prior word to repeat three times.
- ""dax walm zup walm"" translates to ""green green green yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""dax"" is green, followed by ""walm"" repeating ""green"" three times, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times.
- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" which further supports the rule since ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and repeats the color ""green"" three times.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow blue,yellow yellow yellow blue,True,120
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce a pattern that relates to the word ""dax"" and its output. Let's thoroughly analyze the examples:

Input: dax zup
Output: green yellow
- ""dax"" precedes ""zup"" and is translated to ""green"" while ""zup"" is ""yellow"".

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
- ""wif"" and ""bluf"" translate to ""red"" (each), ""dax"" translates to ""green"", and ""walm"" appears to translate to two ""green"" outputs.

Input: dax zup dax walm
Output: green yellow green green green
- The pattern for ""dax"" remains consistent with ""green"", ""zup"" with ""yellow"", and ""walm"" again is paired with two ""green"" outputs after ""dax"".

Input: zup dax lug walm zup
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
- We see ""zup"" translating to ""yellow"" both times, ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""lug"" followed by ""walm"" gives ""blue blue blue"".

Input: lug dax zup dax wif
Output: blue green yellow green red
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""wif"" to ""red"".

From the above analysis, the rule appears straightforward for ""dax"": it translates consistently to ""green"" in every instance. There's no apparent variation or context dependency in the translation of ""dax.""

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's examine the input and output pairs:

1. lug wif dax -> blue red green
2. wif bluf -> red red
3. wif -> red
4. wif dax bluf -> red green green
5. lug dax bluf wif dax -> blue green green red green

Analyzing the examples:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears, ""red"" is in the output.
- ""wif"" by itself results in ""red"".
- ""wif"" appears to be independent of its position in the sequence, as it always translates to ""red"" regardless of where it is placed.

Hence, the rule we can induce is:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rules for the words lug, wif, and dax in relation to colors:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green

Nothing in the context changes these associations; they are consistent across all examples. The word ""zup"" always corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" is:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Each nonce word is associated with a specific color, and ""zup"" is always associated with the color yellow.
Analyzing the provided examples, we can infer the following correlations:

1. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
2. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
3. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
4. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

The word ""bluf"" appears after each correlated color and duplicates that color's output in the sequence. For instance:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and the output for ""lug"" is ""blue,"" so the output associated with ""bluf"" is another ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output for ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" so the output associated with ""bluf"" is another ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output for ""dax"" is ""green,"" so the output associated with ""bluf"" is another ""green.""

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" is that it outputs the same color as the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning = Duplicate the color of the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be:

Whenever ""walm"" is mentioned in the input, the output is a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word that immediately precedes ""walm"". Here is how the rule applies to each example:

1. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   Rule application: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and since ""walm"" follows ""zup"", the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.

2. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   Rule application: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and since ""walm"" follows ""lug"", the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.

3. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red
   Rule application: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and since ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the output is ""green"" repeated three times.

4. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   Rule application: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and since ""walm"" follows ""zup"", the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.

5. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Rule application: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and since ""walm"" follows ""lug"", the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is: 

walm -> When following a word, the output is the color corresponding to the preceding word repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm lug walm wif zup dax
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow blue blue blue red yellow green,yellow yellow yellow blue blue blue red yellow green,True,121
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To determine the meaning of ""lug,"" we will look for patterns in the given examples. We know that the presence of the word ""lug"" must alter the output in some way since it is consistently present and is always associated with ""blue"" at the start of each output.

Let's compare the inputs to the outputs:

1. Input: ""lug walm wif zup wif""
   Output: ""blue blue blue red yellow red""
   Here, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and ""wif,"" resulting in two ""blue"" outputs followed by a ""red."" ""Zup"" gives us ""yellow,"" followed by ""red"" paired with the second ""wif.""

2. Input: ""lug bluf""
   Output: ""blue blue""
   ""Lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" resulting in two ""blue"" outputs.

3. Input: ""lug zup""
   Output: ""blue yellow""
   ""Lug"" precedes ""zup,"" which results in ""blue yellow.""

4. Input: ""lug walm dax wif lug wif""
   Output: ""blue blue blue green red blue red""
   This is a longer sequence, but we can notice that ""lug"" is repeated here. Before its second occurrence, ""walm"" and ""dax"" each result in ""blue"" and ""green,"" and ""wif"" results in ""red."" After the second ""lug,"" ""wif"" once again results in ""red.""

5. Input: ""lug dax""
   Output: ""blue green""
   Here, ""lug"" precedes ""dax,"" resulting in ""blue green.""

From these examples, we can induce the following rule:
- ""Lug"" always results in the output starting with ""blue."" After this initial ""blue,"" the color that follows seems dependent on the word that immediately follows ""lug."" From the examples, ""walm"" and ""bluf"" result in ""blue,"" ""dax"" results in ""green,"" ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" results in ""red.""

Based on this pattern, the rule appears to be:
- ""lug"" initiates a color sequence starting with ""blue,"" and the color that immediately follows depends on the word after ""lug,"" with each word corresponding to a specific color. ""Wif"" always seems to indicate a ""red"" color regardless of its position.

Therefore, based on these examples, the rule is as follows:
Rule: ""lug"" -> initiates a sequence with ""blue,"" followed by a color corresponding to the following word.
Based on the examples given, the word ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green."" It appears that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. The following are the associations that can be made from the data:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> blue (though ""bluf"" isn't directly shown in the examples, it contains ""blu"" which seems to correspond to the color blue)
- walm -> yellow (indicated by repeated occurrences resulting in the color yellow)

Rule: Each nonce word represents a unique color. ""Dax"" in particular represents the color green.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we will compare the inputs with the corresponding outputs. Let's analyze the examples.

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

   - When ""wif"" is the first word, the output is ""red.""
   - The word ""lug"" appears twice and corresponds to ""blue"" both times.
   - ""dax"" is last and corresponds to ""green.""

2. Input: dax wif lug dax
   Output: green red blue green

   - ""dax"" at the beginning corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""wif"" now is second and corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""lug"" still corresponds to ""blue.""

3. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue

   - ""wif"" again is first and corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

4. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green

   - ""wif"" is at the beginning and corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

5. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
   
   - ""dax"" at the beginning corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - ""wif"" is now third and corresponds to ""red.""

From the examples, it can be seen that regardless of its position in the input sequence, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" in the output sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color yellow.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" dictates repeating the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here's how we can derive the rule:

- In the first example, ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"" and ""dax"" with ""green."" Since ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" the output is ""blue green green.""

- In the second example, ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"" and ""lug"" with ""blue."" ""Bluf"" comes after ""lug,"" so the output is ""yellow blue blue.""

- In the third example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" With ""bluf"" coming after ""zup,"" the output is ""green yellow yellow.""

- In the fourth example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" Followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue red red.""

- In the fifth example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" isn't associated with a color, ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""wif"" with ""red."" Since ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" and the last instance of ""lug"" was prior to ""wif,"" the output reflects this as ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red.""

So, ""bluf"" means repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the word just before ""bluf"" in the output sequence.
Based on the provided examples, we can induce that ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the word that comes directly before it. 

Rules seen from the examples:

1. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue,"" with ""zup"" being associated with the color yellow, and the number of ""yellow"" words being one more than the number of ""walm"" words.
2. ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" is associated with the color blue, and there are two ""walm"" words after ""lug,"" resulting in two additional blues.
3. ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" is ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow."" ""wif"" is associated with red, and ""walm"" repeats this color three times, while ""zup"" is associated with yellow, which is again repeated three times after a single occurrence of ""walm.""
4. ""wif walm dax zup"" turns into ""red red red green yellow."" The pattern of repeating the color of the preceding word is consistent.
5. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" results in ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow."" Once again, ""zup"" is associated with yellow, which is repeated three times due to the single occurrence of ""walm"" after it.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the directly preceding word. If the preceding word's color is unknown, this rule cannot apply.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,122
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples given, we can determine the meaning of the word ""lug"" by analyzing the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Here is the analysis:

- In every instance where ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
- The other words in the input such as ""wif"", ""zup"", ""bluf"", and ""dax"" seem to correspond with ""red"", ""yellow"", ""blue"", and ""green"" respectively.

Let's review the appearances of ""lug"":

1. Input: wif lug — Output: red blue
2. Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf — Output: blue red red green blue blue
3. Input: wif zup lug wif — Output: red yellow blue red
4. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug — Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
5. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup — Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

In every case, the presence of ""lug"" in the input results in ""blue"" in the output, suggesting a direct translation from the nonce word ""lug"" to the color ""blue"".

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, each instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green."" It does not appear to change meaning regardless of its position within the sentence or the presence of other words. Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" is encountered, it translates to the color ""green.""
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's examine the context in which it is used and its related outputs:

1. ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue""
2. ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green""
3. ""zup dax walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow green green green blue red""
4. ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" translates to ""blue green green yellow blue red""
5. ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue"" again.

Looking at examples 1 and 5, which are exactly the same, it seems that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" This is further supported by the initial ""wif"" in examples 2 and 4, where the first color in the output is also ""red.""

Now, let's consider the position of 'wif' in each sequence. 

In examples 1 and 5, ""wif"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the output is ""red blue."" In example 3, ""wif"" is at the end, following ""lug,"" and the output ends with ""blue red"". Similarly, in example 4, which ends with ""wif,"" the output also ends with ""red."" This suggests that ""wif"" does not change meaning based on its position in the sequence.

The color that appears after ""red"" in the output seems to depend on the word that follows ""wif."" In every output, the color that comes after ""red"" is the color that the word after ""wif"" translates to. For example:

- ""lug"" always translates to ""blue.""
- ""bluf"" always translates to ""red.""
- ""dax"" always translates to ""green.""

Therefore, it seems that ""wif"" itself translates to ""red,"" and the word following ""wif"" maintains its corresponding color in the output sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided input-output pairs, it seems that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output. The other words correlate with other colors as well: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> repeats the color of the word preceding it.

Rule: If a word (X) is followed by the word ""bluf,"" the output color for ""bluf"" is the same as the output color for word X. Here's how the rule applies to the given examples:

- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""wif.""
- ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""dax.""
- ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and the final ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
- ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""zup.""
- ""zup lug bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue blue"" because ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""lug.""
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we look at the pattern of words and their corresponding colors:

From the first input-output pair:
- The word ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green.""
- The word ""wif"" correlates with the color ""green"" when followed by ""walm"" but ""red"" otherwise.
- The word ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow.""

In the occurrences of ""walm"":
1. ""dax walm wif walm zup"" -> green green green red red red yellow 
   - After ""walm,"" the next word changes its color: ""wif"" changes from its usual red to green after being preceded by ""walm.""
2. ""dax walm wif dax"" -> green green green red green
   - ""wif"" is red as usual because it is not preceded directly by ""walm.""
3. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" -> red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   - The first ""wif"" is red, then ""lug"" and ""zup"" follow their usual pattern, but after ""walm"" ""wif"" changes to yellow instead of its usual red.
4. ""dax walm zup"" -> green green green yellow 
   - The pattern holds with ""zup"" following its usual yellow after ""walm.""
5. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" -> blue red yellow red red red
   - ""wif"" is usually red and remains red before and after ""walm.""

From the above observations, ""walm"" does not seem to have a consistent direct correlation with a specific color. Instead, ""walm"" appears to affect the color associated with the word that follows it. The rule seems to be that when ""walm"" precedes a word, it changes the usual color association of the subsequent word. In examples 2 and 3, ""wif"" changes color when it follows ""walm,"" although the particular color it changes to varies (green in the first case, yellow in the second), which suggests that more context might be needed to fully understand ""walm."" Since example 3 provides a new coloration (yellow) for ""wif"" that isn't consistent with the earlier pattern, it complicates the induction of a simple rule.

Given the data, ""walm"" could indicate a modifier that changes the color association of the following word, or it could signal a more complex pattern that requires further context to decipher fully. However, with the data provided, a clear and consistent definition of ""walm"" cannot be confidently established.

Rule: ""walm"" seems to act as a modifier that changes the usual color association of the subsequent word, although the exact change is not consistently indicated across the examples.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,123
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"", regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words surrounding it. The other words in the input sequences (""lug"" and ""wif"") translate to ""blue"" and ""red"" respectively, while ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"". There does not seem to be any contextual dependency or variation in the meaning of ""dax""; it consistently corresponds to the same output across all examples.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. The word 'wif' consistently translates to the color 'red'. The other words must correlate to other colors in a one-to-one manner, evident from their repeated outputs. Therefore:

- 'wif' corresponds to 'red'
- 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'
- 'walm' corresponds to 'red'
- 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'
- 'dax' corresponds to 'green'

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided. Each unique word seems to correspond to a specific color. We can use the inputs and outputs to map words to colors:

- ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue.""
- ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red.""
- ""walm"" maps to three ""red"" in a row, suggesting the repetition of the color red.
- ""bluf"" maps to two ""yellow,"" implying a duplication in color.
- ""dax"" maps to ""green.""

To figure out what zup means, let us note whenever ""zup"" appears and what color it corresponds to:

- ""zup"" in all cases maps to ""yellow.""

Given all examples, we can induce that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow."" 

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, bluf seems to correspond with the output color that directly follows the color represented by the word preceding it. However, unlike the other nonce words (lug, wif, dax, zup, walm), which have a one-to-one correspondence with specific colors (lug -> blue, wif -> red, dax -> green, zup -> yellow, walm -> red), bluf's output depends on the color immediately preceding it in the input.

We can determine the rule by examining how the output color changes when bluf is used:

1. lug wif lug bluf results in blue red blue blue - Here, bluf follows lug (which corresponds to blue) and the output is also blue.

2. lug wif dax bluf wif lug results in blue red green green red blue - Here, bluf follows dax (green) and the output is green.

3. dax bluf wif zup results in green green red yellow - Here, bluf follows dax (green) and the output is green again.

4. zup bluf wif walm results in yellow yellow red red red - Here, bluf follows zup (yellow) and the output is yellow.

5. lug wif lug dax bluf results in blue red blue green green - Here, bluf follows dax (green) and the output is green.

From these examples, we can infer the following rule for bluf:

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word before bluf.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs:

- When ""lug walm"" is input, the output is ""blue blue blue."" This suggests that ""lug"" corresponds to a single ""blue,"" and ""walm"" to a repetition of ""blue.""

- In the second example, ""zup bluf lug zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" has not been mentioned in other examples but in this context, it still results in ""blue"" (same as ""lug""), and we see ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of ""yellow,"" the color associated with ""zup.""

- The third input, ""zup wif dax walm lug,"" corresponds to ""yellow red green green green blue."" Here, we can see ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" results in repeating the color that precedes it (""green"" in this case).

- In ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm,"" the output is ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue."" Each instance of ""walm"" causes the preceding color word (""wif"" for ""red"" and ""lug"" for ""blue"") to be repeated.

- Finally, ""dax walm wif"" results in ""green green green red."" Here again, ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""walm"" results in ""green"" being repeated.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color word that comes before it.

Rule: walm -> repeats the preceding color word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given outputs.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

- Every instance of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to ""green"" in the output.
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" while ""bluf"" appears to correspond to ""green"" as well.
- ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.

From these observations, we can infer the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently correlates with the color ""red"" in the output regardless of its position in the input string or the other words present. Here's the breakdown:

- Input: wif zup dax bluf -> Output: red yellow green green (wif is the first word and corresponds to red)
- Input: lug dax wif -> Output: blue green red (wif is the third word and corresponds to red)
- Input: zup dax wif -> Output: yellow green red (wif is the third word and corresponds to red)
- Input: zup wif bluf zup lug -> Output: yellow red red yellow blue (wif is the second word and corresponds to red)
- Input: lug wif -> Output: blue red (wif is the second word and corresponds to red)

None of the provided examples indicate any variance in the meaning of ""wif"" based on context; it consistently translates to ""red.""

Rule:
wif -> red
Looking at the patterns in the given examples, the task is to ascertain the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" based on the other words' outputs.

Let's analyze each input and associated output:

1. ""dax walm wif walm zup"" -> ""green green green red red red yellow""
2. ""zup dax wif"" -> ""yellow green red""
3. ""zup bluf dax"" -> ""yellow yellow green""
4. ""wif walm zup walm"" -> ""red red red yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax"" -> ""red red yellow red blue green""

From these examples, we see the following:
- ""dax"" is always converting to ""green"".
- ""wif"" is always converting to ""red"".
- ""bluf"" seems to always convert to ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup"" and to ""blue"" in other contexts.
- ""lug"" is always converting to ""blue"".
- ""zup"" results in outputs that are exactly repeated colors from previous terms, always ending with ""yellow"".

Given this, it's reasonable to infer that ""zup"" could mean ""repeat the preceding colors (or possibly words) followed by a yellow"".

So if we convert this into a rule, we get:

zup -> Repeat the preceding colors (or output pattern) in sequence until a yellow is reached.

This rule seems consistent with all provided examples. If ""zup"" always had to be followed by a ""yellow"", it would explain why there is always a yellow at the end of the outputs containing ""zup"". The repetition of the preceding colors before the yellow in the output for the inputs containing ""zup"" seems to confirm this rule.
Based on the input-output pairs provided, we can deduce that each word is associated with a specific color:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" seems to take on the color that was just previously mentioned

To confirm this, let's look at each example:

1. ""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green""

2. ""zup bluf dax"" -> ""yellow yellow green""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow""

3. ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow green yellow green red red""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red""

4. ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green yellow red green green""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green""

5. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" is not provided in the input-output pairs, but it follows ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green,"" so it might also correspond to ""green"" based on the pattern.

Given these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the word immediately before it. If ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" its color is ""red""; if it follows ""dax,"" its color is ""green""; if it follows ""zup,"" its color is ""yellow"".
Rule: walm -> the color associated with the word directly preceding it repeated three times. 

Examples based on the rule:

- ""wif zup walm dax zup"" = ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow"" because ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which is associated with the color yellow, and ""walm"" turns into ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- ""dax walm"" = ""green green green,"" since ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to the color green, resulting in ""green green green.""
- ""lug walm"" = ""blue blue blue,"" as ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which is associated with blue, thus producing ""blue blue blue.""
- ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" includes two instances of ""walm."" The first follows ""wif"" (red), leading to ""red red red,"" and the second follows ""wif"" again, resulting in another ""red red red.""
- ""dax walm wif bluf"" has ""walm"" following ""dax"" (green), which leads to ""green green green."" The colors following ""wif"" and ""bluf"" do not include ""walm,"" hence they remain as the colors corresponding to those words: ""red red.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:

Rule: Every time the word ""lug"" appears, the output is invariably ""blue"", regardless of what follows or whether ""lug"" is presented alone. Thus, ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".
Rule: dax -> green

Explanation: Each time the word ""dax"" appears in an input, ""green"" is included in the corresponding output, indicating that ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
wif -> red. 

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds directly to the color ""yellow"". Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
From the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that is mentioned twice in a row in the output. Looking at each example:

1. In ""lug bluf wif,"" the output is ""blue blue red."" Here ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue,"" which is repeated.

2. In ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf,"" the output is ""red green yellow red green green."" Here ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" which appears twice consecutively.

3. In ""dax bluf wif,"" the output is ""green green red."" Here again, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" which is repeated.

4. In ""lug wif bluf,"" the output is ""blue red red."" Here ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" which is repeated.

5. In ""lug zup bluf dax,"" the output is ""blue yellow yellow green."" In this case, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" which is repeated.

Rule: bluf -> the color that is immediately repeated or the color that is to be repeated next after its occurrence.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" affects the color words that follow it. Specifically, it seems to cause the following color word in the sequence to repeat for the number of total unique color words that have appeared in the sequence before ""walm"". Here is the breakdown:

1. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"". Since ""green"" is the only color word before ""walm"", it repeats three times.

2. ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" translates to ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow"". Before ""walm"", there are four unique color words: red, yellow, blue, green. After ""walm"", ""yellow"" repeats four times in total (once before and three times after ""walm"").

3. ""lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". In this case, there are two unique colors: blue and yellow. After ""walm"", ""yellow"" repeats three times (once before and twice after ""walm"").

4. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" translates to ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow"". There are four unique colors before ""walm"" and thus ""yellow"" repeats four times in total.

5. ""dax lug wif walm"" translates to ""green blue red red red"". Before ""walm"", there are three unique colors, so ""red"" is repeated three times after ""walm"".

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of the context in which it is used. Any other word following ""lug"" corresponds to a different color; for example, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
wif -> red

Rule: Each time the word ""wif"" appears, it is translated to the color ""red"".
Rule: zup corresponds to the color that should be utilized for the word that directly follows it. If there is no word following zup, then zup defaults to the color yellow.

Explanation of Rule Application:

Example 1: ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" translates to ""green green red yellow green"". Here, zup precedes dax, which is green, and thus zup takes on the color yellow, which acts as a placeholder to indicate the color of the word following it.

Example 2: ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue"". zup does not follow any word in the sequence, thus it is yellow. Wif is red, walm is red, and lug is blue as their default colors.

Example 3: ""dax zup"" translates to ""green yellow"". Here, zup follows dax and thus takes the color yellow since there is no word following zup.

Example 4: ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"". Here, zup is followed by bluf, which has the default color yellow, and as per the rule stated, zup adopts the upcoming color.

Example 5: ""wif dax zup"" translates to ""red green yellow"". In this sequence, zup is following the word dax, so it takes the color yellow given there is no word after zup.

Given the examples provided and the deduction from their patterns, zup's color is dependent on the context—it stands for yellow when there's no word after it, but when there is, it signifies that the following word's color should be considered the output for zup. 

Thus, the rule is: zup -> yellow or the color of the next word if there is one.
bluf -> ""red"" after a color word duplicates that color word

Rule: Whenever bluf follows a color word (lug, wif, dax, or zup), it generates an output of that color word followed by ""red"". For instance, ""lug bluf"" becomes ""blue red"", ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red"", ""dax bluf"" becomes ""green green"", and ""zup bluf"" becomes ""yellow yellow red"". If bluf appears without a preceding color word, it translates to ""green"" on its own, as shown in ""dax bluf"" producing ""green green"".
Based on the given examples, we can observe that ""walm"" consistently translates to a sequence of three identical colors. By looking at what follows ""walm"" in each input, we can determine the rule for the color that is output:

1. In the first example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue."" The word after ""walm"" is not given, but ""lug"" before ""walm"" translates to ""blue,"" so it's possible that ""walm"" means to repeat the color of the word immediately before it three times.
   
2. In the second example, ""dax walm zup lug"" results in ""green green green yellow blue."" In this case, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which translates to ""green,"" and ""walm"" results in ""green green green,"" following the pattern from the first example.

3. In the third example, ""zup wif lug zup walm"" results in ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow."" ""Walm"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" and the output for ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" again supporting the previous pattern.

4. The fourth example, ""zup walm lug zup wif dax,"" gets the output of ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green."" Here ""walm"" again follows ""zup"" and translates to ""yellow yellow yellow.""

5. The fifth example, ""zup dax walm lug wif,"" has the output ""yellow green green green blue red."" ""Walm"" comes after ""dax"" and results in ""green green green.""

From these observations, we can conclude that the word ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the word immediately before it, three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,127
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> change each preceding word to its corresponding color and repeat it the number of times given by the position it appears in the sequence. Rule:
- The first word before ""lug"" is changed to its corresponding color and mentioned once.
- The second word before ""lug"" is changed to its corresponding color and mentioned twice, and so on.

For instance, in the input ""wif lug"", ""wif"" is the first and only word before ""lug"", so it is changed to ""red"" and mentioned once, followed by ""blue"" since ""lug"" adds the color blue at every occurrence.

In the input ""zup wif lug wif"", ""zup wif"" is before ""lug"", ""zup"" is the first word which corresponds to ""yellow"" and is mentioned once, ""wif"" is the second word which corresponds to ""red"" and is mentioned twice, followed by ""blue"" for ""lug"", and then ""wif"" is after ""lug"", which just adds ""red"" without affecting other patterns.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" I will analyze the patterns associated with the use of the word ""dax"" in the given examples and the corresponding outputs.

Input: dax
Output: green
Rule: dax -> green

Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green
Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" is observed after ""lug dax"", which leads to two additional ""green""s suggesting a pattern where ""dax walm"" results in ""green green"".

Input: dax lug
Output: green blue
Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""lug"" corresponds to blue

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which also leads to yellow, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" yielding another blue, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""lug"" again corresponds to blue, following ""dax.""

Input: dax
Output: green
Rule: dax -> green

From these observations, it is consistently shown that ""dax"" correlates to the output ""green."" The other words seem to correlate to other colors, but ""dax"" is the only word to consistently result in ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Observing the examples given, we can try to identify a pattern for the word 'wif' based on its position and the words around it, as well as the output colors. Here's the breakdown:

In the first example:
- ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue red green green red"".
  The ""wif"" occurs between two different colors and translates to ""red"". After ""bluf"", ""wif"" again translates to ""red"".
  
In the second example:
- ""wif lug dax"" translates to ""red blue green"".
  Here, ""wif"" comes first and translates to ""red"".
  
In the third example:
- ""zup walm wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow red"".
  ""wif"" is at the end and translates to ""red"" after ""walm"" which repeats the color of the word before it (yellow).
  
In the fourth example:
- ""wif dax zup bluf"" translates to ""red green yellow yellow"".
  ""wif"" starts the sequence and translates to ""red"".
  
In the fifth example:
- ""dax lug wif walm"" translates to ""green blue red red red"".
  ""wif"" follows two different colors and precedes a color repetition (""walm""), translating to ""red"".

Based on these observations, ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"", regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words. The output for ""wif"" does not seem to be influenced by the position or the surroundings, as it consistently results in the color ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red
Observing the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" by comparing the input to the output in each instance.

Reviewing all inputs and outputs:

1. Input: zup wif zup
   Output: yellow red yellow
   - ""zup"" appears twice and corresponds to ""yellow"" both times.
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

2. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
   Output: red green yellow red green green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
   - ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red"".
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""green"".

3. Input: zup wif lug wif
   Output: yellow red blue red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
   - ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red"".
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

4. Input: zup lug bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue blue red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""blue"".
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

5. Input: zup bluf dax
   Output: yellow yellow green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""yellow"".
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Given these examples, each instance of ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the surrounding words. Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To determine the meaning or the rule behind ""bluf,"" let's analyze the color patterns that emerge each time ""bluf"" is used.

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

2. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green

3. Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
   Output: yellow red red yellow blue

4. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red

5. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

Now, let's look for a consistent pattern in the use of ""bluf"" across the examples:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by a single color (green), even though it is preceded by both ""wif"" and ""dax,"" which correlate to red and green respectively. However, the color green is repeated twice.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" (green) and is followed by green. 
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is sandwiched between ""wif"" (red) and another ""zup,"" yet it correlates to red, not mixed or a new color.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is after ""wif"" (red) and the output is red.
- In the fifth example, there are two instances of ""bluf."" Each time it's following a different word (""dax"" and ""zup"") and both times the output for ""bluf"" is the same as the preceding color (green and yellow, respectively).

Based on this analysis, it appears that ""bluf"" indicates the repetition of the color of the word immediately before it. When ""bluf"" is present, it inherits the color from the preceding word, but does not create a color on its own.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the previous word.
The rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it two additional times. Therefore, when ""walm"" follows a word, the output color for that word is given once followed by two more of the same color for ""walm"".

Here are the mappings from the input words to colors, based on the examples:
dax -> green
lug -> blue
wif -> red
zup -> yellow (Note: ""zup"" does not seem to influence ""walm,"" as ""walm"" follows the color of the word directly before it.)

Now, applying the rule we deduced to each case:

1. ""dax walm zup"" gives us ""green green"" (for ""dax walm"") then ""yellow"" for ""zup"".
2. ""lug walm zup walm"" gives us ""blue blue"" (for ""lug walm"") then ""yellow"" for ""zup"" and then ""yellow yellow"" for ""walm"" after ""zup"".
3. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" gives us ""red"" for ""wif"", ""blue"" for ""lug"", ""yellow"" for ""zup"", ""yellow yellow"" for ""walm"" after ""zup"", then again ""red"" for ""wif"" and ""blue"" for ""lug"".
4. ""dax walm wif walm"" gives us ""green green"" for ""dax walm"", ""red"" for ""wif"" and ""red red"" for ""walm"" after ""wif"".
5. ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" gives us ""blue blue"" for ""lug walm"", ""green"" for ""dax"", ""red"" for ""wif"", then ""blue"" for ""lug"" followed by ""red"" for the last ""wif"".

Hence the rule for ""walm"" is: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word two additional times.

Rule: walm -> Duplicate the color of the word just before it, two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,128
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Every instance of ""lug"" in the input is translated to ""blue"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look for patterns in the examples provided.

In each instance where ""dax"" appears, we can look at the subsequent word to try to identify a pattern in the output.

1. wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
2. wif dax wif lug wif -> red green red blue red
3. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
4. zup dax walm lug wif -> yellow green green green blue red
5. dax walm -> green green green

Analyzing these pairs:

- From example 1), after ""dax"" comes ""zup,"" and the corresponding output color is green. Next color after green is yellow.
- From example 2), after ""dax"" comes ""wif,"" and the corresponding output color is green. Next color after green is red.
- From example 3), after ""dax"" comes ""lug,"" and the corresponding output color is green. Next color after green is blue.
- From example 4), after ""dax"" comes ""walm,"" and the corresponding output color is green. Next color after green is green.
- From example 5), after ""dax"" comes ""walm,"" and the corresponding output color is green. It is followed by more greens.

From these observations, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to an output color ""green,"" and subsequently, it indicates the repetition of the next color output. 

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
- ""dax"" causes the next color to repeat.

Using this induction, we can now define ""dax"":
Rule: dax -> causes the next color in the sequence to repeat.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the color ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

Here's the breakdown:

1. lug wif lug dax bluf -> blue red blue green green
2. dax wif -> green red
3. wif -> red
4. dax lug wif -> green blue red
5. dax wif zup dax -> green red yellow green

In each of these examples, ""wif"" alone translates to ""red,"" and when it's used in a sequence, no other word alters this translation.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Every time ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, the color ""yellow"" appears in the exact same position in the output.

Here is a breakdown of each example that supports this conclusion:

- Input: zup wif lug dax -> Output: yellow red blue green
  (""zup"" is first and corresponds to ""yellow"")

- Input: zup -> Output: yellow
  (""zup"" is the only word and corresponds to ""yellow"")

- Input: wif zup lug wif -> Output: red yellow blue red
  (""zup"" is the second word and corresponds to ""yellow"")

- Input: lug dax zup -> Output: blue green yellow
  (""zup"" is the third word and corresponds to ""yellow"")

- Input: zup bluf wif bluf -> Output: yellow yellow red red
  (""zup"" is the first word and corresponds to ""yellow"")

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" directly corresponds to a repetition of the color that precedes it. If a color word is said once followed by ""bluf,"" the output color will be repeated. Here's the breakdown:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and when followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and when followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and when followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Repeat the color mentioned before ""bluf.""
Analyzing the given examples where the input includes ""walm"" and looking at the corresponding output, the following pattern can be observed:

- Every time the word ""walm"" appears in the input, the output is a repetition of three colors.
- The color that is repeated three times is always the color that corresponds to the word that appears directly before ""walm"" in the input.

From the examples:

1. Input: ""dax walm"" -> Output: ""green green green""
2. Input: ""lug wif dax zup walm"" -> Output: ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow""
   (The color ""yellow"" is repeated three times, which corresponds to the word ""zup"" that comes directly before ""walm"".)
3. Input: ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" -> Output: ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow""
   (The word ""walm"" appears twice here; first, it repeats the color ""red,"" which corresponds to ""wif,"" and then it repeats ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup"".)
4. Input: ""dax walm"" -> Output: ""green green green""
5. Input: ""zup wif walm lug"" -> Output: ""yellow red red red blue""
   (The color ""red"" is repeated three times, which corresponds to the word ""wif"" that comes directly before ""walm"".)

Based on this pattern, the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be a rule where ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately before it to be repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif zup bluf
    ",Output: green red yellow yellow,green red yellow yellow,True,129
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given outputs. The position of ""lug"" within the input does not affect this translation.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the outputs. Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" is outputted in the corresponding position.
Based on the examples provided, when ""wif"" appears alone, the output is ""red."" When it appears in combination with other words, ""wif"" also yields ""red,"" and other words yield different colors. 

For example: 
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output sequence starts with ""red blue.""
- The phrase ""wif dax zup bluf"" translates to ""red green yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""green,"" ""yellow,"" and ""yellow,"" respectively.

From this, it seems that ""wif"" does not depend on its position within the input string to determine its output—it always translates to ""red."" However, the output for other words may be influenced by their position or presence alongside ""wif.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" 

Here's how this rule applies to each example:

- ""dax zup"" translates to ""green yellow,"" where ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow.""
- ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red,"" where other words such as ""lug"" and ""walm"" correspond to colors (""blue"" and ""blue"" respectively), and ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""dax wif zup"" translates to ""green red yellow,"" maintaining the association of ""zup"" with ""yellow.""
- ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow,"" where ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow.""
- ""zup wif zup"" translates to ""yellow red yellow,"" where ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""zup"" is again ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns in the examples provided:

1. When ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" is the input, the output is ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue"". Here the non-bluf sequence ""zup lug zup lug"" would likely correspond to ""yellow blue yellow blue"", so the presence of ""bluf"" changed the 3rd term from ""blue"" to ""yellow.""

2. In the input ""zup wif bluf,"" the output is ""yellow red red."" Without ""bluf,"" a reasonable assumption for ""zup wif"" might be ""yellow red"", suggesting ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""

3. For the input ""lug bluf dax lug,"" the output is ""blue blue green blue."" If ""bluf"" was not present we might assume ""lug dax lug"" translates to ""blue green blue,"" suggesting ""bluf"" translates to ""blue.""

4. When the input is ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug,"" the resulting output is ""blue red green green red blue."" If ""bluf"" were removed, an expected pattern for ""lug wif dax wif lug"" would be ""blue red green red blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" replacing ""dax"" results in ""green.""

5. Lastly, the input ""zup bluf dax lug"" yields the output ""yellow yellow green blue."" Without ""bluf,"" one could anticipate ""zup dax lug"" to be ""yellow green blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" replaced ""dax"" with ""yellow.""

Considering the examples above, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color of the word immediately before it. Whenever ""bluf"" appears after a color word, it replicates that color word in the output.

Rule:
bluf -> Repeats the color of the preceding word in the sequence.
To discern the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the consistencies in the inputs and outputs:

1. When ""lug walm"" is inputted, the output is ""blue blue blue."" This suggests that ""lug"" maps to a single ""blue,"" and ""walm"" may cause a repetition of the color word that precedes it three times.

2. With the input ""dax lug dax lug walm,"" the output is ""green blue green blue blue blue."" This reinforces the idea that ""walm"" repeats the preceding color word three times, as we have ""dax"" mapping to ""green,"" ""lug"" mapping to ""blue,"" and then ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times. 

3. ""zup walm"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which further supports the notion that ""walm"" repeats the color related to the word before it three times, with ""zup"" mapping to ""yellow.""

4. ""zup lug walm"" translating to ""yellow blue blue blue"" aligns with this rule, since ""zup"" gives us ""yellow,"" ""lug"" gives us ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats the last said color three times.

5. Finally, ""dax walm zup lug"" becomes ""green green green yellow blue."" ""Dax"" is ""green,"" ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" The colors are sequential, with no repetition around ""zup"" and ""lug"" afterwards, because ""walm"" has already occurred.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times. 

Hence, walm -> causes the preceding color word to be said three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug bluf dax
    ",Output: blue blue green,blue blue green,True,130
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in each given example.
Based on the given examples, it seems that each word is associated with a color. The word 'dax' consistently results in 'green' no matter its position in the input sequence. Each of the other words ('bluf', 'wif', 'zup', 'lug') appears to be associated with a different color as well ('bluf' with blue, 'wif' with red, 'zup' with yellow, 'lug' with blue).

Therefore, the rule that can be deduced is:

Rule: The word dax, when used, corresponds to the color green.

So,

dax -> green
Based on the examples provided:

- When ""wif walm"" is the input, the output is ""red red red"". ""Walm"" by itself doesn't appear in any of the examples, but its presence alongside ""wif"" results in repeated ""red"", suggesting that ""wif"" might mean ""red"" and ""walm"" may influence the repetition of the color.
- When ""wif"" appears alone, the output is ""red"", reinforcing that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- When ""wif"" is combined with ""dax"", another word whose meaning is constant (""dax"" -> ""green""), it results in ""red green"" when in sequence and the same sequence is observed when their positions are switched, again supporting that ""wif"" means ""red"".

Therefore, based on the given examples, the rule appears to be:

wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow"" regardless of its position within the input sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's consider the sequence of the inputs and outputs.

1. In the first example, ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue green green."" Here the appearance of ""bluf"" coincides with the color green.
2. In the second example, ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" Notice that there is no green despite ""bluf"" being in the input, which challenges the initial hypothesis that ""bluf"" might mean green.
3. In the third example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow."" The term ""bluf"" does not introduce a new color.
4. In the fourth example, ""lug wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue blue."" Again, ""bluf"" doesn't add a new color but instead repeats blue.
5. In the fifth example, ""lug bluf zup"" translates to ""blue blue yellow."" ""Bluf"" corresponds to blue here as well.

Considering ""bluf"" causes a repetition of the most recent color mentioned before it:

Rule: ""bluf"" causes the previous color mentioned to be repeated. If ""bluf"" is the first word, then it does not result in an output.
Observing the provided examples, the output colors seem to correspond to the input words as follows:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
  
Further examination of the outputs indicates that the number of colored outputs for each input word is equal to the number of letters in the input word:

- dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue (dax has 3 letters -> 1 green; lug has 3 letters -> 3 blues)
- wif walm -> red red red (wif has 3 letters -> 3 reds)
- wif walm dax -> red red red green (wif has 3 letters -> 3 reds; dax has 3 letters -> 1 green)
- lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue (lug has 3 letters -> 3 blues; bluf has 4 letters, but it does not seem to affect the output; dax has 3 letters -> 1 green; zup has 3 letters -> 3 yellows; the repeated lug -> 1 blue)
- wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> red red red green yellow red blue blue blue (repeating patterns from previous examples, where wif yields 3 reds, dax yields 1 green, zup yields 3 yellows, and lug yields blue outputs)

It looks like ""walm"" as an input word simply restates the colors corresponding to the word that directly precedes it. Using the examples, when ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" you get three reds, and when it follows ""lug,"" you get as many blues as the prior ""lug"" word denotes. 

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be: Repeat the color denoted by the word immediately preceding ""walm,"" with the quantity being equal to the number of letters in the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color denoted by the previous word, with the quantity based on the number of letters in the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,131
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the output, regardless of its position or the surrounding words in the input.
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in all given examples, regardless of its position in the sequence or the context provided by other words.
wif -> red

Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" we should look for patterns in the input and output sequences. Here's a simplified analysis based on the given examples:

1. When ""dax zup"" is the input, the output is ""green yellow."" ""Dax"" is not present in any other example, so we cannot directly deduce what ""zup"" means from this example alone. However, we can tentatively associate ""zup"" with the output ""yellow,"" assuming ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

2. When ""zup"" is followed by ""walm wif,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow red."" In the next example, ""zup wif"" alone generates ""yellow red."" This suggests that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red,"" and each occurrence of ""walm"" adds an additional ""yellow"" before ""red.""

3. The input ""zup lug walm wif walm"" results in ""yellow blue blue blue red red red."" This indicates that ""lug"" might correspond to ""blue,"" and it seems that each ""walm"" not only adds a ""yellow"" before ""red"" but also adds an extra ""blue"" after ""lug"" and an extra ""red"" after ""wif.""

4. The last example provided is identical to the second one and yields the same output, reinforcing the previously identified patterns.

Based on these observations, we can infer the following provisional rules:

- ""zup"" on its own corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""walm"" before ""wif"" results in an extra ""yellow"" for each ""walm"" and an extra ""red"" after ""wif.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and seems to increase the count of the subsequent color words in the sequence.

Rule:
zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following patterns:

- Each occurrence of ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- The words preceding and following ""bluf"" (if any) are converted into a color based on another rule, not necessarily directly related to the meaning of ""bluf.""

It seems the word preceding ""bluf"" determines the color we repeat. When ""bluf"" appears, we repeat the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. For example, ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" translates to ""red blue blue red yellow,"" showing that the word before ""bluf"" (""lug"") corresponds to ""blue,"" and hence we get two instances of ""blue."" Similarly, in ""dax bluf zup,"" the word before ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and we see that ""bluf"" translates to a repeated ""green.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

bluf -> the color that corresponds to the preceding word, repeated once.

So, if we were to write it according to your instructions, it would be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it.
Examining the input and output pairs suggests that the output is a sequence of colors where each color seems to correspond to a specific word in the input. Additionally, it seems that the word ""walm"" is associated with a repetition of the color linked to the previous word in the input.

Let's break down the examples:

1. Input: ""wif walm zup walm""
   Output: ""red red red yellow yellow yellow""
   Here, ""wif"" is associated with red, and ""zup"" with yellow. ""Walm"" after ""wif"" leads to two more repetitions of red. ""Walm"" after ""zup"" leads to two more repetitions of yellow.

2. Input: ""zup wif walm""
   Output: ""yellow red red red""
   Here again, ""zup"" is associated with yellow, ""wif"" with red, and following ""wif"" with ""walm"" leads to two additional repetitions of red.

3. Input: ""zup walm lug zup wif dax""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green""
   ""Zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" repeating yellow twice more. ""Lug"" is associated with blue. Then ""zup"" gives us another yellow, ""wif"" red, and ""dax"" green.

4. Input: ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf""
   Output: ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""
   We see the pattern continue with ""lug"" yielding blue, ""zup"" yellow, and ""walm"" repeating it two more times. ""Dax"" gives green, ""wif"" red, and ""bluf"" (a new word) yields another red.

5. Input: ""dax walm lug""
   Output: ""green green green blue""
   Here, ""dax"" is associated with green, followed by ""walm,"" which gives us two more greens. ""Lug"" gives blue.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to repeat twice more in the output sequence.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Causes the repetition of the color linked to the preceding word two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,132
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""lug"" can be deduced as follows:

lug -> blue

Rule: Each occurrence of the word ""lug"" in the input corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in each provided example.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a color in the output. The repetitions of the nonce words and their respective outputs allow us to deduce that:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" when preceded by ""wif"" and corresponds to ""yellow"" otherwise
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"" (appears in a sequence with ""zup"" which is known to correspond to ""yellow"")

With ""wif"" appearing at the beginning of a sequence or as a single input, the output is consistently ""red"". However, with the word ""bluf"" we see an inconsistency: it results in ""yellow"" in the first example, but ""red"" in the second example when it follows ""wif"". This suggests that ""wif"" might influence the following word. But since ""dax"" after ""wif"" still results in ""green"", the rule may specifically apply to ""bluf"" following ""wif"".

In all instances, regardless of position, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""zup"", let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairings:

1. Input: ""zup lug walm wif walm"" 
   Output: ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue red red""
   - ""zup"" lands at the beginning, corresponding to ""yellow""

2. Input: ""wif zup""
   Output: ""red yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""zup"" at the end corresponds to ""yellow""

3. Input: ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup""
   Output: ""yellow yellow red green red yellow""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" at both the beginning and the end corresponds to ""yellow""

4. Input: ""lug bluf zup""
   Output: ""blue blue yellow""
   - The placement of ""zup"" at the end corresponds to ""yellow""

5. Input: ""lug wif zup wif""
   Output: ""blue red yellow red""
   - Here ""zup"" is sandwiched between ""wif"" corresponding to ""red,"" but ""wif zup"" does not yield ""red yellow"" as one might expect from example 2. This suggests placement matters, and that ""zup"" may consistently be ""yellow"" regardless of placement.

Given these observations, it appears that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the given examples, we can try to induce the rule for the nonce word ""bluf.""

In the first example, ""bluf"" appears at the end after a repetitive sequence of ""zup lug,"" and the corresponding output ends with two ""yellow."" Note that every other pair of ""zup lug"" correlates to ""yellow blue.""

In the second example, ""bluf"" appears after a ""zup"" and the corresponding output is ""yellow yellow,"" while ""lug"" alone corresponds to ""blue.""

In the third example, ""bluf"" is preceded by three ""wif"" and the output sequence is followed by two ""red."" So, in this case, ""bluf"" may represent a double of the color following ""wif"" which is ""green."" So it seems to double the previous color again.

In the fourth example, ""bluf"" precedes ""dax"" and the color sequence is ""blue blue."" Following this, ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" with ""yellow,"" but in the color sequence, there are two ""blue"" instead of just one following ""bluf.""

In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is between ""dax"" and ""zup"" and the output sequence is ""green green yellow."" Here, it seems like ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" before proceeding to the next color.

From these examples, it appears that ""bluf"" might represent a rule where ""bluf"" causes the next word's corresponding color to be repeated or doubled.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the following word.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" produces a repetition of the color output that immediately precedes it. The number of repetitions seems to be identical to the number of times ""walm"" is mentioned consecutively. To break this down:

- In the first example, ""lug walm wif"" results in ""blue blue blue red"". The word ""lug"" yields a ""blue"", and since ""walm"" follows, it repeats ""blue"" once before moving on to the next color, which is ""red"" for ""wif"".

- The second example, ""lug wif dax zup walm"", outputs ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow"". Here ""zup"" yields a ""yellow"", and ""walm"" following it repeats ""yellow"" for as many times as it is mentioned (once in this instance).

- In the third example, ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"". ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", followed by ""walm"", which repeats the ""yellow"" twice consecutively. After that, ""lug"" transitions to ""blue"", and ""wif"" to ""red"". ""Bluf"" is not defined, but based on the pattern, it seems reasonable to deduce that it could be similar to ""wif"", therefore yielding ""red"".

- The fourth example has the sequence ""dax zup walm wif walm"" with the output ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red"". ""Dax"" is ""green"", and ""zup"" is ""yellow"". The first ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"". The ""wif"" switches the color to ""red"", and the final ""walm"" again repeats the color ""red"" thrice.

- In the last example, ""zup wif walm"", the output is ""yellow red red red"". This follows the same rule; ""zup"" yields ""yellow"" and ""wif"" changes it to ""red"". The ""walm"" then repeats the color ""red"" three times.

Based on these observations, the rule is:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color immediately preceding it as many times as ""walm"" is mentioned consecutively.

- The word ""lug"" always corresponds to the output ""blue"".

Here is how ""lug"" corresponds to the output across the provided examples:

1. Input: ""lug"" -> Output: ""blue""
2. Input: ""dax lug wif"" -> Output: ""green blue red""
3. Input: ""dax lug dax lug walm"" -> Output: ""green blue green blue blue blue""
4. Input: ""wif dax wif lug wif"" -> Output: ""red green red blue red""
5. Input: ""zup dax walm lug wif"" -> Output: ""yellow green green green blue red""

No matter the surrounding context, the word ""lug"" is consistently translated to ""blue"", and the presence of other words in the input does not appear to change this output.

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each unique word in the input corresponds to a unique color in the output. The color patterns match in a one-to-one relationship with the word patterns. Specifically, the word ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red."" Therefore, the rule can be deduced as:

Rule: wif -> red
Looking at the examples provided:

1. lug walm zup wif -> blue blue yellow red
2. zup -> yellow
3. dax zup -> green yellow
4. dax wif zup -> green red yellow
5. dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

From these inputs and outputs, we can see that ""zup"" always translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the string or the words that precede or follow it. The presence of other words changes the rest of the output, but the word ""zup"" consistently results in the output ""yellow.""

Thus, the rule can be stated as: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to take on the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""lug bluf"" maps to ""blue blue."" This indicates that ""bluf"" took on the color associated with ""lug,"" which is blue.
- In the second example, ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" took the color of ""dax,"" which is green.
- The third example, ""wif bluf,"" leads to ""red red,"" again showing that ""bluf"" adopts the color of ""wif,"" which is red.
- The fourth example, ""lug bluf,"" turns into ""blue blue,"" maintaining the pattern that ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word.
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" confirming the previous observations.

There's no instance where ""bluf"" is the first word, so based on the given data, we cannot determine what color ""bluf"" would represent in that position.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" means the same color as the word before it. If ""bluf"" comes after ""lug,"" it means blue; if it comes after ""dax,"" it means green; if it comes after ""wif,"" it means red.

Expressed as a formula:

bluf -> meaning of the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the meaning assigned to the word ""walm"" seems to be closely tied to the word that comes immediately before it. It looks like ""walm"" takes the color associated with the preceding word and repeats it three times. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue.""
- In the second and fourth examples, ""lug walm"" again outputs ""blue blue blue.""
- In the third and fifth examples, ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green.""

The only other word that appears before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" which correlates with ""blue,"" and ""dax,"" which correlates with ""green."" There are no conflicting examples to this pattern.

Rule:
walm -> meaning. When walm is preceded by a word, it repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug
    ",Output: green blue,green blue,True,134
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
Based on the examples provided, the following deductions can be made:

- In the first example, ""wif dax lug"" corresponds to ""red green blue"". Given that ""dax"" stands alone, we could reasonably speculate at this point that ""dax"" might correspond to ""green"".
- In the second example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", which supports our initial speculation from the first example.
- In the third example, ""lug dax walm"" translates to ""blue green green green"". It could be that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""walm"" corresponds to repeating ""green"", and ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green"".
- The fourth example, ""dax wif zup dax"", results in ""green red yellow green"". Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"", as inferred from previous examples, further substantiating our belief that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""zup walm dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green"". ""Zup"" and ""walm"" both resulted in ""yellow"" outputs, with ""dax"" at the end corresponding to ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"". Here's the breakdown:

- In examples 1 and 2, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" while the other words have their own color associations (""bluf"" to ""blue"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"").
- In example 3, ""wif"" is again translated as ""red"", fitting the pattern of the other words and their corresponding color outputs.
- In example 4, despite the introduction of a new word ""dax"" corresponding to ""green"", ""wif"" retains its association with ""red"".
- Example 5 further confirms this pattern with ""wif"" remaining consistent with ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the patterns observed in the provided examples, each nonce word appears to correspond to a specific color in the output:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- walm -> yellow
- dax -> green
- wif -> red

When the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the subsequent word in the output is not a direct color word but instead seems to indicate the repetition of the color word that would correspond to the next nonce word if ""bluf"" were not present. For example, in the first input, ""bluf"" precedes the ""lug"" which is blue, and the output is ""red red,"" implying that ""bluf"" causes the preceding color (red) to be repeated before continuing with the expected sequence of colors.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it causes a repetition of the color corresponding to the preceding word. If we apply this rule to the examples, we get the following:

1. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red), resulting in ""red red.""

2. Input: wif bluf lug
   Output: red red blue
   ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red), resulting in ""red red.""

3. Input: dax bluf wif zup
   Output: green green red yellow
   ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (green), resulting in ""green green.""

4. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red), resulting in ""red red.""

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), resulting in ""yellow yellow.""

Hence, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> Causes the output to repeat the color that corresponds to the word directly preceding ""bluf.""

Using this definition, ""bluf"" does not directly represent a color itself, but instead a rule for the transformation of colors in a sequence.
From the given examples, we can see that the word ""walm"" is being translated into a sequence of colored words in the Output. Here are the observations from each input-output pair:

1. ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow"". ""zup"" is represented by a single ""yellow"" and ""walm"" is followed by a sequence of two more ""yellow"".

2. ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" corresponds to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"". ""wif"" is ""red"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""bluf"" is ""blue"", and ""lug"" is a repeated ""blue"". The word ""walm"" seems to be repeating the color of the word just before it, two additional times, hence ""blue blue blue"".

3. ""zup walm dax"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow green"". The presence of ""walm"" after ""zup"" again results in two additional ""yellow"" before ""dax"", which is ""green"".

4. ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red"". The ""walm"" doubles the ""red"" that corresponds to ""wif"".

5. ""dax wif walm"" corresponds to ""green red red red"". ""dax"" is ""green"", ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" repeats the ""red"" color of ""wif"" two more times.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color word that precedes it to be repeated two additional times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color word two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug
    ",Output: green blue,green blue,True,135
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. 

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
dax -> green. 

Rule: The nonce word 'dax' is consistently translated to the color 'green'.
From the examples provided, we can see that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the appearance of a specific color in the output. Each instance of ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red,"" regardless of its position within the input string or what other words are present.

Here's the breakdown according to the examples:

- ""dax walm wif walm zup"" outputs ""green green green red red red yellow,"" and the occurrence of ""wif"" results in the first ""red.""
- ""wif lug walm"" outputs ""red blue blue blue,"" with ""wif"" being the first word and resulting in the first ""red.""
- ""wif lug wif"" outputs ""red blue red,"" with both instances of ""wif"" yielding ""red.""
- ""lug wif walm"" outputs ""blue red red red,"" with ""wif"" resulting in ""red"" after the initial ""blue.""
- The single word ""wif"" outputs ""red.""

Based on these examples, the rule can be articulated as:

Rule: wif -> red. Wif corresponds to the color red in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we can observe that the output is a sequence of colors corresponding to the input containing both nonce words and actual color names. The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"" in every example given.

Rule: zup -> yellow

From the provided examples, we can induce a rule for the meaning of the word ""bluf."" Here is the analysis of each input-output pair:

1. Input: ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" - Output: ""yellow yellow red green red yellow""
2. Input: ""zup dax bluf"" - Output: ""yellow green green""
3. Input: ""zup dax bluf"" - Output: ""yellow green green"" (This is the same as example 2)
4. Input: ""dax bluf"" - Output: ""green green""
5. Input: ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" - Output: ""red yellow yellow red green""

Breaking it down, we have three words ""zup"", ""dax"", and ""wif"" that correspond to ""yellow"", ""green"", and ""red"" respectively. ""Bluf"" is the variable word that we need to determine meaning for.

From examples 1 and 5, we can observe that ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" and ""wif"" leading to ""yellow"" and ""red"" respectively. In examples 2, 3, and 4, ""bluf"" directly follows ""dax"" and results in ""green.""

With these patterns in mind, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the color of the preceding word.
Observing the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, we can look for patterns to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word 'walm'.

Examining each input-output pair:

1. Input: ""zup walm"" | Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
2. Input: ""dax wif walm"" | Output: ""green red red red""
3. Input: ""dax walm zup lug dax"" | Output: ""green green green yellow blue green""
4. Input: ""dax wif walm lug zup"" | Output: ""green red red red blue yellow""
5. Input: ""zup lug walm wif dax"" | Output: ""yellow blue blue blue red green""

It seems that each non-walm word translates to a specific color:

- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""

Now, let's look for patterns involving 'walm':

1. In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and results in two additional ""yellow"" outputs.
2. In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and results in three additional ""red"" outputs.
3. In the third and fourth examples, ""walm"" leads to repeating the color of the word right before it three times.
4. In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in three additional ""blue"" outputs.

Based on these observations:

Rule: 'walm' -> meaning: The word 'walm' causes the next output to be three repetitions of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes 'walm'.

In other words: When 'walm' is present in the input, it multiplies the color of the preceding word by three in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,136
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" always translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at the Output associated with the Input in which ""dax"" appears:

1. ""lug dax wif lug"" corresponds to ""blue green red blue."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" Given that ""dax"" is surrounded by known terms, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

2. ""dax walm wif zup"" corresponds to ""green green green red yellow."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" ""Walm"" appears twice before ""wif"" and both times it is ""green."" ""Dax"" appears at the beginning and is also ""green.""

3. ""zup lug dax"" corresponds to ""yellow blue green."" We know ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" ""Dax"" is the only unknown, which corresponds to ""green.""

4. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" corresponds to ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow."" ""Lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" The word ""walm"" repeats after ""zup"" and corresponds to ""yellow."" Here, ""dax"" precedes ""zup"" and its corresponding color is ""green.""

5. ""dax walm wif walm zup"" corresponds to ""green green green red red red yellow."" ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" and before ""wif"" with a color of ""green."" ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" ""Dax"" precedes ""walm"" and has a matching color of ""green.""

In every instance, regardless of its position, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, each instance of ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""bluf,"" ""zup,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to a specific color output. The specific color each word translates to is consistent across all provided examples:

- Every instance of ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
- Every instance of ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- The only instance of ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- Every instance of ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- Every instance of ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- Every instance of ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Therefore, based on the provided examples:

Rule: wif -> ""red""
Based on the provided examples, we can infer a consistent pattern regarding the colour that corresponds to each word, including the nonce word ""zup"". It seems that each word translates to a specific colour:

- Every instance of ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- ""Lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- ""Bluf"" corresponds to another ""yellow"".
- ""Walm"" seems to introduce a repeated pattern of ""red"", as evidenced by ""walm"" corresponding to ""red red red"".

This leads to a straightforward rule induction:

zup -> ""yellow""

Rule: Each nonce word is associated with a specific colour, and in the case of ""zup"", it always means ""yellow"". Additionally, certain words might introduce repetition of a colour, such as ""walm"" leading to a triplicate ""red"".
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color. When we see the output sequence, each instance of ""bluf"" is translated into a color. However, its translation seems to vary across the examples, suggesting that the meaning of ""bluf"" is context-dependent.

From the given examples, let's observe:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" appears after ""zup lug zup lug zup,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow."" The sequence before it is alternating colors following the pattern ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""red."" Before ""bluf,"" ""lug"" translated to ""blue."" After ""bluf,"" ""lug"" still translates to ""blue,"" but ""wif"" changes from ""red"" to ""red.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" translating to ""yellow,"" and before ""dax,"" which translates to ""green."" Here, ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"" (which translates to ""red"") and before ""lug"" (which translates to ""blue"") but translates to ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" appears twice: once after ""dax"" (green) and ""zup"" (yellow), where ""bluf"" translates to ""green""; and the second time after ""wif"" (red) and ""zup"" (yellow), where ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""

By analysing the patterns:

- ""bluf"" translates to yellow when following ""zup"" (yellow).
- ""bluf"" translates to red when following ""wif"" (red).
- ""bluf"" translates to green when following ""dax"" (green).

Based on these observations, it seems like the rule for ""bluf"" is that it takes on the color of the word preceding it.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> takes on the color of the word immediately before it.
Based on the examples provided where the word ""walm"" appears and the output it corresponds to, it seems that ""walm"" is an instruction to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it in the sequence. For instance:

1. In ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"", ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red"". Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and after ""walm"" is introduced, ""yellow"" is repeated until a new color word appears (""dax"" corresponding to ""green"").

2. In ""lug walm"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and the output is ""blue blue blue"", showing that ""walm"" caused a repetition of ""blue"".

3. In ""zup dax lug walm zup"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and after ""lug"" we see ""walm"" which results in ""blue"" being repeated until a new color ""zup"" (yellow) appears.

4. In ""zup wif dax walm"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and following ""walm"" we see ""green"" being repeated.

5. In ""zup lug walm"", after ""lug"" (""blue""), ""walm"" leads to the repetition of ""blue"".

So, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the outputs provided.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" I will look at the patterns in the given examples, correlating the presence of ""dax"" and other words to the output colors. Here's how the input words seem to map to output colors based on the provided examples:

1. The input ""dax"" always maps to the output ""green."" 
2. The input ""lug"" always maps to the output ""blue.""
3. The input ""wif"" seems to map to the output ""red,"" based on its presence in the third and fifth examples.
4. The input ""bluf"" correlates with ""yellow"" in the last example; however, in the third example, it seems to be preceded by ""wif,"" which corresponds with the occurrence of two ""green"" outputs, making the meaning of ""bluf"" a bit unclear.

By looking at these patterns, we can determine the probable meaning of each of the input words:

dax -> green
lug -> blue
wif -> red
zup -> yellow (from the last example, assuming one-to-one correspondence between new input and output)
bluf -> potentially yellow, but the rules seem incongruous unless the input ""wif"" modifies the color output in some way

Therefore, the rule to deduce the meaning of ""dax"" is quite straightforward:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
bluf -> yellow

Rule: The word ""bluf"" in the input consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Rule: ""walm"" means to repeat the color corresponding to the previous non-walm word the number of times walm appears consecutively.

""walm"" -> repeat the previously mentioned color.

For example:

""zup lug walm wif walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red red red"" because ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and there is one ""walm"" following it, so we repeat blue once, then ""wif"" corresponds to red and there is one ""walm"" after, so we repeat red once.

""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and there is one ""walm"" following it, which makes us repeat yellow two more times, for a total of three yellows.

""zup walm wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow red"" follows the rule above, and adds a single ""wif"" at the end, which corresponds to red.

""wif walm dax"" -> ""red red red green"" because ""wif"" corresponds to red, followed by one ""walm,"" so we repeat red two more times, and then ""dax"" corresponds to green.

""zup bluf lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"" because ""bluf"" corresponds to yellow (derived from combining the outputs from ""zup"" and ""bluf""), ""lug"" corresponds to blue (this output is unique), another ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow and then one ""walm,"" which makes us repeat yellow two more times for the two consecutive ""zup.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the given examples. Each occurrence of ""lug"" in the inputs is associated with the color ""blue"" in the outputs, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be related to the sequence of words and their associated colors. To decode the meaning of the nonce word 'dax', let's examine the examples provided for consistent patterns.

1. (wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif) maps to (red red green green red red red blue red)
2. (dax wif) maps to (green red)
3. (wif dax bluf) maps to (red green green)
4. (wif dax wif) maps to (red green red)
5. (dax bluf lug wif) maps to (green green blue red)

Looking at the examples:

- Every 'wif' is translated as 'red', and each 'bluf' as 'green', except when preceded by 'dax'.
- When a word follows 'dax', it's color outputs differently than its standard color association (e.g., a 'bluf' following 'dax' in the first example is 'green' instead of its standard 'blue').
- 'dax' itself translates to 'green'.

The rule seems to be that 'dax' changes the color association of the following word to 'green', and 'dax' itself is associated with the color 'green'. 

So the rule is: dax -> changes the following word's color output to green, and represents the color green itself.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in the output. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" is as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> meaning. Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup"" and ""blue"" when it follows ""lug"" or ""dax"". If ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", it translates to ""red"".
From the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color that precedes it. In each occurrence, the word preceding ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output. Here are the translations based on the examples:

- lug walm -> blue blue blue (lug translates to blue)
- dax walm wif -> green green green red (dax translates to green, wif translates to red)
- dax walm wif zup -> green green green red yellow (zup translates to yellow)
- dax zup dax walm -> green yellow green green green (the presence of ""dax walm"" at the end repeats the ""green"" three times)
- dax walm -> green green green (dax translates to green)

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be: The word ""walm"" causes the color word that precedes it to be outputted three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the preceding color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

The consistent pattern from the examples given is that whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding output. There are no examples to suggest that ""lug"" means anything other than ""blue"" in this context.
dax -> green

Rule: Based on the provided examples, ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" every time it appears. There is no variation in the output that would indicate ""wif"" has a different meaning in different contexts. Therefore, the rule seems to be straightforward:

wif -> red

Rule: In the given context, the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Each occurrence of the word ""zup"" within the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output. Here is how the rule is applied in the examples:

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red
Rule: zup -> ""yellow""

Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
Rule: zup -> ""yellow""

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""

Input: dax zup
Output: green yellow
Rule: zup -> ""yellow""

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look at the patterns surrounding its occurrence and the corresponding output colors. Let's analyze the examples:

1. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
   Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow

2. Input: zup bluf wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow red red

3. Input: dax bluf zup
   Output: green green yellow

4. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red

5. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
   Output: blue red green green red blue

Based on these examples, it appears that ""bluf"" results in the color that is the same as the preceding word. Here's how we can infer that:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the color red is repeated.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows both ""zup"" and ""wif,"" and the color red is repeated after both.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the color green is repeated.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the color red is repeated.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the color green is repeated.

Therefore, the rule we can induce is:

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the relation between the input and the output.

1. In the first and second examples, ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue."" It seems ""lug"" corresponds to a single ""blue,"" and the addition of ""walm"" leads to two more ""blue"" outputs.
   
2. In the third example, ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red."" In this instance, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the addition of ""walm"" again results in two more of the same color.

3. In the fourth example, ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" leads to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red."" Here, we see ""lug"" leading to ""blue,"" ""zup"" leading to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" leading to ""red"" again. When ""walm"" is added after ""lug,"" it results in two more ""blue.""

4. In the fifth example, ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" corresponds to ""green blue blue blue green red red green."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red"" once more. ""walm"" following ""lug"" yields two extra ""blue"" again.

From these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" repeats the color output of the word immediately before it two more times.

Rule: walm -> ""Repeat the color output of the word immediately before it two more times.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in these examples. Every time ""lug"" appears in the input, it is translated into ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, it seems the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green"". When ""dax"" appears alone, the output is simply ""green"". When ""dax"" is preceded by ""wif"", the output is ""red green"". When ""dax"" is followed by ""wif walm"", the output is ""green"" followed by ""red red red"". ""Wif"" and ""walm"" seem to correlate with ""red"", but in this task, we need to focus on ""dax"":

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"".
Based on the examples provided:

- ""wif dax lug dax"" translates to ""red green blue green"", which means ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""dax zup wif"" translates to ""green yellow red,"" with ""wif"" again corresponding to ""red.""
- ""wif"" on its own consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""lug zup dax wif"" translates to ""blue yellow green red,"" with ""wif"" at the end corresponding to ""red.""

The rule that can be deduced from all these examples is as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" irrespective of its placement within the sequence of words.
Based on the examples provided where the input and output are placed side by side, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" when following the word ""zup,"" and to the color ""blue"" when following the word ""lug."" Considering these patterns, I can propose the following rule:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" changes color based on its preceding word. When preceded by ""zup,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow,"" and when preceded by ""lug,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""blue."" There is not enough information to determine its meaning when it follows other words or when it appears alone, as it is not directly followed by another word in any example given. However, considering that in every instance except when preceded by ""zup,"" ""bluf"" has been translated to ""blue,"" it may be an acceptable assumption until further examples prove otherwise.

Considering this, we could write the rule as:
bluf -> meaning changes based on the context. Following ""zup"" it means ""yellow,"" following ""lug"" it means ""blue,"" and in other unknown contexts, it may default to ""blue"" based on available data.
Based on the examples provided, we can notice a pattern in which the word ""walm"" seems to produce an output of multiple ""yellow"". However, the count of ""yellow"" in the output seems to be affected by the words that precede ""walm"". To deduce the rule, we should look at the number of times ""yellow"" appears and what precedes ""walm"":

1. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"": ""walm"" follows a single ""zup"", resulting in ""yellow"" repeated three times.
2. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red"": ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and is preceded by ""zup"". The presence of ""wif"" somehow turns ""yellow"" into ""red"", but ""walm"" still adds three repetitions to the output.
3. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"": Here, ""walm"" follows two instances of ""zup"" separated by other words, yet the output is ""yellow"" three times from the point ""walm"" is mentioned.
4. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" -> ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue"": Even when ""walm"" is in the middle of the sequence, the three ""yellow"" only starts after ""walm"" appears.
5. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red"": Again, right after ""walm"", three ""reds"" appear, preceded by ""zup"" and ""bluf"".

The common factor is the repetition of ""yellow"" three times immediately after ""walm"" is mentioned, regardless of what precedes it. The influence of other words like ""wif"" seems to change the color in the sequence but not the repetition effect caused by ""walm"". Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be concluded as:

Rule: ""walm"" means to repeat the color ""yellow"" three times starting from the point where ""walm"" is mentioned in the sequence, regardless of the preceding words.

walm -> meaning: ""Repeat the word 'yellow' three times in the output, starting from the point 'walm' appears in the input.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Here's the observed pattern:

- wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green (dax corresponds to the first green)
- dax -> green (dax solely corresponds to green)
- lug zup dax lug dax -> blue yellow green blue green (dax corresponds to green both times it appears)
- lug dax walm wif -> blue green green green red (dax corresponds to the first green)
- zup lug zup dax -> yellow blue yellow green (dax corresponds to the single green)

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" 

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" The evidence for this comes from each example where ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is the color that the word that follows it represents. If ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" it represents red; if followed by ""lug,"" it represents blue; if followed by ""dax,"" it represents green; if followed by ""zup,"" it represents yellow. When ""bluf"" appears without a following word, it defaults to duplicating the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color signified by the word that follows it, or duplicates the color of the preceding word if no word follows.
From the given examples, we can try to induce the meaning or rule for the word ""walm.""

- In every example, the output contains a sequence of colors that appear to correspond to input noncolors words.
- When ""walm"" is present in the input, a sequence of the same color appears in the output, repeating as many times as the position of ""walm"" within the input sequence.
    - In example 1, ""walm"" is in position 4, and ""blue"" repeats four times in the output.
    - In example 2, ""walm"" is in position 5, and ""yellow"" repeats three times in the output following ""walm.""
    - In example 3, ""walm"" is last which is position 5, and ""red"" is repeated three times following ""walm.""
    - In example 4, ""walm"" is in position 2, and ""yellow"" repeats twice in the output.
    - In example 5, ""walm"" is in position 2, and ""blue"" repeats three times in the output.

Given this pattern, ""walm"" seems to cause the color corresponding to the preceding noncolor word to repeat a number of times equal to the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence minus one (since the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" appears once before the sequence begins).

Rule: walm -> Causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to repeat in the output, with the count being equal to the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence minus one.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can analyze each instance where ""lug"" appears and the corresponding output to deduce its meaning:

1. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red
2. lug -> blue
3. lug walm -> blue blue blue
4. lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow
5. lug -> blue

From these examples, we can see that every occurrence of ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue."" There is no instance where ""lug"" leads to a different output. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

lug -> meaning. Meaning: ""blue"".
Given the examples provided, each nonce word seems to correspond to a specific color. Here's how the colors map to the words based on the given input-output pairs:

- dax -> green
- walm -> green
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow

Rule: dax means green.
Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color in the output. The following associations can be made:

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- walm -> green (given that it is repeated in sequence three times suggesting repetition might not alter its associated output)

So, when ""wif"" appears in the input, the output is always ""red."" There doesn't appear to be a contextual change to this rule based on the examples given. Other words also seem to have a one-to-one correspondence with colors.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"". Here is the rule induction based on each example correlating the input with the output:

- ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" correlates to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green"", where ""zup"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""bluf,"" both translating to ""yellow.""
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" correlates to ""yellow yellow red red red"", where ""zup"" directly precedes ""bluf"" which translates to ""yellow.""
- ""zup dax wif zup"" correlates to ""yellow green red yellow"", showing that both instances of ""zup"" translate to ""yellow,"" irrespective of their position.
- ""wif zup"" correlates to ""red yellow,"" directly translating ""zup"" to ""yellow"" following ""wif.""
- ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" correlates to ""yellow yellow red blue green"", with ""zup"" directly preceding ""bluf"" and ""wif,"" translating to ""yellow"" in both instances.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Observing the examples given, we can deduce the following:

- In examples where ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (examples 1, 3, and 5), the output for ""bluf"" is ""red.""
- In examples where ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (example 2), the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue.""
- In example 4 where ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""

The pattern seems to be that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" indicates the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. 

Here's the pattern according to the examples:

1. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug → blue blue red blue red red red blue
   The ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" so ""walm"" causes repetition of the color ""red.""

2. dax walm lug → green green green blue
   The ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" so ""walm"" causes repetition of the color ""green.""

3. zup walm dax zup dax wif → yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
   The ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""walm"" causes repetition of the color ""yellow.""

4. wif walm → red red red
   The ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" so ""walm"" causes repetition of the color ""red.""

5. lug walm → blue blue blue
   The ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""walm"" causes repetition of the color ""blue.""

Therefore, ""walm"" is a function that repeats the color associated with the word that comes before it.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color mentioned before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the output. The position of ""lug"" within the input string does not affect its meaning, as no matter where it appears, it always corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.

Rule: lug -> ""blue""
Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following:

- In the first example, ""zup dax wif"" corresponds to ""yellow green red"". Each word appears to correspond to a specific color.
- In the second example, ""dax lug wif"" corresponds to ""green blue red"". ""Dax"" appears again, and it corresponds to the color ""green"".
- The third example, which is just ""dax"", produces the output of ""green"", reinforcing the link between the word ""dax"" and the color.
- The fourth and fifth examples are identical, ""wif walm dax zup"", and both correspond to ""red red red green yellow"", which gives us a consistent color output for each word, where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green.
Analyzing the given examples where the word ""wif"" occurs and the corresponding outputs:

- Example 1: lug wif dax bluf wif lug -> blue red green green red blue
- Example 2: dax wif -> green red
- Example 3: lug dax zup lug wif -> blue green yellow blue red
- Example 4: wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> red green red red yellow red
- Example 5: zup wif -> yellow red

Observing the inputs and outputs, 'wif' appears to be prefixed or suffixed with a color name to yield the corresponding complementary color in the output:

- Blue's complementary color is red (lug -> blue, wif lug -> red blue)
- Green's complementary color is red (dax -> green, wif dax or dax wif -> red)
- Yellow's complementary color is red (zup -> yellow, zup wif -> yellow red)

It seems that ""wif"" indicates the action of producing the complementary color red, regardless of the color it is associated with. 

Based on this recurring pattern, the rule can be inferred as:

Rule: ""wif"" represents the color red when placed either before or after another color name.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. Thus, the rule appears to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the input and output pairs provided, we can deduce that each nonce word corresponds to a color. The word ""bluf"" correlates with a specific color in each instance. To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the examples.

- In every instance where ""bluf"" appears, the output is ""red"" except for the position of the word ""bluf"" itself. There, it consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- However, in the last example, ""bluf"" directly follows ""wif,"" similar to the first input, but the output sequence includes two ""reds"" before a ""blue."" This indicates that ""bluf"" does not represent ""yellow."" 

The inconsistency arises because it appears that two rules might be at play here: one regarding the position of ""bluf"" and potentially another one related to the words before and after ""bluf."" Before making a final judgment on the rule for ""bluf,"" let's revisit each instance, isolating ""bluf"":

1. wif bluf lug -> red red blue
2. wif bluf zup -> red red yellow
3. zup bluf wif dax lug -> yellow yellow red green blue
4. dax zup lug zup bluf -> green yellow blue yellow yellow
5. lug wif bluf lug wif -> blue red red blue red

Since ""bluf"" immediately follows ""wif"" in the first and second example, we know that ""wif"" means ""red."" In the third, fourth, and fifth examples, ""bluf"" follows a different word each time and corresponds to the output ""yellow"" only once, and a different color each other time. 

The challenge here is that the output after ""bluf"" also changes, indicating the meaning of ""bluf"" may not be static. Since ""bluf"" outputs different colors in different contexts, it suggests that the word ""bluf"" might be acting as a modifier or condition for determining the color of the adjacent words rather than representing a color itself.

Given the examples, one possible rule is:

- The word following ""bluf"" reverses the order of color mapping compared to previous word-color mappings.

To test this rule, we can look at the instances where ""bluf"" is followed by a word whose color output we know from another context:

- The first and second examples don't showcase this, as ""lug"" following ""bluf"" outputs ""blue,"" which doesn't appear to reverse anything.
- In the third example, ""wif"" after ""bluf"" outputs ""red,"" breaking the potential reversal pattern, since ""wif"" also outputs ""red"" when preceding ""bluf.""
- In the fourth example, there's no word preceding ""bluf"" from which we can infer a reversal.
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" appears both before and after ""bluf,"" giving the same output, ""blue,"" which doesn't support the reversal rule.

Thus, with the provided examples, the rule that ""bluf"" causes the following word to reverse its normal color output doesn't hold.

Considering the inconsistencies and complexity, the rule for ""bluf"" is not sufficiently clear from the given examples. Determining an exact rule for ""bluf"" requires additional input examples or clarification about how ""bluf"" systematically affects the color mappings of surrounding words.
From the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the word ""walm"" by looking at the patterns and differences in input and output.

In every output, the presence of ""walm"" leads to a repetition:

1. ""zup lug walm"" => ""yellow blue blue blue""
2. ""lug walm zup wif"" => ""blue blue blue yellow red""
3. ""wif walm"" => ""red red red""
4. ""zup walm dax lug"" => ""yellow yellow yellow green blue""
5. ""lug walm wif lug"" => ""blue blue blue red blue""

For each occurrence of ""walm,"" the color immediately preceding it is repeated multiple times in the output. For example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" in example 1, and the output repeats ""blue"" three times after the first appearance. Similarly, in example 5, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and again ""blue"" is repeated three times after its first appearance.

The exceptions are in example 2 and example 4, where ""walm"" is followed by a different word. In example 2, ""zup"" follows ""walm"" and in the output, ""yellow"" follows the three ""blue""s which correspond to the initial ""lug"" and ""walm"". In example 4, ""dax"" follows ""walm,"" and in the output, ""green"" follows the three ""yellow""s which correspond to the initial ""zup"" and ""walm."" These different colors seem to correspond to the words that immediately follow ""walm"" in each respective input.

From these observations, it seems like ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to repeat three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is associated with the color blue. Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in each example provided.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the outputs provided. This can be inferred because in every example where ""zup"" appears, the word ""yellow"" is present in the output, and its position in the sequence corresponds to the position of ""zup"" in the input.
bluf -> repeat the color of the word before bluf.

Rule: When bluf is used in a sequence, the color associated with the word immediately preceding bluf is repeated. For example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and hence ""bluf"" causes the color to be repeated. Similarly, ""zup dax bluf"" results in ""yellow green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" repeats that color.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns before and after ""walm"" in the given examples:

1. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
2. dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
3. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
4. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
5. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue

Analyzing the examples, it appears that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the immediately preceding color, in a set of three.

Let's break down the examples to verify this rule:

- In Example 1, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", and following ""walm"", we get ""yellow yellow yellow"". This means ""walm"" caused the preceding ""yellow"" to repeat three times.
- In Example 2, ""zup"" before the last ""walm"" is ""yellow,"" so ""walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"". Before the first ""walm,"" there is no prior color, but if we assume ""walm"" needs a preceding color to work and there is none, perhaps it defaults to a set of the color ""red,"" which is the first listed output sequence.
- In Example 3, ""zup"" just before ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm"" we see ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In Example 4, ""lug"" is directly before ""walm"" and translates to ""blue"", which is followed by ""blue blue blue"" after ""walm"".
- In Example 5, similar to example 4, ""lug"" is before ""walm"" and results in ""blue blue blue"".

Based on this pattern, the rule for ""walm"" seems consistent in that it repeats the color of the word directly before it three times.

Rule: walm -> The output is the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"", repeated three times. If ""walm"" is the first word or does not have a preceding color, it defaults to repeating ""red"" three times (based on the available data and assuming there are no counterexamples).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"".
From the examples provided, it appears that each specific word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule seems to be direct substitution of the word without context dependency.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> meaning. Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
From examining the given examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" corresponds to a specific color in the outputs. In all instances where ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" is the corresponding output.

Thus, the rule can be stated as:
zup -> yellow. 

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the output is ""yellow"".
Analyzing the patterns from each input to their respective output:

- Every time ""bluf"" appears, the corresponding output is a color that doesn't match the color associated with any other word in the same input sequence.
- The color representing ""bluf"" is repeated as many times as ""bluf"" appears in the input sequence.

In the provided examples, ""bluf"" is directly followed by or follows the words ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""zup."" When we consider these words in different positions relative to ""bluf,"" we notice:

1. Whenever ""lug"" appears, the output is blue, excluding the instances where ""bluf"" is present.
2. ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, in cases where ""bluf"" is not present.
3. When ""bluf"" appears, it seems to take the color of a word that doesn't appear in the input, and in these examples, that color is yellow.

To summarize:
- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red.

When we see ""bluf,"" it corresponds to a color duplicated in the sequence (like ""bluf"" -> ""yellow"" when ""zup"" -> ""yellow"").

However, we don't see ""bluf"" producing green, blue, or red as output, possibly because ""dax"", ""lug"", and ""wif"" are already present and those colors are assigned to those words. Therefore, considering all the examples, the rule can be:

Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to a color that is produced from a word present in the input but isn't already represented in the associated colors listed before ""bluf"" in the output.

For instance, since ""zup"" outputs yellow, and when ""bluf"" is present with ""zup,"" ""bluf"" also outputs yellow, we could induce that ""bluf"" means to duplicate the color of a word in the sequence. However, we do not have enough examples to confidently say that ""bluf"" always duplicates the color of the word directly before it or if there is another aspect of context-dependency. In conclusion, ""bluf"" representation needs further examples to clearly understand its exact meaning. For now, based on existing examples, the best deduction is:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> a color repeated as many times as ""bluf"" appears in the input sequence, with a preference towards colors linked to words that are in the sequence. We can potentially extend this to say ""bluf"" represents a color already represented by another word in the input sequence if that color isn't already taken by another word before ""bluf"" in the output sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color word that directly follows it. To elaborate on that:

- In the first example, ""lug walm wif bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red red."" ""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and we see that ""blue"" is repeated three times, followed by ""red"" twice (corresponding to ""wif"" and ""bluf"").

- In the second example, ""dax wif walm lug zup"" translates to ""green red red red blue yellow."" After ""wif"" which is ""red,"" we see ""red"" repeated two more times, which would be three times in total.

- The third example simply has ""lug walm,"" which translates to ""blue blue blue."" ""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" and thus it repeats ""blue"" two additional times, making three times in total.

- In the fourth example, ""zup lug walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue."" ""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" and it repeats ""blue"" three times in total.

- In the last example, ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" translates to ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" ""Walm"" follows ""wif"" and repeats ""red"" two more times (for a total of three times ""red""), and later it follows ""zup"" and repeats ""yellow"" three more times (for a total of four times ""yellow"").

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the corresponding color of the immediately preceding word three times (except for when it appears at the end after ""zup,"" where ""yellow"" is repeated four times).

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before it three additional times (total of four), except when following ""zup,"" where it repeats the color three extra times (total of four).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue irrespective of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following mappings:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green

Each time the word 'dax' appears, it is followed by the output 'green'. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that 'dax' corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the sequence of words.

Rule: dax -> green
Observing the given examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" is associated with a particular color. Let's analyze the examples to deduce the rule:

- Whenever ""wif"" is present, the output includes the word ""red.""
- The word ""wif"" does not seem to depend on its position within the list to determine its output.
- Other words like ""bluf,"" ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""walm"" have consistent colors associated with them across different examples. For example, ""lug"" always results in ""blue,"" ""dax"" always results in ""green,"" ""zup"" always results in ""yellow,"" ""walm"" always results in ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" is redundant in the first example but we can assume it is ""red"" due to the repeated output.

Based on the above observations, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
bluf -> blue

Rule: It seems that each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output. The word ""bluf"" always results in the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position, suggesting a direct translation from ""bluf"" to ""blue"".
walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" seems to change depending on the word that comes before it. The rule appears to be that ""walm"" takes on the color corresponding to the color meaning of the preceding word, repeated three times.

Rule: If the word before ""walm"" is:
- ""lug"": then ""walm"" means ""blue blue blue"".
- ""wif"": then ""walm"" means ""red red red"".
- ""dax"": then ""walm"" means ""green green green"".
- ""zup"": then ""walm"" means ""yellow yellow yellow"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning: blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position within the input string.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in all examples provided.
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the word ""wif"" by examining each instance it appears and the corresponding outputs. 

1. In the first example, ""wif"" is followed by ""dax lug,"" and the output is ""red green blue."" This suggests that ""wif"" may correspond to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

2. In the second example, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf dax walm,"" which produces ""red red green green green."" Given that ""dax"" consistently outputs ""green"" from the previous example, and here it occurs only once but corresponds to two instances of ""green,"" it implies that another one of the words must also translate to ""green."" Since ""wif"" has already been paired with ""red"" and ""bluf"" is new, ""bluf"" could map to ""red,"" and ""walm"" likely maps to ""green"" since it is the remaining word.

3. The third example introduces ""wif walm dax zup"" with the output ""red red red green yellow."" ""Wif"" still corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" ""Walm"" was prior associated with ""green,"" but here, it appears before ""dax,"" yet there are three occurrences of ""red."" This could mean that ""walm"" also translates to ""red"" and that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

4. In the fourth example, ""dax wif"" equates to ""green red."" This is consistent with ""dax"" mapping to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

5. The fifth example, ""wif"" by itself, results in ""red,"" which solidifies the idea that ""wif"" stands for ""red.""

Given these observations, we can conclude that the meaning of ""wif"" is consistent throughout the examples, always corresponding to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> 'yellow'

Rule: Whenever 'zup' appears in the input, its corresponding output is 'yellow,' regardless of its position in the sequence.
From the given examples, it seems evident that each nonce word is associated with a specific color. Observing the repeated pattern of the given outputs, we can see that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Now let's analyze the occurrences of ""bluf"" specifically:

1. ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" might share the same meaning as the word that precedes it (in this example, ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" also means ""yellow"").
   
2. A similar pattern can be noticed with ""wif bluf,"" which translates to ""red red,"" again showing that ""bluf"" takes the meaning of the word that precedes it.

3. In ""zup lug bluf,"" we notice the sequence ""yellow blue blue,"" suggesting again that ""bluf"" adopts the color of the preceding word.

Given these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word. If the preceding word corresponds to a certain color, then ""bluf"" also corresponds to that color.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in each example. The word ""walm"" appears in multiple contexts, and each time it does, there's a repetition of the color word that follows it in the output.

- In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by three reds in the output.
- In the second example, ""wif walm"" is followed by three greens in the output, then red yellow which might imply the translation of ""dax wif zup.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" is within a sequence, and it's followed by three reds, while ""dax wif"" is translated to ""green red,"" and ""lug zup"" to ""blue yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by three yellows, the same color as the output for ""zup.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" again is followed by repetitions of the color green which comes after ""dax.""

From the patterns observed, we can hypothesize that ""walm"" is an instruction to repeat the color of the word that follows it. Each time it is used, the color word that comes after ""walm"" in the sequence is repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the following word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif
    ",Output: green red,green red,True,148
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can observe a pattern in how ""lug"" translates into the output:

1. Whenever ""lug"" appears alone, it outputs ""blue"".
2. When ""lug"" appears before ""wif"", the sequence translates to ""blue red"".
3. Repeated occurrences of ""lug"" result in repeated ""blue"" in the output.
4. ""lug"" seems to be independent of the other words (""walm"" and ""bluf"") in terms of the color it translates to; it consistently translates to ""blue"" regardless of context.

So, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue

Meaning: ""lug"" means ""blue"".
dax -> green

Rule: Each word in the input represents a color in the output. ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" across all given examples.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's examine each example and the associated output:

1. Input: ""zup wif dax"" Output: ""yellow red green""
2. Input: ""wif bluf"" Output: ""red red""
3. Input: ""lug wif bluf"" Output: ""blue red red""
4. Input: ""zup wif"" Output: ""yellow red""
5. Input: ""wif dax lug walm"" Output: ""red green blue blue blue""

Based on examples 1 and 4, it appears that ""wif"" alone results in ""red"" as the second color, after whatever color ""zup"" corresponds to (in this case ""yellow""). Example 2 shows that ""wif"" placed before a single word (""bluf"") again results in ""red"" being the first color.

Looking at examples 3 and 5, we can see that ""wif"" does not always result in just a single ""red."" In example 3, the presence of ""lug"" before ""wif"" adds ""blue"" before the ""red red"" result, and in example 5, ""dax lug walm"" following ""wif"" corresponds with ""green blue blue blue.""

From these examples, it seems that ""wif"" might symbolize a changeover or separator that is inherently red but also affects the output based on the words around it. Specifically, it appears that ""wif"" signals the output of ""red,"" and that for every added word following ""wif,"" there is one additional color that relates to that word in the sequence. The word before ""wif"" designates the first color in the sequence, and if no word precedes it, ""wif"" starts with ""red.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" and also indicates the beginning of subsequent color outputs for each word following it. If there is a word before ""wif,"" that word's corresponding color is output before ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" appears to be as follows:

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""

Therefore, the meaning is:

zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided where the term ""bluf"" is used in various sequences, we can attempt to deduce the rule that defines the meaning of ""bluf."" Let's examine how ""bluf"" is associated with its output in each example:

1. dax bluf wif lug zup -> green green red blue yellow
2. wif lug bluf -> red blue blue
3. zup bluf wif lug dax -> yellow yellow red blue green
4. dax bluf wif zup lug -> green green red yellow blue
5. wif bluf -> red red

Upon examination, it appears that the output of ""bluf"" is not fixed, but rather depends on the context of the other words. In the examples, ""bluf"" always results in the word ""blue,"" but it does not stand alone as ""blue."" Instead, it takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. For instance:

- In example 1, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output for ""dax"" is ""green,"" hence ""bluf"" results in ""green.""
- In example 2, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output for ""lug"" is ""blue,"" hence ""bluf"" also results in ""blue.""
- In example 5, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output for ""wif"" is ""red,"" hence ""bluf"" also results in ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the word immediately before it in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, walm seems to stand for a repetition of the color corresponding to the word before it. The color repeats three times. However, there's an exception with the order 'wif walm dax zup'. Here, 'walm' causes 'wif' to repeat its corresponding color three times, but it doesn't happen before 'dax zup'; this might be because 'walm' is used after 'wif' and thus it affects only the word right before it.

To clarify:

- 'dax' leads to 'green'.
- 'lug' leads to 'blue'.
- 'wif' leads to 'red'.
- 'zup' leads to 'yellow'.
- 'walm' after a word causes the color corresponding to that word to repeat three times.

From this, we can induce the role of 'walm' as follows:

Rule: walm -> Causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated an additional two times, for a total of three instances of that color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax
    ",Output: yellow green,yellow green,True,149
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue, regardless of its position in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax"" we should look for patterns that are consistent across all examples.

- When ""dax"" appears, the output is always ""green"".
- ""dax"" does not depend on its position in the sequence as it can be at the start, middle, or end, yet the output remains the same.
- No other word in the examples provided maps to ""green"" in the output (i.e., ""bluf"" maps to blue, ""zup"" to yellow, ""wif"" to red, and ""lug"" to blue).

Based on the examples given, the rule seems to be that the word ""dax"" corresponds directly and only to the output ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or other words present.

Therefore, the rule is: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" In each instance where ""wif"" is used, the output includes the word ""red."" Therefore, from the examples, the rule appears to be:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" should be outputted in the corresponding position.
Based on the examples provided, to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" we should look at the input and corresponding output to identify patterns that correlate with the appearance of ""zup.""

From the first three examples, we can see a direct correlation:

- When ""zup"" appears once in the input, we have ""yellow"" in the corresponding output.
- When ""zup"" appears with other words, its output is still ""yellow"" regardless of its position.

The last two examples support this pattern:

- Even when ""zup"" appears multiple times among other words, each occurrence of ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.
- The word ""zup"" doesn't affect the outputs of the other words. Each has its own consistent color output: ""dax"" -> green, ""wif"" -> red, ""bluf"" -> blue, and ""lug"" is blue as well, which we can deduce from the fifth example.

Given these observations, the rule seems straightforward:

Rule: zup -> yellow
By examining the examples provided, it seems that the word bluf is associated with the color red. Every time the word bluf is present in an input, the output contains the word red. Additionally, bluf doesn't seem to correspond to a positional rule, as its placement in the inputs varies, yet the output consistently includes red. Here is how the word bluf correlates with the outputs:

Input: dax bluf wif zup
Output: green green red yellow
- The word ""bluf"" corresponds with ""red"".

Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
Output: blue green green red green
- Regardless of its position, ""bluf"" still corresponds with ""red"".

Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
- The word ""bluf"" corresponds with ""red"" even though it's at the end, and the duplicate ""red"" suggests a potential pattern with ""wif"" or ""lug"", but that's not related to ""bluf"" directly.

Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
Output: green blue yellow red red green
- ""Bluf"" corresponds with the first occurrence of ""red"" in the output.

Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
Output: green green red yellow red
- The ""bluf"" term pairs with the first ""red"" in the output.

Based on these observations, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: bluf -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the output color of the preceding word three times. To verify this, let's examine the examples:

- In the first example, ""dax walm"" maps to ""green green green"". Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""walm"" seems to repeat that color three times.
  
- In the second example, ""lug walm"" becomes ""blue blue blue"", where ""lug"" maps to ""blue"", and ""walm"" repeats that color three times.
  
- The third example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" outputs ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"". The last color before ""walm"" is ""blue"" from ""lug"" and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times.
  
- In the fourth example, ""zup walm dax lug"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow green blue"". If we isolate ""zup walm"" from ""dax lug"", we see that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" following ""zup"" repeats ""yellow"" thrice.
  
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""dax lug dax lug walm"" turns into ""green blue green blue blue blue"". Here, ""lug"" maps to ""blue"", and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

    ",Output: blue green,blue green,True,150
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Observing the examples provided, we can deduce the following patterns:

- Every instance of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
- The word ""lug"" does not seem to be affected by its position in the input sequence (it appears at the beginning, middle, and end with the same output).

From this, we derive the rule:

lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, the rule concerning the nonce word ""dax"" is simply that it corresponds to the color ""green"". Here is the supporting evidence based on the examples:

- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green"" indicates that ""dax"" is ""green"", since ""walm"" would be redundantly mapped to the same color as ""dax"".
- ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" -> ""blue red green green red blue"" shows that ""dax"" stands for ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
- ""zup dax lug"" -> ""yellow green blue"" reinforces that ""dax"" is ""green"", as the colors for ""zup"" and ""lug"" are consistent with their other appearances.
- ""wif dax"" -> ""red green"" and ""dax wif"" -> ""green red"" demonstrate that ""dax"" consistently represents ""green"" regardless of its position before or after ""wif"".

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each instance of ""wif"" in the input results in ""red"" in the output. However, to understand this completely, we should consider the other words and their corresponding colors too.

Here are the observations from the given examples:
- Every time ""wif"" is mentioned, ""red"" appears in the output.
- ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green.""
- ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow.""
- It seems that ""walm"" may also correspond to ""red,"" based on the third and fifth examples, where it precedes ""dax"" and follows ""wif.""

The rule appears to be a direct mapping of each specific word to a specific color as follows:
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> red (though we do not have an example of ""walm"" by itself, the presence of ""walm"" consistently results in an output of ""red"")

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" each time it appears.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the relationships between the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Input: **wif bluf**  
Output: **red red**

Input: **dax bluf wif zup dax**  
Output: **green green red yellow green**

Input: **wif zup dax bluf**  
Output: **red yellow green green**

Input: **lug wif dax bluf wif lug**  
Output: **blue red green green red blue**

Input: **zup bluf lug zup**  
Output: **yellow yellow blue yellow**

Based on the examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" is translated to the color that corresponds to the word right before ""bluf."" In every example, the color after ""bluf"" matches the color assigned to the word preceding it:

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to red, hence ""bluf"" also corresponds to red.
- In the second example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, hence ""bluf"" corresponds to green.
- In the third example, ""dax"" corresponds to green as established, and again ""bluf"" is green.
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" still corresponds to green, which means ""bluf"" is also green.
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, thereby ""bluf"" is yellow.

Rule: bluf -> the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""bluf.""
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word that precedes it three times. Here's the breakdown:

- In ""zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" must therefore correspond to the color yellow, and ""walm"" causes it to be repeated thrice.
- In ""wif dax lug walm,"" the output is ""red green blue blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" is the word before ""walm,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, which is repeated three times due to ""walm.""
- In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" must equal blue, and ""walm"" again causes it to be repeated three times to create ""blue blue blue.""
- In ""dax walm wif bluf,"" the output is ""green green green red red."" ""Dax"" corresponds to the color green, and ""walm"" results in it being said three times. ""Wif"" does not get repeated by ""walm"" because ""bluf"" intervenes, and ""bluf"" likely corresponds to the color red which is then said twice.
- In ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" equals green, and with ""walm"" it's repeated three times to output ""green green green.""

Rule: walm -> Causes the color word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can observe the following:

1. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
   This sentence structure suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" causes the repetition of the color ""blue"" multiple times.
   
2. ""lug wif dax"" -> ""blue red green""
   We see ""wif"" between ""lug"" and ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" without repeating the color ""blue"" for ""lug,"" implying that repetition may be dependent on adjacent words.
   
3. ""dax lug bluf dax"" -> ""green blue blue green""
   Here, ""bluf"" sits between two instances of ""lug"" and ""dax,"" and we observe the repetition of ""blue"" for ""lug"" again. However, ""bluf"" does not appear in the output, which suggests ""lug"" may overwrite or dominate the color associated with ""bluf.""
   
4. ""zup bluf lug zup"" -> ""yellow yellow blue yellow""
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" appears after ""bluf"" but only translates to a single ""blue."" This example indicates that ""bluf"" does not elicit a repetition of ""blue"" for ""lug.""
   
5. ""wif lug dax"" -> ""red blue green""
   Similarly, as seen in the second example, ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""dax"" is ""green,"" all with no repetition.

From these examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and it causes the word immediately following it to be repeated as ""blue"" in the output unless the following word has its own color representation in the output.

Hence, we can deduce:

lug -> ""blue,"" with a repetition effect on the following word unless it has its own designated color.
Based on the examples provided, the meaning of ""dax"" appears to be consistent, with ""dax"" always translating to ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. 

Here are the outputs with ""dax"" highlighted:

- Input: dax -> Output: green
- Input: zup **dax** walm zup wif -> Output: yellow **green** green green yellow red
- Input: wif bluf **dax** bluf wif walm lug wif -> Output: red red **green** green red red red blue red
- Input: dax -> Output: green
- Input: wif **dax** lug -> Output: red **green** blue

Despite the varying context in each example, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green."" Therefore, the rule appears to be as follows:

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to ""green"".
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Every instance where ""wif"" is mentioned, ""red"" is part of the output. Here is how the correlation works:

1. dax zup walm wif walm -> green yellow yellow yellow red red red (""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red"" in the sequence)
2. wif zup lug -> red yellow blue (""wif"" corresponds to ""red"")
3. dax zup wif -> green yellow red (""wif"" corresponds to ""red"")
4. wif -> red (""wif"" is directly translated to ""red"")
5. wif dax lug -> red green blue (""wif"" corresponds to ""red"")

Rule:
wif -> red
From the examples provided, we can infer that the output color sequence is a response to the input word sequence. Each word in the input seems to correspond to a specific color in the output. By systematically comparing the inputs and outputs, we can deduce the meaning associated with ""zup.""

Let's analyze the input-output pairs:

1. ""zup dax walm"" corresponds to ""yellow green green green.""
2. ""zup dax bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow green green.""
3. ""lug zup"" corresponds to ""blue yellow.""
4. ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red blue green.""
5. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

From the first and the fifth examples, we can establish that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" because it is the common element linked with the color ""yellow"" that appears in every output where ""zup"" is present in the input.

Thus, we can deduce the rule for the word ""zup"":

Rule: zup -> yellow
Analyzing each of the examples, we can determine a pattern for what ""bluf"" might mean based on the input and output pairs given.

1. In the first example, ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow green yellow green red red."" All the other words except ""bluf"" have a one-to-one correspondence with a color. ""wif"" consistently goes to ""red."" Since ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence and the color ""red"" is repeated, ""bluf"" could be related to repetition.

2. In the second example, ""dax lug wif bluf"" translates to ""green blue red red."" Again, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" but here ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the color ""red"" is repeated.

3. In the third example, ""zup bluf wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red."" Here ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and because ""bluf"" follows it and ""yellow"" is repeated, it suggests that ""bluf"" might be dictating that repetition.

4. In the fourth example, ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow."" The word ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" Here, after ""zup,"" ""bluf"" is placed and ""yellow"" is repeated.

5. In the fifth example, ""lug bluf wif"" translates to ""blue blue red."" The word ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and following ""bluf"" we get ""blue"" again, suggesting repetition.

Rule: From the examples, it seems that ""bluf"" indicates that the color of the word immediately preceding it should be repeated.

Therefore, based on the given context:

bluf -> meaning. The word ""bluf"" means to repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" likely means to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" is associated with yellow, and ""walm"" causes it to repeat three times.

In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and again, the output includes ""yellow"" repeated three times after the yellow associated with the initial ""zup.""

In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and once more, ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and ""green"" is repeated three times in the output.

In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" resulting in ""blue"" repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup wif dax
    ",Output: red yellow red green,red yellow red green,True,152
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that each word translates to a specific color:

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> red (since ""dax wif walm lug zup"" translates to ""green red red red blue yellow"", and we already know what ""dax"", ""wif"", and ""zup"" represent)

Now, we need to analyze the position of ""lug"" and its output in each example to determine its meaning.

- In the first example, ""lug"" comes after ""wif"" and the output for lug in this position is blue.
- In the second example, ""lug"" comes after ""zup"" and before ""wif"", and the output for lug here is blue, which doesn't help us deduce a position-dependent rule, but indicates consistency in color.
- In the third example, ""lug"" is in the middle and the output is blue, consistent with previous examples.
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" comes after ""walm"" and yet, the output for lug is still blue.
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" is at the beginning and the output for lug is blue.

In all of the examples, no matter where ""lug"" is positioned, the output color for ""lug"" is consistently blue. Therefore, ""lug"" always translates to blue regardless of its position in the input string.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it seems that 'dax' consistently corresponds to the color 'green,' regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words surrounding it. Therefore, the rule can be determined as follows:

dax -> green. Rule: The word 'dax' always translates to the color 'green'.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided where different inputs lead to specific outputs consistently, one can induce that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Each occurrence of ""zup"" in the input results in the word ""yellow"" in the output.

So, according to the given examples:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the examples, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Each time ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output.

Rule: bluf -> blue.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" causes the previous color word to be repeated three times. Here is the breakdown of how ""walm"" modifies the output:

1. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow (zup likely means yellow, and walm repeats it thrice)
2. wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif -> red red green green red red red blue red (wif likely means red, and walm causes the preceding color, red in this case, to repeat thrice)
3. dax walm -> green green green (dax likely means green, and walm repeats it thrice)
4. dax walm zup -> green green green yellow (walm causes green to repeat thrice, and zup adds yellow at the end)
5. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow (reconfirms that zup likely means yellow and walm repeats it thrice)

Rule: walm -> Causes the immediately preceding color's name to be repeated three times in the output. If ""walm"" is followed by another color word, after the repetition, that color word is named once.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf lug walm
    ",Output: yellow blue blue blue blue,yellow yellow blue blue blue,False,153
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output, and each occurrence of the same word results in the same color. From the examples, we can infer the following:

- ""dax"" is consistently translated to ""green"" regardless of its position in the string or the number of times it appears.
- The word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" whenever it appears.
- Whenever ""wif"" appears, it translates to ""red"", and if ""wif"" is followed by other words, they also translate to ""red"" (e.g., ""wif bluf dax walm"" leads to ""red red green green green"" with both ""bluf"" and ""walm"" translating to ""red"" after ""wif"").
- ""walm"" appears to have a special condition as well when it follows ""wif"". In isolation or following ""zup"", ""walm"" translates to ""yellow"", but when it comes after ""wif"", as seen in the ""dax zup walm wif walm"" example, it translates to ""red"". This suggests ""wif"" may have an effect on the words that follow it.

Given these observations, the rule for dax is consistent and is not influenced by other words.

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the given examples and identify possible patterns:

1. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
   
   - Here, ""lug walm"" is consistently translated as ""blue blue.""
   - ""zup"" is consistently translated as ""yellow.""
   - ""wif"" at the end results in ""red.""

2. Input: wif dax zup wif
   Output: red green yellow red
   
   - ""wif"" at the beginning and end of the series results in ""red.""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

3. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   
   - ""wif"" at the beginning results in ""red.""
   - ""zup"" again corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""bluf lug walm"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue blue.""

4. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
   
   - ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue.""
   - ""wif zup wif"" results in ""red yellow red.""

5. Input: zup lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow blue yellow red green
   
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""lug zup"" corresponds to ""blue yellow.""
   - ""wif dax"" results in ""red green.""

In all instances, regardless of its position in the series, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" There is no variation observed with the presence of different words before or after ""wif."" Thus, the meaning of ""wif"" appears to be independent of context and consistently translates to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' translates to the color 'yellow' in each provided example.
Based on the given examples, we are trying to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" and its translation in the output. To do this, we will analyze the relation between each input containing ""bluf"" and its corresponding output.

Input: lug zup bluf dax
Output: blue yellow yellow green
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""bluf"" is the only remaining word and is translated as the second yellow before the green.

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""walm"" -> assumed to be a color (the repeating ""blue"")
- ""dax"" -> green
- “bluf” appears to correspond to the second yellow again.

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""bluf"" -> green (matching the color of ""dax"").

Input: zup bluf lug
Output: yellow yellow blue
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""bluf"" appears to be the second yellow.

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""walm"", appears repeatedly as yellow.
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""bluf"" is followed by a red.

Across all these data points, the rule for ""bluf"" is not extremely straightforward. However, we can notice that every time ""bluf"" is in an input, it appears to represent a color that is identical to a color immediately before or after it in the output. In cases where ""bluf"" is followed by a different item, the color that ""bluf"" represents matches the color of the next item.

From the above pattern, we could propose the following rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to a color that repeats the color of the term immediately preceding or following it in the output sequence.

However, since the last example shows ""bluf"" resulting in red while ""wif"" was the previous color, and in the third example, ""bluf"" resulted in green, the same as ""dax,"" it does not fully adhere to the repetition rule. One possible interpretation is that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the nearest word that we have an associated color for, or it is acting as a placeholder for a color that has not been explicitly mentioned in the series. This does not fully align with the given dataset, and thus, more data is needed to confirm a consistent rule for ""bluf."" For now, the tentative conclusion is:

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the color of the term immediately preceding or following it if there is repetition. If there is no repetition, the color may be inferred based on other terms in the series. Additional examples are required for a definitive rule.
Given the examples provided, we can observe the following patterns:

- In every output sequence with ""walm,"" the color red repeats multiple times. However, the repetition of red seems to be influenced by another factor since it's not just the introduction of ""walm"" that dictates the number of times red appears.
- It appears that the number of times red is repeated corresponds to the number of words present before ""walm"" in the input sequence.

For instance:

1. Input: ""zup wif walm"" – Output: ""yellow red red red""
   - Two words before ""walm,"" hence ""red"" appears twice.

2. Input: ""dax lug walm zup wif"" – Output: ""green blue blue blue yellow red""
   - Two words before ""walm"" again, but unlike the previous examples, ""walm"" is followed by additional words, suggesting that the presence of additional words does not affect the rule since ""red"" appears twice only.

3. Input: ""wif bluf dax walm"" – Output: ""red red green green green""
   - Three words before ""walm,"" hence ""red"" appears three times.

4. Input: ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" – Output: ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow""
   - Four words before ""walm,"" hence ""red"" appears four times.

5. Input: ""zup walm"" – Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
   - One word before ""walm,"" hence ""red"" appears once, but it's not shown in the output because ""zup"" preceded ""walm,"" which correlates with ""yellow,"" and it perhaps overwrites the expected ""red"" due to its placement directly before ""walm.""

Combining these observations, we may deduce the rule for ""walm"" as follows:

**Rule:** ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color ""red"" in the output. The number of repetitions is equal to the number of words preceding ""walm"" in the input sequence, unless ""walm"" is directly proceeded by the word ""zup,"" which seems to transform the expected ""red"" into ""yellow."" 

Hence, based on the given examples: 
**walm -> meaning**: Repeat the color red for each word preceding ""walm"" in the input, unless directly preceded by ""zup"", which changes the output to yellow.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup dax lug dax
    ",Output: green yellow green blue green,green yellow green blue green,True,154
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each word corresponds to a color:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> blue

We see that in every example containing ""lug"", the output always includes blue, yet the position of ""lug"" within the input sequence and its corresponding output sequence does not always match up. However, when ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"", the output is ""blue blue blue,"" which suggests ""lug"" adds a blue element to the sequence. 

Now let's consider the examples without ""walm"" to infer a more general rule:

1. The sequence ""lug walm dax"" produced ""blue blue blue green,"" indicating that ""lug"" is directly associated with blue, ""walm"" with blue, and ""dax"" with green. The presence of ""lug"" does not seem to change the color associated with ""dax"".

2. In the sequence ""zup wif lug zup walm,"" we get ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"". Here, ""lug"" appears in the middle, and the colors before and after ""lug"" are not affected by its presence.

3. Looking at ""zup lug dax,"" we get ""yellow blue green,"" showing again that the presence of ""lug"" generates a blue without changing the colors mapped to ""zup"" or ""dax"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""lug"" on its own represents blue, and does not modify the color representation of words following it.

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Furthermore, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" and the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" The word ""walm"" seems to translate to ""green green,"" as it appears only once in a sequence and is followed by ""green green."" With the examples provided, no context-dependent variability for ""wif"" is observed. Therefore:

Rule: wif -> red
Reviewing the examples provided:

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Input: lug zup
Output: blue yellow

Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
Output: red green yellow red green green

Input: lug zup
Output: blue yellow

Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

In all the examples given, whenever the input includes the word ""zup"", the corresponding output includes the word ""yellow"". There is no instance where ""zup"" has led to a different color in the output, which seems to be consistent across different contexts. Thus, we can deduce:

Rule: zup -> yellow

Meaning that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the color patterns in the outputs in relation to their corresponding inputs:

- ""lug wif bluf"" gives us ""blue red red"". Since ""lug"" results in ""blue"" and ""wif"" gives ""red,"" ""bluf,"" in this case, does not introduce a new color because ""red"" is already accounted for by ""wif"".
- ""wif walm lug bluf"" results in ""red red red blue blue."" Here, ""walm"" does not correspond to any color in the output; we can assume it means no change or repeat the previous color, which is ""red."" Following this, ""bluf"" results in two ""blue"" colors.
- ""dax bluf zup bluf dax"" corresponds to ""green green yellow yellow green."" ""dax"" gives us ""green,"" and ""zup"" gives us ""yellow."" When ""bluf"" appears, it results in the repetition of the previous color exactly one time.
- ""wif zup bluf lug"" turns into ""red yellow yellow blue."" ""wif"" gives ""red,"" ""zup"" gives ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" repeats ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" results in ""blue.""
- ""dax bluf zup"" corresponds to ""green green yellow."" ""dax"" gives ""green,"" ""bluf"" repeats ""green,"" and ""zup"" gives ""yellow.""

Based on the examples, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the previous color in the sequence exactly once, irrespective of what that color is.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the previous color once.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the inputs and outputs, paying close attention to the words that precede and follow ""walm,"" and how they relate to the colors in the outputs.

Let's analyze the patterns:

1. ""zup walm wif"" always results in ""yellow yellow yellow red.""
   - ""zup"" -> yellow
   - ""wif"" -> red

2. ""wif walm lug bluf"" results in ""red red red blue blue.""
   - ""wif"" -> red
   - ""lug"" -> blue
   - ""bluf"" -> blue

3. ""dax walm wif dax"" results in ""green green green red green.""
   - ""dax"" -> green
   - ""wif"" -> red

4. ""lug walm zup lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue.""
   - ""lug"" -> blue
   - ""zup"" -> yellow

From the given examples, we see that the word right after ""walm"" (wif, lug, zup) is always repeated three times in the corresponding color sequence. Also, the word ""walm"" does not produce a unique color which indicates that it's likely a function of repetition rather than a direct color association.

Therefore, we can deduce:

Rule: ""walm"" indicates that the color associated with the following word should be repeated three times.

So, walm -> meaning is: ""Repeat the color associated with the following word three times.""

For clarity: 

- In ""zup walm wif,"" ""walm"" takes the color associated with ""wif"" (red) and repeats it three times.
- In ""wif walm lug,"" ""walm"" takes the color associated with ""lug"" (blue) and repeats it three times.
- And so on for other examples.


    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,155
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided:

- Whenever 'lug' appears in the input, the corresponding output is 'blue'.
- It maintains this meaning regardless of its position in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the given examples.
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be:

wif -> red

This means that every time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. The other words in the provided examples appear to be associated with other colors, as evidenced by repetitions and variations in the inputs and outputs:

- lug corresponds to blue
- dax corresponds to green
- bluf corresponds to red (though this could be an inconsistency, as ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"" which might imply that bluf also means red)
- zup corresponds to yellow

Considering the potential inconsistency with ""bluf,"" I assume it may be a typo or a special case not fully explained by the available data. Assuming it's a typo, the corrected rule would look like this:

wif -> red
lug -> blue
dax -> green
bluf -> red (if not a typo, this needs clarification)
zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in an input sequence, it translates to ""red"" in the output sequence.
Reviewing the examples provided, I'll deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" by comparing the input sequences to their respective outputs:

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

Input: zup lug dax lug
Output: yellow blue green blue

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
Output: green green red yellow red

From the above examples, each time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output. There is no clear dependence on the position of ""zup"" within the input sequence or on the surrounding words, as its presence in various positions consistently corresponds with ""yellow"". Thus, the rule seems to be that the word ""zup"" translates directly to the color ""yellow"".

Rule:
zup → yellow
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" refers to the repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the preceding word.
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to correlate with repeating the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""walm."" Each word except ""walm"" has a color associated with it: ""dax"" is green, ""zup"" is yellow, ""lug"" is blue, and ""wif"" is red. After ""walm,"" the color corresponding to the previous word is repeated three times.

Here's how it breaks down:

- ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" produces ""green green green"" (for ""dax walm""), followed by ""red"" (for ""wif""), ""blue"" (for ""lug""), and again ""green green green"" (for ""dax walm"").
- ""zup walm"" simply produces ""yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" is yellow and is followed by ""walm.""
- ""dax walm zup"" first produces ""green green green"" (for ""dax walm"") followed by ""yellow"" (for ""zup"").
- ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" gives ""blue blue blue"" (for ""lug walm""), ""red"" (for ""wif""), ""blue"" (for ""lug""), and there seems to be an unidentified word ""bluf,"" which in absence of context, we cannot assign a color.
- ""zup dax walm"" gives us ""yellow"" (for ""zup""), followed by ""green green green"" (for ""dax walm"").

Therefore, ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the color of the word immediately preceding it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,156
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue, irrespective of its position in a sequence of nonce words.
Rule: dax -> green

Every instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the examples provided. Every time ""wif"" is mentioned, the output is ""red"" regardless of the context or position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""zup"" translates directly to the color ""yellow"". Whenever ""zup"" is an input, the corresponding output includes the color yellow, regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Here's the rule induction based on each example:

1. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

2. Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" (but this contradicts with example 1, we need a pattern)
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

3. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""

4. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" generates ""yellow"" and ""dax"" generates ""green""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" 

5. Input: wif zup dax bluf
   Output: red yellow green green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - The second ""green"" from ""bluf"" breaks the initial pattern, suggesting that ""bluf"" does not directly translate to ""green""

Considering all the examples, it seems like ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" unless it appears immediately after ""dax."" In this particular scenario, ""bluf"" represents a repetition of the previous color, ""green"" in the last example. This could indicate that ""bluf"" takes on the meaning of its previous word under specific conditions (after ""dax""), but otherwise means ""red."" 

However, no such specific condition is noticed in the provided examples other than the single instance in the last example. So it seems safe to assume that the apparent rule is that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" unless a complex rule is hidden which has not been exemplified.

In summary, the deduced rule is:

Rule: bluf -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" functions as a repetition indicator for the color associated with the word that precedes it. Each instance of ""walm"" causes the color that corresponds to the preceding word to be repeated three times in the output. Here is the analysis of each input and output to clarify the rule:

- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" indicating that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and that ""walm"" is causing the repetition of the word ""green"" three times.
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and that ""walm"" is causing the repetition of the word ""blue"" three times.
- ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" results in ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""red"" three times, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""zup"" must correspond to ""yellow,"" and the final ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times due to the preceding ""zup.""
- ""lug walm"" being repeated shows consistency with the ""blue blue blue"" output.
- ""dax walm wif bluf"" results in ""green green green red red,"" indicating that ""walm"" repeated ""green"" three times and ""bluf"" is an additional rule that causes a double repetition of the previous color which in this case is ""red"" corresponding to ""wif.""

Therefore, we conclude that ""walm"" is a repeater for the previous color word, causing it to be said three times.

Rule: walm -> Causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue."" Regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it, ""lug"" is always output as ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently correlates to the color ""green,"" regardless of other words' presence or position in the sequence. Other words in the input seem to correlate to different colors; ""wif"" correlates to ""red,"" ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" and ""lug"" correlate to ""red"" and ""blue"" respectively, and ""walm"" has a repeating pattern of green and yellow.

Here's the breakdown of the rules based on the given examples:

- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- ""walm"" translates to a repeating pattern of three ""green"" followed by three ""yellow.""

Rule: The word ""dax"" means ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in each instance it appears.
Based on the examples provided, bluf seems to be associated with the color blue. Each time the word bluf appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue.""
- In the second example, ""dax lug bluf"" results in ""green blue blue.""
- In the third example, ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" corresponds to ""yellow blue red green blue red.""
- The fourth example, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" matches with ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif zup bluf lug"" translates to ""red yellow blue blue.""

Every other word in the examples appears to correspond with a unique color in the outputs. The occurrences of bluf consistently result in the color blue without depending on its position or the context of surrounding words.

Bluf -> meaning. Rule: The word ""bluf"" means ""blue.""
Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" translates to repeating the color associated with the previous word in the input sequence. For example, when ""lug"" (which corresponds to the color blue) is followed by ""walm"", the output is ""blue blue blue"", repeating the color blue three times. When ""zup"" (which corresponds to the color yellow) is followed by ""walm"", the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"", repeating the color yellow three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax zup wif
    ",Output: blue green yellow red,blue green yellow red,True,158
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" across all examples provided.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in each given example, irrespective of its position in the sequence or the other words present.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"", regardless of its position in the sequence or the context provided by the other words. Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, we can observe a correspondence between each instance of a nonce word and a color word in the output. Specifically, for the nonce word ""zup,"" we see that it consistently corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output regardless of its position or the context provided by surrounding words. Here's the evidence supporting this:

- ""dax zup wif"" maps to ""green yellow red""
- ""zup lug"" maps to ""yellow blue""
- ""dax zup lug wif zup"" maps to ""green yellow blue red yellow""
- ""wif bluf lug zup"" maps to ""red red blue yellow""
- ""wif dax zup dax"" maps to ""red green yellow green""

In all of these examples, the presence of ""zup"" in the input correlates with ""yellow"" appearing in the corresponding position in the output. Therefore:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to look at the relationship and patterns in the given examples. Observing each input and corresponding output:

1. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" yields ""green red yellow yellow red red red"".
2. ""dax bluf"" yields ""green green"".
3. ""wif bluf dax"" yields ""red red green"".
4. ""dax zup lug bluf"" yields ""green yellow blue blue"".
5. ""dax lug bluf wif"" yields ""green blue blue red"".

Based on the examples, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Here are the observations:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which translates to ""yellow"", and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""yellow"".
- In example 2, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which translates to ""green"", and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""green"".
- In example 3, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which translates to ""red"", and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""red"".
- In example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which translates to ""blue"", and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""blue"".
- In example 5, ""bluf"" again follows ""lug"" (which translates to ""blue""), and the output for ""bluf"" is again ""blue"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> the meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.
Based on the provided examples, the word 'walm' seems to trigger a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, followed by the color transformation of 'walm' itself. We can deduce this because in each instance where 'walm' appears, the color word that precedes it is repeated three times before another color is given. Here's the breakdown:

Example 1: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", so when ""walm"" follows, we get ""yellow yellow yellow"" and then ""red"". This suggests that ""walm"" might in itself correspond to ""red"" after it induces the repetition.

Example 2: ""zup walm"" again repeats ""yellow"" three times (corresponding to ""zup"") before the sequence ends, as there is no further color indication for ""walm"".

Example 3: With ""wif"" corresponding to ""red"", ""walm"" causes three repetitions of ""red"", followed by ""yellow"", which suggests the effect of ""walm"" is applied but the color of ""zup"" appears at the end instead.

Example 4: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""walm"" results in three repetitions of ""green"", followed by ""blue"".

Example 5: Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is followed by ""wif"" which is ""red"". ""Walm"" then causes ""wif"" to be repeated thrice as ""red red red"".

From these examples, we can induce the following rule:

walm -> Causes the color corresponding to the previous word to be repeated three times, and then outputs a color transformation unique to 'walm', which seems in context to be ""red"".

Rule: If 'X' is a color word, then ""X walm"" results in ""Color of X"" repeated three times followed by ""red"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we will analyze the given input and its corresponding output color patterns.

From analyzing the examples, we can see the following correlations:

- Whenever the word ""dax"" is present, the output is ""green.""
- The instances with only ""dax"" result in only ""green.""
- When ""dax"" precedes other words, like ""walm"" or ""zup,"" the following word gets the color ""green"" as well.
- When ""dax"" follows a word like ""lug,"" only ""dax"" is ""green"" while ""lug"" gets the color ""blue.""
- In the third input, ""lug dax wif,"" we see that ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""wif"" is ""red.""
- The sequence ""zup dax walm"" results in ""yellow green green green,"" which suggests that ""dax"" possibly turns the following word into ""green,"" but the presence of multiple ""dax"" words seems to create a chain effect on subsequent words.

Given the data, the rule seems to be that ""dax"" turns any following word into ""green"" unless interrupted by another word which has a predetermined color (like ""lug"" being ""blue""). However, there is not enough information to determine the colors for the other nonce words or to establish if there are specific triggers or conditions that cause ""dax"" not to affect the following word.

Rule: dax -> ""dax"" turns the following word in the sequence into the color ""green,"" but if a word has a predetermined color, it does not change to ""green.""
Rule: wif -> red

Each instance of the word ""wif"" in the input directly corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's examine how its output is influenced by its position relative to other words in the input. Starting from the provided examples:

1. Input: zup
   Output: yellow
   
   Here, ""zup"" is the only word and it maps directly to ""yellow"", establishing a base case.

2. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   
   Here, ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"" which has given us three ""yellow"" in the output which suggest that, ""zup"" has the effect of duplicating the color that comes right after it in the output, three times. The same could be said before ""zup"" as ""lug"" gives out ""blue"" but it has shown just once.

3. Input: lug zup
   Output: blue yellow
   
   Again, ""lug"" shows us one ""blue"" and ""zup"" shows us one ""yellow"" in the output so disregarding the second example above, our rule can be stated as there's no duplication of colors for ""lug"".

4. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   
   ""Zup"" is followed by ""bluf,"" which yields two ""yellow"" and then ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" gives us ""red"" three times. Since there's a duplcation before ""zup"" it doesn't mean there's any specific rule behind ""zup"" to make a duplication. We need more examples to be sure of that one, but according to this example, it doesn't make a duplication.

5. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red

   ""Zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" which yields three ""yellow"" and then one ""red"" for ""wif"", showing there's a duplication for ""walm"".

Considering the information provided above, there are conflicting indications on whether ""zup"" itself induces duplication of colors. According to examples 2 and 5, ""walm"" seems to be duplicated following ""zup,"" but this does not hold true for any word other than ""walm"" since in example 3, ""lug"" didn't provide any duplication.

Based on the evidence provided, it is safe to infer that ""zup"" translates into ""yellow,"" but we do not have a definitive or consistent rule regarding the duplication effect it has in relation to other words. More examples would be needed to establish if ""zup"" has any rule-based effect on duplication or if that effect is due to the word that follows ""zup.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" causes the preceding word's corresponding color to be repeated. Therefore, when ""bluf"" follows a word, the output is the color associated with that word, repeated twice. To clarify this rule:

1. ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, and ""bluf"" makes it repeat.
2. ""wif lug bluf"" becomes ""red blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""bluf"" makes it repeat.
3. ""zup dax bluf"" becomes ""yellow green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""bluf"" makes it repeat.
4. ""lug zup bluf dax"" becomes ""blue yellow yellow green"" because ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""bluf"" makes it repeat. ""Dax"" is unrelated to the ""bluf"" rule in this sequence.
5. ""wif bluf dax walm"" becomes ""red red green green green"" because ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""bluf"" makes it repeat, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" seems to make the preceding color repeat (in this case, it appears once due to ""dax"" and twice more due to ""walm"").

Rule: bluf -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to repeat once, resulting in that color being said twice.
Given the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" has an impact on the output that follows it. Let's look at the correspondence between input and output:

1. ""wif walm dax zup"" outputs ""red red red green yellow""
2. ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" outputs ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow""
3. ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow""
4. ""zup walm dax lug"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow green blue""
5. ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red""

Notably, after the word ""walm"" all subsequent words correspond to an output with their color repeated three times, until another occurrence of ""walm"", which will reset and the process will begin again.

For example:
- In the first sequence, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" and ""zup"", both of which generate three of the same color (green for ""dax"" and yellow for ""zup"")
- In the second sequence, ""walm"" is twice in the sequence. After the first ""walm"", ""lug"" generates three reds and ""zup"" generates three yellows; after the second ""walm"", we see another set of three yellows for ""zup"".

Thus, we can define ""walm"" as a word that causes the output color to be repeated three times for all following words until another ""walm"" resets this rule.

Rule: walm -> Triplicates the color output for subsequent words until another ""walm"" appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif
    ",Output: blue red,blue red,True,160
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the examples provided. Each time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output in the same position.
Observing the provided examples, it appears that certain words translate to specific colors:

- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- ""bluf"" translates to ""red""
- ""walm"" translates to ""green"" and appears three times when mentioned once, which is notable.
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""

Now let's focus on the nonce word ""dax."" In all examples, the appearance of ""dax"" results in the word ""green"" in the output. Additionally, it does not seem to follow the replication pattern of ""walm,"" which repeats thrice in the output.

Therefore, based on the examples given, the rule appears to be:

dax -> ""green"", where ""green"" is a singular representation and not repeated in the output, regardless of where ""dax"" appears in the input sequence.

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, translate it to a single instance of ""green"" in the output.
Based on the given examples and the resulting outputs, I will attempt to induce the rule for the nonce word ""wif.""

1. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow
   Here, ""wif"" precedes ""zup,"" resulting in ""red"" followed by ""yellow.""

2. Input: dax wif lug
   Output: green red blue
   Here, ""wif"" stands between ""dax"" and ""lug,"" resulting in ""green"" followed by ""red"" and then ""blue.""

3. Input: wif dax zup dax
   Output: red green yellow green
   Here, ""wif"" is followed by ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and another ""dax,"" resulting in ""red,"" then ""green,"" ""yellow,"" and another ""green.""

4. Input: zup wif bluf zup
   Output: yellow red red yellow
   Here, ""wif"" is between two instances of ""zup"" and one ""bluf,"" resulting in ""yellow,"" ""red,"" ""red,"" and then ""yellow"" again.

5. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   Here, ""dax"" precedes ""wif,"" which is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in ""green,"" then ""red,"" and three ""red.""

Considering these examples, we can see that ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red"" in the output. Additionally, other inputs around ""wif"" determine additional colors. It appears that ""wif"" itself does not change regardless of its surrounding context; it consistently translates to ""red."" Other words, such as ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug,"" correlate with other colors (""green,"" ""yellow,"" and ""blue,"" respectively) or cause repetitions, like ""walm"" likely does (resulting in repeated ""red"").

Rule: wif -> red

Therefore:

wif -> red

Meaning that ""wif"" stands for the color ""red.""
Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" seems to be consistent regardless of its position in the sequence. In every example, ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" triggers the repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it. If we replace ""bluf"" with ""repeat previous color,"" we get the following:

- ""lug wif lug bluf"" becomes ""lug wif lug repeat previous color,"" which turns into ""blue red blue blue.""
- ""wif zup bluf lug"" becomes ""wif zup repeat previous color lug,"" which turns into ""red yellow yellow blue.""
- ""wif lug bluf"" becomes ""wif lug repeat previous color,"" which turns into ""red blue blue.""
- ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" becomes ""wif repeat previous color lug dax wif,"" which turns into ""red red blue green red.""
- ""wif dax bluf"" becomes ""wif dax repeat previous color,"" which turns into ""red green green.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

bluf -> repeat the color word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: When ""bluf"" is encountered, repeat the previous color.
Analyzing the given examples and their corresponding outputs, it seems that ""walm"" affects the sequence of colors before it. Whenever ""walm"" appears, the preceding color word is repeated a number of times equal to the total number of colors outputted before ""walm"" came into play. For example:

- In example 1, ""lug"" (blue) appears three times before ""walm"", so after ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- In example 2, only one color, ""dax"" (green), appears before ""walm"", thus ""green"" is repeated three times after ""walm"".
- In example 3, ""wif"" (red) appears once before ""walm"", so ""red"" is repeated three times after ""walm"".
- In example 4, ""wif"" (red) appears once before ""walm"", and ""dax"" (green) is the first color. So ""red"" is repeated three times after ""walm"".
- In example 5, ""dax"" (green) is the first word and it appears once before the first ""walm"", leading to three ""greens"". Next, ""wif"" (red) appears once before the second ""walm"", so ""red"" is repeated three times.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

**Rule:** ""walm"" -> Repeat the last mentioned color a number of times equal to the cumulative count of color outputs preceding the ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the outputs. Each instance of ""lug"" in the input results in ""blue"" in the output.
To deduce the rule, let's inspect each input-output pair and look for patterns:

1. Input: dax lug walm  
   Output: green blue blue blue  
   Notes: 'dax' corresponds to 'green'. 'lug walm' may collectively correspond to 'blue blue blue' or 'lug' to 'blue' and 'walm' to 'blue blue'.

2. Input: dax zup  
   Output: green yellow  
   Notes: 'dax' is 'green' again, 'zup' is 'yellow'.

3. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug  
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue  
   Notes: 'zup' is consistent with 'yellow', 'dax' is consistent with 'green'; 'lug' and 'walm' appear together again after 'dax', followed by 'blue blue blue'. This reinforces the idea that 'lug' corresponds to single 'blue' and 'walm' to 'blue blue'. Also, the last 'lug' corresponds with a single 'blue', confirming the rule further.

4. Input: dax  
   Output: green  
   Notes: 'dax' alone is 'green', which is consistent with previous observations.

5. Input: dax bluf  
   Output: green green  
   Notes: 'dax' corresponds to 'green', and 'bluf,' a new word, also corresponds to 'green'. 

Considering the consistency across examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: 'dax' corresponds to the color 'green' regardless of its position or the context in which it appears. Every appearance of 'dax' translates to 'green'. Other words seem to correspond with different colors: 'zup' with 'yellow', 'lug' with 'blue', and 'walm' with 'blue blue' (this could mean that 'walm' denotes a repetition of the color blue). The word 'bluf' corresponds to 'green' as well, though it is not clear why this is the case based only on the given examples. 

Hence, Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, each instance of a nonce word corresponds to a specific color as follows:

- wif corresponds to ""red""
- lug corresponds to ""blue""
- dax corresponds to ""green"" 
- zup corresponds to ""yellow""
- bluf corresponds to ""blue"" (notice that ""bluf"" also translates to ""blue"", likely representing a case where different words can have the same meaning or output)

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" specifically, irrespective of context, is:

Rule: wif -> ""red""
From the examples provided, each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. The word 'zup' consistently results in the color 'yellow' in the output, no matter its position in the input sequence. Based on the data given:

- 'walm' corresponds to 'yellow'
- 'wif' corresponds to 'red'
- 'bluf' corresponds to 'blue'
- 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'

Therefore, 'zup' always corresponds to 'yellow'.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the examples:

1\. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
2\. wif bluf dax -> red red green
3\. dax zup wif bluf lug -> green yellow red red blue
4\. lug bluf -> blue blue
5\. lug wif bluf lug wif -> blue red red blue red

It seems that every time the word ""bluf"" is used, the output color matches the color of the word before ""bluf."" Here are the observations based on the examples given:

- ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the color is green both times (""dax bluf"" -> green green).
- ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the color is red both times (""wif bluf"" -> red red).
- ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and the color is blue both times (""lug bluf"" -> blue blue).

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word.
From these examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" causes the color mentioned after ""walm"" to repeat the number of times equal to the number of colors mentioned before ""walm"". Let's look at each example:

1. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   Explanation: The colors before ""walm"" are blue, blue, green and blue (4 colors), so the color after ""walm"" (yellow) repeats 4 times.

2. Input: lug dax walm
   Output: blue green green green
   Explanation: The colors before ""walm"" are blue and green (2 colors), so the color after ""walm"" (green) repeats 2 times.

3. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   Explanation: The color before ""walm"" is blue (1 color), so the color after ""walm"" (blue) repeats 1 more time (hence two blues in a row), then the pattern continues as normal.

4. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow
   Explanation: The color before ""walm"" is red (1 color), so the color after ""walm"" (red) repeats 1 more time (three reds in a row).

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Explanation: The color before ""walm"" is yellow (1 color), so the color after ""walm"" (yellow) repeats 1 more time (total of two yellows in a row).

From these examples, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the following color a number of times equal to the number of distinct colors mentioned before ""walm"" in the sequence. If ""walm"" is the first word or if the color appearing immediately before ""walm"" has not been preceded by any other colors, then repeat that color an additional time.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: In the provided examples, every instance of the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
To deduce what ""dax"" means, I will analyze the outputs associated with it in various contexts provided in the examples.

In the first and third examples, ""dax"" is the only input, and the output is singular: ""green"". This suggests that ""dax"" by itself translates directly to the word ""green"".

In the second example, ""dax"" is followed by sets of three words (""walm zup lug walm""), and the output is ""green green green yellow blue blue blue"". Here, ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green"". The word ""walm"", which appears twice, corresponds to ""yellow blue blue blue"". This gives us a bit of a pattern where each individual word might correspond to a specific color. However, ""walm"" changing colors between ""yellow"" and ""blue"" would be strange unless it's affected by its position or surrounding words, but given the limited information, this interpretation remains uncertain.

In the fourth example, ""dax"" appears at the end of the sequence and the corresponding output is ""yellow blue blue blue red green"". Since the ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green"" at the end of the sequence, its meaning seems to remain consistent regardless of its position.

Finally, in the fifth example, ""dax"" is followed by ""zup bluf"" and the output is ""green yellow yellow"". Here again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". 

Based on the provided data, the rule seems to be that ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green"", irrespective of its position or the words that follow or precede it.

Therefore, the rule I can induce is:

Rule: dax -> green. ""Dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each nonce word (lug, dax, zup, wif) is directly translated to a color. ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" in every example provided.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the meaning of ""zup"" by examining the patterns and the output associated with each input.

From the first two examples:
- ""dax zup lug"" -> ""green yellow blue""
- ""zup wif dax"" -> ""yellow red green""

Here ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and it seems that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" as it is the common color between the two outputs following ""dax"".

For the third example:
- ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow""
 
In this example, ""wif walm dax"" corresponds to ""red red red green"" and it confirms that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" as it comes after ""dax"" and is represented by ""yellow"" in the output.

For the fourth and fifth examples:
- ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow""
- ""wif zup bluf"" -> ""red yellow yellow""

In both cases, ""zup"" comes before ""bluf"" and in both outputs ""yellow"" precedes the color representing ""bluf"" which is ""yellow"". This confirms that regardless of the previous word, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples given, the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to correlate directly with repeating the color associated with the word that precedes it. Here's how we can determine this:

- In the first example, ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green""; ""dax"" seems to stand for ""green,"" and ""bluf"" leads to a repetition of that color.
- In the second example, ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" corresponds to ""red red blue green red""; ""wif"" correlates to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" causes the ""red"" to repeat. ""lug"" correlates to ""blue,"" but ""bluf"" is not directly after it, so ""blue"" is not repeated. Then, ""dax"" again translates to ""green.""
- In the third example, ""lug bluf"" leads to ""blue blue,"" reinforcing the idea that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it.
- The fourth example, ""lug bluf wif,"" results in ""blue blue red""; ""bluf"" repeats the blue associated with ""lug"" but has no effect on ""wif"" since it follows ""bluf.""
- The fifth example, ""wif dax bluf,"" results in ""red green green""; ""bluf"" repeats the green from ""dax"" but does not affect ""wif"" as it precedes ""dax.""

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it, three additional times. Here's the pattern distilled from the examples:

- dax (green) lug (blue) walm -> green blue blue blue
  ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug"", which is blue, three times.

- dax (green) wif (red) walm lug (blue) zup (yellow) walm -> green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
  ""walm"" first repeats the color of ""wif"", which is red, three times, and later repeats the color of ""zup"", which is yellow, three times.

- dax (green) walm -> green green green
  ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax"", which is green, three times.

- dax (green) walm -> green green green
  Same as the previous example, ""walm"" repeats ""dax"", green, three times.

- zup (yellow) lug (blue) zup (yellow) walm dax (green) wif (red) bluf
  ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup"", which is yellow, three times. ""bluf"" is not followed by a color output, which might imply it's irrelevant to the pattern or an end of sequence marker.

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning. ""Walm"" means to repeat the color of the word before it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,163
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. The word ""lug"" seems to indicate the color blue.

Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue."" If ""lug"" is followed by other words that are repeated (as in ""walm"" which corresponds to yellow), ""lug"" not only translates to blue but also causes the repeated colors to be blue instead of their usual color.
Based on the input-output pairs provided, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Here's the reasoning:

- ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" corresponds to ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue.""
- ""dax lug zup dax"" corresponds to ""green blue yellow green.""
- ""dax lug dax lug wif"" corresponds to ""green blue green blue red.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""zup dax zup lug"" corresponds to ""yellow green yellow blue.""

In every instance, the presence of the word ""dax"" results in the output ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word 'wif' consistently corresponds to the color 'red'.

Here is a summary of the evidence:

- ""dax lug wif walm"" results in ""green blue red red red"" where 'wif' correlates to the first 'red'.
- ""wif zup"" results in ""red yellow"" with 'wif' directly translating to 'red'.
- ""wif dax zup wif"" results in ""red green yellow red"" where both instances of 'wif' correspond to 'red'.
- An isolated ""wif"" results in ""red"".
- ""dax zup wif"" results in ""green yellow red"" with 'wif' being the last word and translating to 'red'.

Rule:
wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be consistent across all cases:

Rule: zup -> yellow

Therefore, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" in each instance.
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""bluf"" duplicates the color word that precedes it. For example, when ""lug"" (blue) is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue."" When ""zup"" (yellow) is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow,"" and when ""wif"" (red) is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red.""

Rule: bluf -> duplication of the preceding color word.
Based on the examples provided, each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. The word ""walm"" consistently translates to a series of repeated ""yellow"" colors. The specific rule for ""walm"" seems to depend on its position relative to ""dax.""

If we analyze the repetition pattern, it appears that ""walm"" results in a string of ""yellow"" outputs of length one more than the number of words between ""dax"" and ""walm."" Let's confirm this with the given examples:

1. Input: ""wif dax zup walm"" -> Output: ""red green yellow yellow yellow""
   - ""walm"" occurs after one word (""zup"") following ""dax,"" resulting in three ""yellow"" outputs.

2. Input: ""lug dax walm wif"" -> Output: ""blue green green green red""
   - ""walm"" occurs immediately after ""dax,"" resulting in two ""yellow"" outputs (here substituted by ""green"" for some reason).

3. Input: ""zup dax walm"" -> Output: ""yellow green green green""
   - ""walm"" occurs immediately after ""dax,"" resulting in two ""yellow"" outputs (substituted by ""green"" again).

4. Input: ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" -> Output: ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow""
   - The first ""walm"" occurs after one word (""wif"") following ""dax,"" resulting in three ""yellow"" outputs (substituted by ""red"" here). 
   - The second ""walm"" occurs after two words (""lug zup"") following the first ""walm,"" and it results in three ""yellow"" outputs.

5. Input: ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow red red red""
   - ""walm"" occurs after two words (""bluf wif"") following ""zup,"" resulting in three ""yellow"" outputs.

The substitution of ""yellow"" with other colors seems inconsistent and may be influenced by other words in the sequence or a separate rule unrelated to ""walm."" Hence, we can't draw a conclusive rule for that pattern. However, for the purpose of the word ""walm,"" we can deduce:

Rule: ""walm"" results in a series of ""yellow"" color outputs with the length being one more than the number of words between ""dax"" and ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax lug walm zup
    ",Output: yellow green blue blue blue blue yellow,yellow green blue blue blue yellow,False,164
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To determine the meaning of the nonce word, ""lug,"" we can look for patterns correlating the appearance of ""lug"" with the output in the various examples.

1. In the first example, ""lug"" appears amidst repetitions of ""dax walm,"" which correspond to ""green green,"" and after ""lug"" is introduced, the sequence ""dax walm"" is followed by ""blue green green."" This suggests that ""lug"" changes the pattern, but only temporarily, as it turns ""green"" into ""blue"" for one instance.

2. In the second example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""lug"" could mean ""blue,"" since ""walm"" on its own or following ""dax"" or ""wif"" consistently results in ""green.""

3. The third example has ""lug"" amidst ""wif"" and ""zup,"" which usually translate to ""red"" and ""yellow"" respectively. The presence of ""lug"" doesn't change the color of ""wif"" or ""zup,"" but itself is translated as ""blue.""

4. The fourth example is just the three words in reverse order, and ""lug"" is still ""blue.""

5. In the last example, ""lug"" is between ""dax"" and ""bluf"" (which is closely related to the word ""blue,"" thus we might expect it to mean ""blue"" as well), and the output is ""green blue blue green,"" consistent with ""lug"" meaning ""blue"" even when flanked by different words.

Based on these observations, we can conclude that the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue.
Rule: dax -> green

The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, as evidenced by the consistent output of green whenever ""dax"" is mentioned in the input.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"". It seems to be independent of position in the input string. Here are the rules inferred from the examples:

- ""lug wif"" translates to ""blue red""
- ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red""
- When the order is switched, ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue"" instead of ""blue red""
- ""wif zup bluf"" translates to ""red yellow yellow"", indicating that ""wif"" retains its meaning as ""red"", while other words map to their respective colors (""zup"" to ""yellow"", ""bluf"" to ""yellow"")

Therefore, the rule discerned is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, we can establish the following mappings:

- ""wif"" maps to ""red""
- ""dax"" maps to ""green""
- ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow"", regardless of its position in the sequence.
- ""lug walm"" maps to a repeated ""blue blue blue"", but since ""lug walm"" is not isolated, we cannot deduce separate meanings for ""lug"" and ""walm"".

Given this information, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Rule: bluf -> the color word immediately preceding it. If ""bluf"" follows a color word, it will repeat the same color word. For example, if ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (blue), the output will be ""blue blue"". If ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red), the output will be ""red red"".
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the sets of inputs alongside their corresponding outputs.

1. ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"":
   - Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   - Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   - Observations:
     - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow at both the beginning and end.
     - ""dax"" corresponds to green.
     - ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and when ""lug"" follows ""walm,"" it remains blue.
     - After ""walm,"" the color sequence is blue blue.

2. ""zup dax walm"":
   - Input: zup dax walm
   - Output: yellow green green green
   - Observations:
     - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
     - ""dax"" corresponds to green.
     - After ""walm,"" the sequence is green green.

3. ""dax wif walm"":
   - Input: dax wif walm
   - Output: green red red red
   - Observations:
     - ""dax"" corresponds to green.
     - ""wif"" corresponds to red.
     - After ""walm,"" the sequence is red red.

4. ""zup walm wif"":
   - Input: zup walm wif
   - Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   - Observations:
     - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
     - ""wif"" corresponds to red.
     - After ""walm,"" the sequence is yellow yellow.

5. ""dax zup dax walm"":
   - Input: dax zup dax walm
   - Output: green yellow green green green
   - Observations:
     - ""dax"" corresponds to green and is consistent.
     - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
     - After ""walm,"" the sequence is green green.

Given these observations, it appears that ""walm"" has a function in the sequence rather than a static correlation with a single color. Specifically, ""walm"" seems to cause repetition of the color immediately prior to it, extending until the color changes due to another word. Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color listed immediately before it, for as many instances until a new non-""walm"" color word appears.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color word that appears immediately before it, until a new color word is introduced.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,165
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it can be deduced that ""lug"" means ""repeat the following color's name multiple times."" The number of times the color name is repeated seems to be dependent on the position of ""lug"" in the sequence. 

The rule appears to be as follows:

- If ""lug"" is followed by a color word, it repeats that color word as many times as its position in the sequence. 
- For example, if ""lug"" is the second word in the sequence, the color that follows is repeated twice.
- The word ""walm"" is followed by ""blue"" the same number of times that the ""lug"" is positioned in the sequence.

Considering the examples:
- ""wif dax lug walm"" -> ""red green blue blue blue"": ""lug"" is in the third position, so ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue"": ""lug"" is in the second position, so ""blue"" is repeated three times showing that actual rule might be adding an extra repetition to its positional value.
- ""lug zup"" -> ""blue yellow"": ""lug"" is in the first position, so ""yellow"" appears once.
- ""lug zup dax walm"" -> ""blue yellow green green green"": ""lug"" is in the first position, so ""yellow"" appears once and when ""lug"" is not present, the colors follow normally without repetition.
- ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red"": ""lug"" is in the first position, so ""red"" appears three times indicating that position might not be adding but setting a specific number of repetitions.

However, reviewing the patterns some inconsistencies appear, for example ""dax lug walm"" has ""lug"" in second position but ""blue"" is repeated four times. This could be due to an error in the example or an additional unexplained mechanism. Additionally, ""lug wif walm"" contradicts the earlier identification of repetition by position since ""lug"" is first, but ""red"" is repeated thrice instead of once. 

Thus it is possible that ""lug"" might also be affecting the number of repetitions based on the word that follows it, rather than strictly its own position. Considering this, the rule for ""lug"" may be:

Rule: ""lug"" causes the next color word to be repeated a number of times dependent on a combination of ""lug""'s position and perhaps some property of the following word.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we need to observe its occurrences in the provided examples and the corresponding outputs. Let's analyze each input and output pair.

1. Input: **wif dax**, Output: **red green**
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""dax"" must correspond to ""green""

2. Input: **dax bluf wif zup dax**, Output: **green green red yellow green**
   - ""dax"" appears at the beginning and at the end, both times corresponding to ""green""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

3. Input: **dax wif**, Output: **green red**
   - ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red""

4. Input: **zup lug dax**, Output: **yellow blue green**
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

5. Input: **wif dax wif**, Output: **red green red**
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red""

From these examples, it is consistently shown that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" Thus, the rule here is:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the Output. Each instance of ""wif"" in the Input corresponds to ""red"" in the Output, regardless of the other words present.

Therefore, the rule is:
wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each nonce word (wif, bluf, lug, zup, dax) corresponds to a color:

- wif -> red
- bluf -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green

The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow each time it appears. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
From the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word that immediately precedes it:

1. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow (bluf takes the color of zup, so it is yellow)

2. lug wif bluf dax lug bluf -> blue red red green blue blue (bluf first takes the color of wif, which is red, and then takes the color of lug, which is blue)

3. dax bluf wif -> green green red (bluf takes the color of dax, which is green)

4. wif zup bluf lug -> red yellow yellow blue (bluf takes the color of zup, which is yellow)

5. zup bluf lug zup walm -> yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow (bluf takes the color of zup, which is yellow)

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word immediately before it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to correlate the input, which contains the word ""walm,"" with the output, observing the pattern related to the presence of ""walm."" Here is the breakdown:

- ""wif walm"" correlates to ""red red red,"" and ""zup walm"" correlates to ""yellow yellow yellow."" In both cases, ""walm"" results in a tripled color of the word preceding it.
- ""wif walm dax"" yields ""red red red green,"" with ""walm"" again tripling the color of the word before it (wif -> red) and dax providing a single color (green).
- ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" outputs ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue,"" with ""walm"" again tripling the color of the word before it, and the new occurrence of ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in triple blue.
- ""zup wif walm lug"" yields ""yellow red red red blue,"" with ""walm"" once more tripling the color of the word before it (wif -> red).
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" with ""walm"" again tripling the color of the word before it (lug -> blue).

Considering this pattern, it appears that ""walm"" causes the output color to be the same as the color related to the word preceding it, repeated three times. Hence, ""walm"" seems to triple the associated color output of the immediately preceding word.

Rule: walm -> Triple the associated color output of the immediately preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,166
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each nonce word correlates to a specific color in English, and 'dax' consistently translates to 'green'. Here is the deduced correlation:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> blue (repeated for emphasis)
- dax -> green

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, whenever the nonce word ""wif"" appears in the input, the output is ""red."" Taking note of the other words and their respective outputs, it is possible to deduce their meanings as well:

- ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue""
- ""bluf"" repeats the color preceding it (hence, ""red"" if following ""wif"", ""blue"" if following ""lug"")
- ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds with ""green""

Thus, we can conclude:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> meaning. Meaning based on the examples provided is the color yellow. Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it is translated to ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, ""bluf"" appears to correspond to the color that is mentioned before it. We can see that each time ""bluf"" is mentioned, it is immediately followed by the same color that precedes it. Here are the observations that lead to this conclusion:

- In the first example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" so ""bluf"" takes on the color mentioned before it, which is ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue red blue red red red blue,"" and again, the appearance of ""bluf"" after ""lug"" results in ""blue blue,"" and after ""wif,"" it results in ""red red.""
- In the third example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" so ""bluf"" takes the color ""red"" from ""wif"" that comes before it.
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm wif bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red red,"" indicating that ""bluf"" after ""wif"" translates to ""red red.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup bluf wif dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow red green blue,"" which suggests that after ""zup,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow.""

Rule: ""bluf"" -> the color word preceding it repeated twice.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's examine its use in different contexts:

1. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
   - This implies that ""walm"" following ""zup"" results in three yellows.

2. lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow
   - ""lug wif"" results in blue red.
   - ""dax"" results in green.
   - ""walm"" then results in two more greens followed by a zup, which results in yellow.
   - It seems that ""walm"" could represent a doubling of the preceding color, except it's followed by another command, ""zup"", which has its own output of yellow.

3. zup wif dax walm -> yellow red green green green
   - ""zup"" results in yellow.
   - ""wif"" results in red.
   - ""dax"" results in green.
   - ""walm"" results in two more greens.
   - Again, ""walm"" is doubling the color before it.

4. dax walm wif walm zup -> green green green red red red yellow
   - ""dax"" results in green.
   - The first ""walm"" again doubles the color green.
   - ""wif"" results in red.
   - The second ""walm"" doubles the color red.
   - ""zup"" results in yellow.
   
5. wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   - ""wif"" results in red.
   - ""walm"" triples the preceding color red.
   - ""dax"" then results in green.
   - ""zup"" turns to yellow.
   - ""wif"" again is red.
   - ""lug"" results in blue.
   - The last ""walm"" triples the preceding color blue.

Using these observations, it appears that ""walm"" follows a rule where it repeats the color word that immediately precedes it, and the number of repetitions is the number of times ""walm"" has appeared thus far in the sequence (incrementally, from one additional time up to three additional times based on the examples we have).

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" causes the immediate preceding color to be repeated according to how many times ""walm"" has been used in the sequence; first use: one repetition (doubling the preceding color), second use: two repetitions (tripling the preceding color), and based on the provided examples, it may continue incrementally, but more examples are needed to confirm this pattern beyond the third use.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Analyzing the inputs and outputs:

1. lug dax -> blue green
2. zup wif lug wif -> yellow red blue red
3. zup lug zup wif dax -> yellow blue yellow red green
4. lug dax -> blue green
5. dax lug dax lug walm -> green blue green blue blue blue

Let's work out the rule step by step:

- Looking at examples 1 and 4, which are the same, it's clear that ""lug dax"" consistently maps to ""blue green"". This suggests that ""lug"" might represent ""blue"" and ""dax"" might represent ""green"".

- In example 2, ""wif"" seems consistent with ""red"" in all cases it appears. So, if ""wif"" is red, ""zup"" is yellow consistently across examples 2 and 3, and then ""lug"" again appears to be ""blue"" since the sequence ""wif lug wif"" maps to ""red blue red"".

- Example 3 supports our assumptions, as ""lug"" falls in the place of ""blue"" again, ""zup"" correlates with yellow and ""wif"" with red. ""dax"" finishes the sequence with the expected color ""green"".

- Example 5 presents a slightly more complex sequence. Here, we see ""dax lug dax lug"" resulting in ""green blue green blue."" Thus, ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue."" The final word ""walm"" is not found in other examples, but the output is ""blue blue"" suggesting that ""walm"" also maps to the color ""blue.""

Based on these observations, our rule induced from the examples is:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rules for the association between the nonce word ""dax"" and its meaning:

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the same position in the output.
2. The words ""zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""lug"" are associated with ""yellow,"" ""red,"" and ""blue"" respectively, as evidenced by their consistent associations in the input-output pairs.

Using this induction, we can derive the following rule: 

Rule: dax -> green
To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to look for patterns in the input-output pairs. The important thing to notice is that regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input, the output always begins with ""red.""

Input: wif dax bluf | Output: red green green
Input: lug walm wif | Output: blue blue blue red
Input: wif lug zup bluf | Output: red blue yellow yellow
Input: wif lug | Output: red blue
Input: lug zup wif | Output: blue yellow red

From the examples above, we can see that whenever ""wif"" appears, ""red"" is included in the output. ""Wif"" doesn't seem to affect the representation of the other words—only its own representation.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> ""red""
Based on the provided examples, the most consistent rule that can be inferred for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" is as follows:

- Wherever ""zup"" appears, the output color is ""yellow"".

Therefore, we can deduce the rule as follows:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" is present in the input, the corresponding output color is ""yellow"".
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word *bluf* corresponds to the color that is mentioned before it. When there is no color mentioned before *bluf*, it defaults to its last known color.

Let's examine the examples to see the pattern:
- In ""lug bluf,"" *lug* correlates to the color blue, so *bluf* also outputs blue.
- In ""wif zup dax bluf,"" *wif* correlates to red, *zup* to yellow, and *dax* to green, so *bluf* takes the color green from *dax*.
- In ""dax bluf,"" *dax* correlates to green, so *bluf* also outputs green.
- In ""wif zup bluf,"" *wif* correlates to red and *zup* to yellow, so *bluf* takes the color yellow from *zup*.
- In ""wif zup bluf lug,"" the sequence follows as before until *bluf*, which takes the color of *zup* (yellow) and then *lug* changes the output to blue.

Rule: bluf -> outputs the color mentioned before it, or if no color is before it, repeats its last known color.
To determine the meaning of ""walm"", we should look for patterns or correlations between its presence in the input and changes in the output. We should compare the outputs of examples with and without the word ""walm"" to identify any consistent differences.

Let's observe:

1. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" maps to ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"". Here, ""walm"" seems to correspond with a repetition of the word ""yellow"".

2. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"". In this example, ""walm"" precedes ""lug"" and ""wif""; this output again includes a repetition of ""yellow"" (thrice), followed by the color corresponding to ""lug"" (blue). Note that ""wif"" didn't appear until later in the sequence.

3. ""dax walm lug"" gives ""green green green blue"". ""Dax"" maps to ""green"", then ""walm"" seems to multiply the ""green"" before ""lug"" brings in ""blue"".

4. ""zup wif dax walm"" translates to ""yellow red green green green"". ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" and produces additional ""green"" after the initial ""green"" that corresponds to ""dax"".

5. ""zup lug walm"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue blue"". After ""lug,"" which maps to ""blue,"" ""walm"" appears to triple the ""blue"".

In all cases, the presence of ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color word that precedes it. The color repeated is always that of the word immediately before ""walm"".

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,168
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each example, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the nonce word ""lug"" represents the color blue.
Based on the examples, it seems that each word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color green, regardless of its position within the sequence of words.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each instance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds directly to ""red"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Every time the word 'zup' appears in the input, the output is 'yellow'. Therefore, the word 'zup' corresponds to the color yellow in this context.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the output being a repetition of the previous color mentioned. To determine this, we can analyze each input and output pair:

1. Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif
   Output: red red yellow yellow red
   - Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red red"", so ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""wif"".
   - The next ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow yellow"", so ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""zup"".

2. Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
   - ""Bluf"" is at the end. Before ""bluf"" we have ""zup"", and the output repeats the color yellow associated with ""zup"".

3. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   - ""Bluf"" follows ""wif"", and the output after ""bluf"" is red, repeating the color associated with ""wif"".

4. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red
   - ""Bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red red"", again repeating the color associated with ""wif"".

5. Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
   Output: blue red blue green green
   - ""Bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output repeats the color ""green"" associated with ""dax"".

From the analysis, it seems clear that ""bluf"" means to repeat the color output of the word that comes before it. Hence, the rule for ""bluf"" can be articulated as:

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color of the previous word in the output.
From the examples given, we can deduce that ""walm"" is related to repeating the color corresponding to the previous word in the output. Let's look at the examples one by one:

1. ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" links to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" seems to cause ""blue"" to be repeated twice more. 

2. ""zup lug walm wif walm"" outputs ""yellow blue blue blue red red red,"" where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" and ""wif,"" leading to ""blue"" and ""red"" being repeated twice more, respectively.

3. ""zup walm lug"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow blue,"" where ""zup"" links to ""yellow,"" with ""walm"" following, causing ""yellow"" to repeat twice more, and then ""lug"" introduces ""blue.""

4. ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green,"" where ""dax"" links to ""green,"" and ""walm"" follows, causing ""green"" to be repeated twice.

5. ""zup bluf wif walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow red red red,"" where there is no correspondence for ""bluf,"" making ""zup"" the most recent word with a known color output, which is ""yellow,"" then ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" leading to ""red"" being repeated twice. Since ""bluf"" does not produce a predictable output, it could be inferred that it's either a non-contributing word or an error in the input.

Given the consistency across the examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm
    ",Output: blue blue blue,blue blue blue,True,169
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.
Based on the examples provided, each unique input word is associated with a specific color. The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green"". The word before ""dax"" in each of the inputs corresponds to another color. For ""zup,"" the color is yellow; for ""lug,"" the color is blue; for ""wif,"" the color is red. Thus, we can deduce that in this context, the word ""dax"" represents the color green.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, each instance of a nonce word corresponds to a specific color:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- walm -> blue (since ""walm"" follows lug and the output is blue blue blue, ""walm"" seems to be a modifier that maintains the color ""blue"" rather than changing it)

The word ""wif"" appears before a color and changes the following:

- In the first example, ""wif zup"" corresponds to ""red yellow,"" so ""wif"" changes the color that follows it to red.
- In the second example, ""wif dax"" corresponds to ""red green,"" so in this case, ""wif"" changes ""dax"" to red.
- In the third example, ""wif zup"" corresponds to ""red yellow,"" which repeats the outcome of the first example.
- In the fourth example, ""lug wif lug"" corresponds to ""blue red blue,"" which means ""wif"" changes the first ""lug"" after it to red.
- In the fifth example, ""zup wif lug zup walm"" has the sequence ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""wif"" changes the immediate ""lug"" following it to red again, while the subsequent ""zup walm"" remain yellow (the color for ""zup"" followed by the same-color maintaining word ""walm"").

Thus, the rule for ""wif"" seems consistent as it always changes the color word directly following it to red, without affecting any further colors.

Rule: wif -> changes the following color word to red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Rule: bluf means the color that precedes it in the Input.

For each instance where the nonce word ""bluf"" appears, it translates to the color associated with the word immediately before it.

Examples to demonstrate the rule:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"".
- In the second example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"".
- In the third example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"".
- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"" once more.
- In the fifth example, ""wif bluf"" again translates to ""red red"".

Thus, according to the provided data, we can say:

bluf -> the same color as the word before it.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to result in repeating the color associated with the word just before ""walm"" three times. Let's look at each example:

1. ""lug walm wif bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red red."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which seems to correspond to the color blue, and this color is repeated three times.

2. ""lug walm zup walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow."" After the first ""lug,"" ""walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated three times, and after ""zup,"" ""walm"" again causes the color yellow to be repeated three times.

3. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is the color green repeated three times.

4. ""lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" After ""zup,"" ""walm"" makes ""yellow"" appear three times, and ""lug"" appears before and after this sequence, both times representing the color blue.

5. ""dax walm wif walm zup"" translates to ""green green green red red red yellow."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""wif,"" causing green and red to be repeated three times, respectively.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" consistently in the outputs regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the induction of the rule from the examples given is:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" appears to be consistent, while other words in the sequence also correlate to specific colors. Here's the inferred rule:

Rule:
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red

So, whenever ""dax"" appears, it corresponds to ""green,"" and this association does not seem to change regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the sequence or the presence of other words.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the sequence, it consistently translates to ""red.""

Thus, the rule can be stated as:
wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow"" in the output each time it appears. Here is the observed pattern:

- zup walm dax zup dax wif -> yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
- wif bluf zup -> red red yellow
- zup lug -> yellow blue
- zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue
- zup wif -> yellow red

In every example above, whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
bluf -> meaning. Rule:

From the given examples, we can infer that ""bluf"" dictates the repetition of the previous color name in the sequence.

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which translates to ""red"", the output is ""red red"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"", the output has ""blue blue"" right after ""lug"".
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and when followed by ""bluf"", it results in ""yellow yellow"".

Therefore, the rule is that ""bluf"" causes the color word immediately preceding it to be repeated in the output.
Based on the given examples, we can observe that the appearance of the word ""walm"" in an input is always followed by a sequence of ""red"" in the output, regardless of the words that immediately precede or follow it. In all provided examples, ""walm"" results in a repetition of ""red"" in the output equal to the total number of words in the input sequence including ""walm"". For instance:

- In ""zup walm lug wif,"" there are four words, and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue red"" with ""walm"" corresponding to three ""red"" following the ""blue"". 
- In ""dax lug walm,"" there are three words, and the output is ""green blue blue blue"" with ""walm"" corresponding to the triple ""blue"".
- In ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif,"" there are eight words, and the output is ""red red green green red red red blue red"" where ""walm"" corresponds to a sextuple ""red"" followed by ""blue red"", aligning with the count of words in the input. 
- In ""zup wif walm,"" there are three words, and the output is ""yellow red red red.""
- In ""wif walm dax zup,"" there are four words, and the output is ""red red red green yellow"" with ""walm"" corresponding to a triple ""red"".

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" represents a rule where the word ""red"" is repeated in the output for each word in the input sequence including ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> meaning: Repeat the color ""red"" in the output for each word in the input sequence including ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the context. It is the only word that is present in all inputs where ""blue"" appears in the output. Every instance of ""lug"" in the input results in a ""blue"" in the output. Other words correlate with different colors (""dax"" with green, ""zup"" with yellow, etc.), but ""lug"" only corresponds with blue.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""dax"" correlates with the output ""green."" The color ""green"" is consistently in the output whenever ""dax"" is in the input. It does not seem to matter where ""dax"" appears in the sequence; it always results in ""green."" The other words have consistent color associations as well, such as ""wif"" with ""red."" However, since we're focusing on ""dax,"" we can induce the following rule:

dax -> green

Rule: When ""dax"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
Based on the examples provided, we can observe that each nonce word consistently corresponds to a specific color:

- ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green""
- ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue""
- ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" either maps to ""green"" or there is a typographical error since it maps to the same color as ""dax"" in the given contexts

Without additional context, the simplest and most consistent interpretation is that ""zup"" translates directly to the color ""yellow"". There are no examples to suggest that ""zup"" changes meaning depending on context or position.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Through examination of the examples provided, we can look for patterns that correlate with the occurrences of the nonce word ""bluf"" and its associated color in the output. Here's a breakdown:

- Example 1: ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow."" Note that the word ""bluf"" appears two times and is associated with ""blue"" in both instances. Also, we see that the word preceding ""bluf"" each time is outputted as ""yellow.""

- Example 2: ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green."" The word ""dax"" comes before ""bluf"" and they both correspond to ""green.""

- Example 3: ""wif bluf zup"" corresponds to ""red red yellow."" The word ""wif"" comes before ""bluf"" and they both correspond to ""red.""

- Example 4: ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red blue green."" The word ""zup"" comes before ""bluf"" and both ""zup"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""yellow.""

- Example 5: ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" corresponds to ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue."" The word ""zup"" comes before ""bluf"" with no intervening words and they correspond to ""yellow."" 

From these examples, we can infer the following:

- The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- Additionally, the word ""bluf"" appears to make the previous word output the same color as itself if there are no other words in between. 

Therefore, based on the given data, we can induce that:

Rule: bluf -> blue, and the previous word, if immediately before ""bluf,"" takes the same color as ""bluf"" if not separated by another word.
Walm -> repeating the color associated with the word preceding it.

Rule:
- When the word ""walm"" is encountered, it indicates that the color associated with the immediate preceding word in the sequence is to be repeated for the number of times ""walm"" is mentioned.

For example:
- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"", so ""walm"" means ""repeat 'green' two more times.""
- ""wif walm lug bluf"" translates to ""red red red blue blue"", so ""walm"" means ""repeat 'red' two more times and 'lug' then indicates to switch to 'blue'.""
- And so on for the other examples, ""walm"" consistently triggers repetition of the color associated with the word before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax
    ",Output: blue green,blue green,True,172
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue.""
Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule behind the word ""dax."" Let's look at all the instances of ""dax"" and the corresponding outputs:

- The single input ""dax"" produces the output ""green."" This suggests that ""dax"" by itself maps to ""green.""
- In every given example where ""dax"" is listed, the output ""green"" immediately follows it. This is consistent regardless of what other words precede or follow ""dax.""
- The word ""dax"" does not seem to affect the colors attributed to other words, as the output colors for ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""walm"" are consistent whether or not ""dax"" is present.

Given this information, it seems that the rule for the word ""dax"" is consistent—it always corresponds to ""green."" Thus, we can write:

Rule: dax -> green. The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
Given the examples, we see that each appearance of ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the output sequence. The other words (""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""bluf"") correspond to other colors (""blue,"" ""green,"" ""yellow,"" ""red"" respectively). There appears to be a direct word-to-color mapping.

Using this information, we can say that:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the output.
From the examples provided, we can start identifying patterns and formulating a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"". Let's break it down:

1. ""wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow"". The word ""wif"" seems to mean ""red"".

2. ""dax bluf zup bluf dax"" translates to ""green green yellow yellow green"". ""dax"" matches with ""green"" and ""bluf"" seems to be a redundant word as it does not appear in the output.

3. ""zup lug"" translates to ""yellow blue"". ""lug"" matches with ""blue"".

4. ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" translates to ""green green red yellow blue"". Following the same translation as before, ""dax"" is ""green"", ""wif"" is ""red"", and ""lug"" is ""blue""; ""bluf"" again seems redundant.

5. ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" translates to ""blue green yellow green green green red"". ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""dax"" is ""green"", ""wif"" is ""red"". The word ""walm"" translates to ""green"" and seems to have a similar function to ""dax"".

From these observations, we can derive the following rule:

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".

Therefore:

zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, we can infer that the word ""bluf"" represents a rule regarding the color that should follow it.

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" or ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow.""
3. When ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output before and after ""bluf"" is ""blue.""

To construct the general rule for ""bluf,"" let's extract patterns from each scenario:

- ""lug wif bluf"" results in ""blue red red,"" where ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" producing ""red.""
- ""zup lug bluf"" results in ""yellow blue blue,"" where ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" producing ""blue.""
- ""lug bluf zup"" results in ""blue blue yellow,"" where ""bluf"" precedes ""zup,"" producing ""yellow.""
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" results in ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue,"" where ""bluf"" is between ""zup"" and ""lug,"" producing ""yellow blue.""
- ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" results in ""green yellow blue yellow yellow,"" where ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" producing ""yellow.""

The patterns suggest that ""bluf"" takes on a color rule that is dependent on the word that either immediately precedes or follows it. The rule seems to be:

- If ""bluf"" comes after ""lug,"" the color is ""blue.""
- If ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" or ""zup,"" the color is ""yellow,"" regardless of what follows ""bluf.""

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the word immediately preceding it. If ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output color is ""blue."" If ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" or ""zup,"" the output color is ""yellow.""
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. The rule seems to be that ""walm"" takes the color coded by the previous word and replicates it in the output three times. Here is the correspondence from the examples provided:

- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue,"" hence ""lug"" codes for ""blue.""
- ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green,"" so ""dax"" codes for ""green.""
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" outputs ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue,"" which suggests ""wif"" codes for ""red,"" ""zup"" codes for ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" does not convert to anything since it does not precede ""walm,"" and ""lug"" still codes for ""blue.""
- ""lug wif dax walm zup"" outputs ""blue red green green green yellow,"" which further supports these color associations, with ""zup"" at the end not affecting the outcome since it does not precede ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Takes the color associated with the word immediately before it and outputs it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
Rule: dax -> green 

Evidence for the rule comes from each example:

- Whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the color ""green"" is included in the output.
- If ""dax"" appears multiple times, ""green"" is repeated in the output the same number of times as ""dax"" appears.

Individual examples can be broken down as follows:

- Input: dax
  Output: green
  - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

- Input: wif dax zup dax
  Output: red green yellow green
  - ""dax"" appears twice and corresponds to ""green"" each time.
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
  - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

- Input: dax walm
  Output: green green green
  - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
  - ""walm"" is not directly translated to a color which suggests that it might either determine the color repetition or have no direct color association; considering the output, it might mean ""repeat the previous color"", which in this case, causes ""green"" to repeat twice more since ""dax"" precedes it.

- Input: zup dax
  Output: yellow green
  - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
  - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

- Input: dax wif dax
  Output: green red green
  - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", which is consistent with the second example.

Therefore, the consistent interpretation of ""dax"" in this context is that it represents the color ""green"".
Based on the provided examples, we will analyze each instance of ""wif"" and the corresponding output to deduce its meaning. 

1. ""zup wif zup dax"" corresponds to ""yellow red yellow green"". 
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", so ""wif"" in this case corresponds to ""red"".

2. ""wif dax zup dax"" corresponds to ""red green yellow green"". 
   - Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and the first word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

3. ""dax walm wif walm"" corresponds to ""green green green red red red"".
   - Here, ""dax"" and ""walm"" repeat with the outputs ""green green"" and ""red red"" respectively, so ""wif"" in the context before ""walm"" causes the color to repeat once, maintaining the color ""red"".

4. ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" corresponds to ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"".
   - Each instance of ""wif"" is followed by ""red"", ""walm"" follows the pattern of repetition, and ""zup"" is consistent with ""yellow"". ""lug"" is introduced here as ""blue"".

5. ""wif dax zup wif"" corresponds to ""red green yellow red"".
   - Once again ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and both instances of ""wif"" correspond to ""red"".

Given the consistent appearance of ""red"" following each instance of ""wif"", alongside other words translating to other colors without interruption, it seems reasonable to conclude that ""wif"" is directly translated to ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in each example.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns in the inputs and outputs:

1. ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" -> ""blue red blue green green""
2. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
3. ""lug dax bluf"" -> ""blue green green""
4. ""lug bluf wif"" -> ""blue blue red""
5. ""zup bluf dax"" -> ""yellow yellow green""

It appears that ""bluf"" results in a repeat of the color that comes before it. We can see that that the color before ""bluf"" is repeated again in the output sequence. For example, in input 1, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and the output is ""green green"" after ""bluf."" In input 2, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow"" with ""bluf."" This pattern is consistent throughout all the examples.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat of the previous color.
Based on the given examples, the rule for walm appears to be related to outputting a series of colors that follow a pattern determined by the preceding words. However, in each case where ""walm"" is present, the output changes and is not immediately obvious based on the surrounding words alone. Therefore, ""walm"" might be enforcing a transformation on the output pattern.

Let's look more closely:

- In the case where ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", the output is a triplet of ""green.""
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" with no other word, the output is a triplet of ""blue.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax lug,"" there are additional colors (""blue blue"") in the output, and when it follows ""lug dax,"" there are additional colors ""yellow yellow.""
- When it is at the end of a sequence such as ""dax walm,"" it results in only three ""green"" colors.

It's difficult to deduce a specific and consistent rule for ""walm"" given there is a bit of variation when ""walm"" appears in different contexts. However, we can observe that the immediate presence of ""walm"" after ""dax"" or ""lug"" seems to lead to a triplet of colors corresponding to the word that came right before it (""dax"" -> green, ""lug"" -> blue).

With the given data, one might assume ""walm"" is a rule to repeat the color associated with the last word before ""walm"" three times. Yet, the example where ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" seems to break this pattern, as it results in ""green green green red"" instead of just repeating greens. Also, the position of ""walm"" seems to modify the outcome when it is in the middle or end of the sequence.

Rule: ""walm"" -> The presence of ""walm"" seems to enforce a repetition rule of the last color associated with the preceding word and might impact subsequent colors, but there is insufficient consistent data to determine an exact rule without further examples.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug
    ",Output: red blue,red blue,True,174
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the outputs.
Rule: dax -> green

The examples show that whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. The other words in the input are consistently translated to the same colors in the output as well, confirming that ""dax"" consistently means ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, wif consistently corresponds to the color red in the output. Each instance of the word ""wif"" in the input is translated to ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position or the surrounding words.

Thus, the rule is:
wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:
zup -> yellow

Meaning: Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the output should include the color ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each nonce word corresponds to a color. The word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: bluf -> green.
Based on the given examples, it can be deduced that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times. Each time ""walm"" appears in the input, the preceding color word's output is replicated three times.

Let's break down each example to understand the rule:

1. ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow."" Zup is associated with yellow, and because of walm, it is repeated three times.

2. ""dax walm zup walm"" leads to ""green green green yellow yellow yellow."" Here, dax is associated with green and is followed by walm causing the output of green to be repeated thrice—similarly, zup is associated with yellow and is followed by walm causing the output of yellow to be repeated thrice.

3. ""dax lug walm"" leads to ""green blue blue blue."" Dax is green, but it is not immediately followed by walm, so it's not repeated. Lug is blue and is followed by walm, resulting in blue being outputted three times.

4. ""zup bluf wif walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow red red red."" Zup is yellow but is not followed directly by walm, so it's not repeated. Bluf seems to have no outcome, possibly due to an error. Wif is associated with red and is followed by walm, causing red to be outputted three times.

5. The last example is a repetition of the first, ""zup walm,"" leading to ""yellow yellow yellow"" and confirming the rule derived from the first instance.

Rule: The word ""walm"" triggers the preceding color word's output to be tripled.

Thus:

walm -> causes the preceding color word's output to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm
    ",Output: green green green,green green green,True,175
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it seems that each word corresponds to a color.

From the examples given:

- lug consistently translates to blue.
- Other words: dax -> green, zup -> yellow, wif -> red, bluf -> blue, and walm -> blue, where walm seems to repeat the color output equal to the number of times walm appears.

Rule:
lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the output color changes depending on the position of the word in the sequence relative to the first occurrence of ""dax."" Here's what we can deduce:

- The first occurrence of ""dax"" is always translated to ""green.""
- Subsequent to the first ""dax,"" words seem to generate a color output following a specific pattern, regardless of the actual word. Repeated words do not change their output color unless separated by the word ""dax.""

Let's analyze the sequences:

1. ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" becomes ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow.""
   - After ""dax"" (green), we get a pattern: red, red, red, followed by different colors (blue, yellow). The repeated word ""walm"" does not affect the pattern, remaining the same color.

2. ""dax zup bluf"" becomes ""green yellow yellow.""
   - ""dax"" is ""green,"" followed by ""yellow"" for both ""zup"" and ""bluf,"" indicating that the first word after ""dax"" and the words following are ""yellow"".

3. ""dax zup"" becomes ""green yellow.""
   - The pattern maintains with ""dax"" as ""green"" followed by ""zup"" translated as ""yellow.""

4. ""dax"" alone is just ""green.""
   - This confirms that ""dax"" by itself is associated with ""green.""

5. ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" becomes ""green green red yellow green.""
   - The second ""dax"" repeats the color ""green"" associated with the first occurrence of ""dax."" 
   - Between the two ""dax"" instances, the pattern seems to start over, with ""bluf"" being translated to ""green"" rather than continuing the pattern from before.

The rule underlying these examples is not entirely clear, but we can deduce:

- ""dax"" is always associated with ""green.""
- After a ""dax,"" there might be a pattern to the colors that is reset once ""dax"" appears again.

Rule:
dax -> green
Following ""dax,"" the color pattern resets, but the pattern itself (what colors follow after ""dax"") is not entirely clear based on the examples provided. It is possible that each unique word following ""dax"" before it is repeated or another ""dax"" appears is assigned a consistent color, but we need more examples to establish a definitive rule.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's look at each example and see where ""wif"" appears and what word follows (if applicable) in the output:

1. Input: zup wif lug wif | Output: yellow red blue red
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   The first ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   The second ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red""

2. Input: zup wif dax | Output: yellow red green
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

3. Input: wif zup lug | Output: red yellow blue
   The first ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

4. Input: zup wif bluf | Output: yellow red red
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" (notice that it does not correspond to a new color, but repeats ""red"" from ""wif"")

5. Input: lug wif dax wif | Output: blue red green red
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   Another ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Based on these examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input or the words around it. Therefore, we can deduce that:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" represents the color red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Regardless of its position in the sequence, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow.""
Rule: bluf -> blue
Based on the given examples, walm seems to be associated with repetition of the color that comes before it. When a color word is mentioned before walm, the output repeats that color as many times as the initial letter repeats in the color word. If we examine each instance:

1. ""zup wif walm"" outputs ""yellow red red red"". The word ""wif"" refers to the color red, and since ""walm"" comes after it, and ""w"" repeats three times in ""wwwalm"", red is repeated three times in the output.

2. ""dax lug wif walm"" outputs ""green blue red red red"". The word ""wif"" again refers to the color red and is followed by ""walm"", which causes red to be repeated thrice as in the first example.

3. ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green"". Here, ""dax"" refers to the color green, and ""walm"" follows, which causes green to be outputted thrice, since ""w"" is tripled in ""walm"".

4. ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red"". Again, ""wif"" refers to the color red and is immediately followed by ""walm"", resulting in the red color being repeated thrice due to the triple ""w"" in ""walm"".

Therefore, regardless of the nonce word preceding ""walm"", the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the preceding color to repeat as many times as the first letter of ""walm"" appears in the word.

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the preceding color word in the output the number of times the first letter of ""walm"" (w) is repeated in the nonce word ""walm"". In the examples given, this is three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,176
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

The examples consistently show that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
dax -> green

Rule: The word 'dax' corresponds to the color green.
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""wif"" by examining its usage and the corresponding output in each case.

1. In the first example, the sequence ""dax wif lug dax"" translates to ""green red blue green."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"" both times it appears, and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". In this scenario, ""wif"" is the only word that translates to ""red"".

2. In the second input, ""wif"" yields ""green"" right before ""bluf,"" which corresponds to a double ""red,"" but we must note that ""dax"" which we know to translate to ""green"" precedes ""wif"" this time. And the entire sequence before ""wif"" is made up of unique words all translating to ""yellow"".

3. In the third input, ""wif"" occurs before ""walm,"" and both translate to ""red"". Yet this conflicts with the previously implied rule that ""wif"" directly translates to ""red,"" since ""wif"" here results in ""red red red,"" not just a single ""red"".

4. The fourth input also contains ""wif"" at the beginning and in the middle of the sequence. Both occurrences of ""wif"" translate to ""red,"" while ""dax"" and ""zup"" maintain their earlier translations of ""green"" and ""yellow,"" respectively.

5. In the last example, ""wif"" again translates to ""red,"" following ""dax"" (green) and ""bluf"" (green again).

Given the discrepancies and context, a possible rule can be deduced: ""wif"" likely means ""red,"" but context affects the output when ""wif"" appears (as seen in the second and third examples). However, without further context or rules guiding the changes between examples, it is not entirely clear why ""wif"" sometimes generates additional repetitions of ""red"".

Rule: ""wif"" generally corresponds to ""red,"" with some contextual variations that are not fully explained by the provided examples.
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to associate each nonce word with a distinct color:

- ""lug"" always corresponds to the output ""blue.""
- ""wif"" always corresponds to the output ""red.""
- ""dax"" always corresponds to the output ""green.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow"" in every instance it appears.

Considering these consistent correlations, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to translate to a repetition of the color output that immediately precedes it.

Here is the breakdown of the examples provided:

1. ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" translates to ""red yellow yellow red green"". Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"", which is the color that comes right before it.
 
2. ""wif lug bluf"" translates to ""red blue blue"". Again, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"", the color that comes right before it.

3. ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" translates to ""red green yellow red green green"". Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"", which is the color that comes right before it.

4. ""wif walm lug bluf"" translates to ""red red red blue blue"". In this example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"", repeating the previous color.

5. ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow"". Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"", the color that comes right before it.

Rule: bluf -> repetition of the previous color in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat three times, and that color is determined by the word that precedes ""walm"". Here is a breakdown of the examples provided:

1. ""zup walm"" results in “yellow yellow yellow”. 
   ""zup"" correlates with a single ""yellow"" output.

2. ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" results in “yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red”.
   Following the rule from the first example, after ""zup walm"" there are three yellows. 
   ""dax"" then correlates with ""green"", and ""wif"" with ""red"".

3. ""lug wif walm"" results in “blue red red red”.
   ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"", and ""wif"" correlates with ""red"". 
   The rule for ""walm"" following ""wif"" leads to ""red"" being output three times.

4. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" results in “blue red green yellow yellow yellow”.
   Following the established correlations, after ""zup"" and ""walm"", there are three yellows.

5. ""lug walm"" results in “blue blue blue”.
   ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"", and ""walm"" causes the color to repeat three times.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif walm lug
    ",Output: red red red blue,red red red blue,True,177
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" can be inferred by looking at its corresponding output color in each case:

- zup wif lug dax -> yellow red blue green
- dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
- lug dax lug -> blue green blue
- dax zup lug wif zup -> green yellow blue red yellow
- lug zup -> blue yellow

In every instance where the word ""lug"" appears, the corresponding output is the color ""blue."" Therefore, it can be deduced that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the outputs.

Rule: lug -> blue
Analyzing the examples, we can notice the following:

1. ""dax lug wif walm"" corresponds to ""green blue red red red.""
2. ""dax wif"" corresponds to ""green red.""
3. ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" corresponds to ""green red green yellow yellow.""
4. ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" corresponds to ""red green red red yellow red.""
5. ""wif dax"" corresponds to ""red green.""

In each instance, ""dax"" results in the word ""green.""

Given this pattern across all examples, we can deduce the following rule:
dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following rules for the nonce word ""wif"" and its association with colors in the output:

1. Every instance of the input that starts with ""wif"" leads to the output starting with ""red"". This indicates that ""wif"" directly translates to or triggers the color ""red"" in the output.

2. When ""wif"" is followed by other words, each subsequent word seems to be associated with a different color:

- ""walm"" leads to ""green"" (seen in the first and third examples).
- ""lug"" leads to ""blue"" (seen in the second example).
- ""dax"" leads to ""green"" when it follows ""walm"" and ""blue"" (as seen in the third example), but ""green"" when it directly follows ""wif"" (as seen in the first and second examples). It's important to note the difference in the number of ""green"" colors output when ""walm"" precedes ""dax""; this suggests that the occurrence of ""green"" after ""walm"" may be based on the number of syllables in ""walm"" (in this case, one syllable equates to one additional ""green"").
- ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"" (seen in the fourth example).

3. The repetition of a word seems to repeat its associated color in the output. For instance, ""lug"" appears twice in the second example and its color ""blue"" appears twice in the output.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" directly correlates to ""red"" at the start of an output sequence, and any words following it have a corresponding color that repeats as many times as the word occurs in the input.

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" we need to look at the patterns in which it appears and the corresponding outputs.

The outputs are sequences of colors. Let's examine the position of ""zup"" in the inputs and the corresponding outputs.

1. zup wif -> yellow red
   Here, ""zup"" precedes ""wif"" which leads to ""yellow"" followed by ""red.""

2. lug walm zup -> blue blue blue yellow
   ""zup"" follows ""lug"" and ""walm"" which are translated to ""blue blue blue"" and then ""yellow"" follows.

3. wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   ""zup"" follows ""wif walm dax"" which corresponds to ""red red red green,"" and after ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" followed by the sequence for ""wif lug walm.""

4. dax zup walm wif walm -> green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   ""zup"" follows ""dax"" which translates to ""green,"" then comes ""yellow,"" and after that, the sequence for ""walm wif walm.""

5. dax walm zup lug -> green green green yellow blue
   ""zup"" is between ""dax walm"" which corresponds to ""green green green"" and ""lug"" which leads to ""blue,"" with ""yellow"" in between these sequences.

From these examples, we can see that whenever ""zup"" is present, ""yellow"" appears in the output precisely at the position where ""zup"" is in the input. Each other input word corresponds to a specific color (""wif"" to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""walm"" to ""green,"" and ""dax"" to ""green""), but ""zup"" aligns with ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow

So the meaning of ""zup"" based on the given examples is that it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output sequence.
Based on the provided examples, bluf seems to correspond to a specific color each time it appears in the input. By comparing the input with its corresponding output, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule for bluf.

Here's the analysis:

- In the first example, the word ""bluf"" results in the color ""green"" appearing twice in the output, suggesting that bluf means ""green.""

- However, in the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by the color ""red."" This suggests that bluf might not always be the same color and its meaning could depend on context, or there might be another word affecting the output.

- The third example has ""bluf"" resulting in ""blue,"" which contradicts the first two instances where it seemed to mean ""green"" and ""red.""

- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""bluf"" once again corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Given that three out of the five examples show bluf corresponding to the color ""blue,"" while the first example deviates from this pattern by indicating ""green"" and the second example indicates ""red,"" let's look for a consistent rule:

Analyzing further, it appears that ""bluf"" may correspond to the color mentioned directly before it or assume the value of the last mentioned color. In the second example, however, this rule is broken.

Let's reassess our observations.

- The direct repetition of a word (like in ""wif wif"" or ""dax wif"") leads to a repetition of the corresponding color in the output.
- The word ""bluf"" consistently follows a color word except in the second example. However, let’s note the sequence of words in the first example ""bluf wif"" results in ""green red,"" while ""wif bluf"" in the second retains the color ""red,"" and not ""green,"" which could indicate that ""bluf"" might mimic the color word before it, except when it comes after ""wif,"" where it remains ""red"".

This leads to a complex rule that might not be entirely consistent based on the provided data. However, a potential rule could be:

Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue,"" except when it immediately follows ""wif,"" in which case the output is ""red."" 

Therefore, the definition could be stated as:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: ""blue,"" except when following ""wif,"" in which case the meaning is ""red.""
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare each input that contains the word ""walm"" and their corresponding outputs.

1. zup walm dax -> yellow yellow yellow green
2. dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue blue yellow red
3. lug wif walm -> blue red red red
4. lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
5. dax walm zup -> green green green yellow

Looking at the patterns, when ""walm"" is present, the color that follows its appearance in the output sequence is repeated until a different non-""walm"" word is encountered in the input. For example:

- In the first input, ""zup walm dax,"" ""walm"" is followed by three ""yellow,"" and then the word ""dax"" changes the output color to ""green.""
- In the second input, ""dax lug walm zup wif,"" ""walm"" precedes a sequence of ""blue,"" which continues until ""zup,"" which changes the output to ""yellow,"" followed by ""wif,"" changing the output to ""red.""
- In the third input, ""lug wif walm,"" ""walm"" comes after ""lug wif"" and the output shows two ""red,"" which suggests that the effect of ""walm"" is the repetition of ""red.""
- In the fourth input, ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug,"" after the appearance of ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times until ""lug"" is encountered again.
- In the fifth input, ""dax walm zup,"" ""walm"" is again followed by a repetition of ""green"" before ""zup"" changes the color.

From these observations, we can induce that the word ""walm"" causes the next color in the sequence to be repeated until a new non-""walm"" word appears.

Rule: walm -> causes the next word's associated color to be repeated until a new non-""walm"" word appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: dax -> green. 

Whenever the word 'dax' appears in the input, it translates to the color 'green' in the output.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the color ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output. The other words appear to correspond to different colors; for example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" seems to correspond to ""red"" followed by ""red"" for each additional occurrence, and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""zup"" designates the color yellow, irrespective of its position in the sequence.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns in the input and their corresponding output:

1. In the first example, ""zup wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow red red."" Since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" we can deduce that ""bluf"" might also correspond to ""red.""

2. In the second example, ""lug bluf wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue red."" Here, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" so again ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""

3. In the third example, ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red red green blue blue."" Following the previously deduced meanings, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" Here we see ""bluf"" after a ""wif"" results in ""red,"" and ""bluf"" after a ""lug"" results in ""blue.""

4. In the fourth example, ""zup lug bluf wif"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue red."" We can confirm that ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red."" Here, ""bluf"" following ""lug"" is ""blue"" again.

5. In the fifth example, ""wif dax bluf"" corresponds to ""red green green."" We have ""wif"" as ""red,"" ""dax"" as ""green."" Following the pattern, ""bluf"" would be ""green"" after ""dax.""

From these examples, it seems ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it. If it comes after ""zup,"" it would be ""yellow""; after ""lug,"" it would be ""blue""; after ""wif,"" it would be ""red""; and after ""dax,"" it would be ""green.""

Rule: bluf -> the color of the word that precedes it.
walm -> meaning. Meaning is the repetition of the color word that precedes it. 

Rule: When walm follows a color-coded word (e.g., 'dax' for green, 'wif' for red, 'lug' for blue, 'zup' for yellow), it causes the output to repeat the color associated with that word three more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the context provided by the input and output examples, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. Here is the analysis leading to this conclusion:

- Input: lug dax lug
  Output: blue green blue
  ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" both times it appears.

- Input: zup dax lug
  Output: yellow green blue
  Here ""lug"" is at the end and corresponds to ""blue"".

- Input: wif zup lug wif
  Output: red yellow blue red
  The word ""lug"" appears third in the sequence and translates to ""blue"".

- Input: dax lug zup dax
  Output: green blue yellow green
  In this sequence, ""lug"" is the second word and is represented as ""blue"".

- Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
  Output: red red green green red red red blue red
  ""lug"" is the seventh word in the sequence and corresponds to ""blue"", with all other non-""lug"" words matched to their respective colors.

From the patterns observed above, it is clear that ""lug"" independently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words. Thus, the rule is:

Rule:
lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning of the word ""dax"" by looking at the input and corresponding output patterns:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""dax"", the output is ""red green"".
- When ""dax"" precedes ""wif"" and ""walm"", the output starts with ""green"" and is followed by a series of ""red"".
- When ""zup"" precedes ""wif"" and ""dax walm"", the output is ""yellow red"" followed by a series of ""green"".
- When ""dax"" precedes ""lug"" and is followed by ""wif"", the output is ""green blue red"".
- When ""dax"" precedes ""lug"" and is followed by another ""dax"", the output is ""green"" followed by ""blue"" then another ""green"".

From these patterns, we can surmise the following rules about ""dax"":
- ""dax"" when appearing first in the input seems to translate to ""green"" in the output.
- The output color sequence is influenced by the position of ""dax"" and the words around it—whether ""dax"" directly follows another word or is followed by another word (for example, ""lug"").

Given that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" every time it appears in the input, regardless of its position, we can deduce a rule for ""dax"":

Rule: dax -> green

However, it is important to note that additional context or examples might be needed to fully understand if there are any more complex rules or exceptions governing the use of the word ""dax"".
Based on the provided examples, I can deduce the following:

1. Whenever the word ""wif"" appears on its own, the output is ""red.""
2. In the first example, ""wif"" appears twice and the output is ""red"" both times.
3. In the third example, ""wif"" is followed by ""zup"" and then by another ""wif,"" and the outputs are ""red,"" ""yellow,"" and ""red"" respectively. The word ""lug"" precedes the first ""wif,"" and ""lug"" also precedes a ""wif"" in the first example, where its output is ""blue.""
4. In the fourth example, ""wif"" on its own once again produces ""red.""
5. In the fifth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""zup"" and later followed by ""wif,"" yielding outputs ""red"" and ""yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" yields double ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" yields ""green.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""wif"" is consistent, and it seems to always correspond to the output ""red."" The meaning of ""wif"" does not appear to change regardless of the context in which it is used, as it always produces the same output when it is present.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" appears to be consistent across all examples. Whenever ""zup"" is present in the input, the output invariably includes the word ""yellow."" There are no examples where ""zup"" yields a different output. The other words in the inputs (""dax,"" ""walm,"" ""lug,"" ""wif"") appear to correspond to their own colors—green, green, blue, and red, respectively.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here is the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and when ""bluf"" follows, it also outputs ""red.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is two ""red""s again.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" for the third time, and the output is ""red"" repeated.
- The fourth example confirms that ""bluf"" is contingent on the word before it, as ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the ""bluf"" output is also ""yellow.""
- The fifth example strengthens the rule by showing ""bluf"" after ""wif"" and the output is ""red"" repeated as expected.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to stand for a repetition of the color word that precedes it, equal to the number of color words mentioned in the input before ""walm"". Reviewing the examples provided:

1. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow (There's only 'zup' which means yellow, so 'walm' repeats 'yellow' three times.)
   
2. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red (There are two colors 'zup' which means yellow and 'wif' which means red. Since 'wif' comes last, 'walm' repeats 'red' three times after the initial 'yellow'.)
   
3. lug wif walm -> blue red red red (Similar to example 2, two colors 'lug' and 'wif' imply blue and red. 'Red' is repeated three times after 'blue'.)
   
4. wif dax zup walm -> red green yellow yellow yellow (There are three colors 'wif', 'dax', and 'zup', meaning red, green, and yellow respectively. Since 'zup' comes last, 'walm' repeated the last mentioned color 'yellow' three times after 'red' and 'green'.)
   
5. zup wif dax walm lug -> yellow red green green green blue (There are three colors 'zup', 'wif', and 'dax', meaning yellow, red, and green respectively. Since 'dax' comes last before 'walm', 'green' is repeated three times before 'lug' which is blue.)

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is: walm repeats the last mentioned color word for a number of times equal to the total number of color words mentioned before it in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last mentioned color word based on the count of distinct preceding color words in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,180
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.
By examining the input/output pairs provided, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""dax"". Let's analyze the data:

1. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
2. ""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green""
3. ""dax zup lug wif lug"" -> ""green yellow blue red blue""
4. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" -> ""yellow red green green green blue""
5. ""dax bluf wif lug"" -> ""green green red blue""

Considering the outputs when the word ""dax"" appears and the corresponding word ""green"", we can observe that the word ""dax"" consistently leads to the output color ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. The word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present. Therefore, we can deduce the meaning of ""wif"" as follows:

wif -> meaning: red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in each example.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of the context in which it appears.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to represent a color that changes depending on the word it follows.

Here are the patterns I've observed:
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""
- The word ""bluf"" itself doesn't have a single color associated with it but instead takes on the color associated with the preceding word.

Given these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word preceding it.

- ""zup bluf"" becomes ""yellow yellow""
- ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red""
- ""dax bluf"" becomes ""green green""
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we analyze the input-output pairs:

- In the first and fourth examples, ""dax lug walm"" outputs ""green blue blue blue."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" might correspond to repeating the color that immediately precedes it, hence ""blue blue blue.""

- In the second example, ""zup wif walm"" outputs ""yellow red red red."" Here ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" Based on our initial hypothesis, ""walm"" would again correspond to repeating the color that precedes it, which is ""red red red.""

- In the third example, ""dax walm wif dax"" outputs ""green green green red green."" Since ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""wif"" to red, the input ""walm"" following the first ""dax"" resulted in two more ""green"" colors before the ""wif"" (red) and then another ""dax"" (green). This is consistent with the idea that ""walm"" repeats the previous color an additional three times.

- In the fifth example, ""wif lug walm"" outputs ""red blue blue blue."" Here ""wif"" corresponds to red and ""lug"" to blue. We can see that ""lug"" (blue) is followed by ""walm,"" which again leads to the color of ""lug"" being repeated three times, which confirms our hypothesis.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" means to repeat the color that immediately precedes it three times.

Hence:
walm -> repeat the previous color three times

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup lug walm zup lug
    ",Output: yellow blue blue blue yellow blue,yellow blue blue blue yellow blue,True,181
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can observe the following:

1. ""zup dax lug"" translates to ""yellow green blue""
2. ""lug wif"" translates to ""blue red""
3. ""dax walm zup lug"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue""
4. ""zup lug dax"" translates to ""yellow blue green""
5. ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow""

From these examples, we deduce the following individual word mappings:

- ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green""
- ""lug"" appears to consistently map to ""blue""

Thus, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" is:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be:

Whenever the input contains the word ""dax,"" the output is ""green."" 

Therefore:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Thus, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word 'zup' corresponds with the color 'yellow.' Every instance of 'zup' in the input results in 'yellow' in the output. There is no evidence from the given examples that 'zup' changes its meaning depending on context. It is consistently translated to 'yellow' irrespective of the position in the sequence or the surrounding words.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" is a repeater for the color word that comes directly before it in the sequence. Here's the analysis for each input:

1. dax lug bluf wif → green blue blue red
   ""lug"" is followed by ""bluf"", and the output for ""lug"" is ""blue"". In the output, ""blue"" is repeated once more before moving on to ""wif"", which translates to ""red"".

2. wif bluf → red red
   ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"", and the output for ""wif"" is ""red"". In the output, ""red"" is repeated.

3. zup wif bluf → yellow red red
   ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"", and the output for ""wif"" is ""red"". In the output, ""red"" is repeated.

4. wif bluf → red red
   This is the same as the second input, reinforcing the pattern that ""wif"" yields ""red"" and ""bluf"" repeats the previous color.

5. zup dax bluf → yellow green green
   ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"", and the output for ""dax"" is ""green"". In the output, ""green"" is repeated.

Therefore, the rule induced here is:
bluf -> Repeats the color of the word prior to it in the input.

Rule: If a word is followed by ""bluf"", the output will repeat the color corresponding to that word.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the examples provided. Initially, we can note the corresponding colors for each word, other than ""walm,"" and look for consistency in their appearances:

- ""wif"" appears to consistently correspond to ""red.""
- ""dax"" appears to consistently correspond to ""green.""
- ""zup"" appears to consistently correspond to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue"" but requires further scrutiny.

Now, let’s analyze the context in which ""walm"" appears and its corresponding output color:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""red red red green yellow.""
2. In the second example, it is preceded by ""yellow"" and followed by ""yellow yellow blue red.""
3. In the third example, it is preceded by ""green"" and followed by ""green red.""
4. In the fourth example, it comes after ""blue blue yellow blue"" and is followed by nothing.
5. In the fifth example, it is followed by ""red red red.""

From these examples, we notice that after ""walm"" is used, the following word (if there's one) corresponds to ""red"" except when ""walm"" is the last word, in which case there is no color output after it. This observation suggests that ""walm"" may require examining the word after it to determine its corresponding color. Given the information and looking through the examples:

- When ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" (which corresponds to ""green""), the output is ""red red red green"".
- When ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red""), the output is ""red red red red"".
- When ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue""), the output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue"".

It seems that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color corresponding to the word following ""walm."" However, it doesn't do this when it's the last word, implying that its effect is contingent on it being followed by another word.

With these observations, we can propose the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color output corresponding to the next word (if there is one) three times before the actual color for the following word is presented. When ""walm"" is the last word, it adds no color output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup dax wif
    ",Output: green yellow green red,green yellow green red,True,182
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" is presented in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position or the other words surrounding it.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" can be deduced as follows:

- Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.
- The presence of ""wif"" does not change the output for other words; each of them has a corresponding color in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the patterns observed in the provided examples, it appears that each time the nonce word ""zup"" is present in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output.

Examples to support the rule:
- ""zup wif"" corresponds to ""yellow red"", with ""zup"" translating to ""yellow"".
- ""dax zup lug"" results in ""green yellow blue"", with ""zup"" again translating to ""yellow"".
- Consistent with the rule, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" in all subsequent examples.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" results in repeating the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. For instance:

- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"", indicating ""bluf"" has repeated the color output for ""wif.""
- ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" results in ""green green red yellow red,"" showing that ""bluf"" again repeated the color for ""dax.""
- ""zup bluf lug"" outputs ""yellow yellow blue,"" once again repeating the color for ""zup"" due to ""bluf.""
- ""wif bluf lug zup"" gives us ""red red blue yellow,"" with ""bluf"" repeating the color for ""wif.""
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow red red red,"" where ""bluf"" has repeated ""zup's"" color.

Therefore, the rule induced from the examples could be stated as:

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word three times.

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue blue"". Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" and we see that ""walm"" causes the color ""blue"" to be repeated three times.
  
- In the second example, ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red."" After ""wif,"" which translates to ""red,"" ""walm"" leads to ""red"" being repeated three times.

- In the third example, ""lug walm wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue red."" Again, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times.

- In the fourth example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" leads to ""yellow"" being repeated three times.

- In the fifth example, ""dax walm zup walm"" translates to ""green green green yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated three times. After that, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" again causes the preceding color, ""yellow,"" to be repeated three times. 

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is to repeat the color signified by the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
After reviewing the examples provided, the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position or repetition within the input. This direct and consistent correlation allows us to deduce the meaning of ""lug.""

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time the word ""dax"" is present in the input, the word ""green"" is present in the output. However, the presence of other words in conjunction with ""dax"" seems to generate additional colors:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" repeated three times

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" is used in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding output, regardless of its position or the context it is used in.

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
Rule: zup -> yellow

Applying this rule to the examples:

Input: zup lug
Output: yellow blue
Explanation: 'zup' translates to 'yellow', and 'lug' seems to correspond to 'blue'.

Input: lug zup
Output: blue yellow
Explanation: 'lug' translates to 'blue', and 'zup' translates to 'yellow'.

Input: wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow
Explanation: Both 'wif' and 'walm' translate to 'red' three times, followed by 'zup', which translates to 'yellow'.

Input: dax zup walm wif walm
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
Explanation: 'dax' translates to 'green', 'zup' to 'yellow', 'walm' to 'yellow', 'wif' to 'red', and then 'walm' repeats the 'red' for each subsequent occurrence.

Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
Output: green green red yellow red
Explanation: 'dax' translates to 'green', 'bluf' also seems to translate to 'green' (however, there's only one data point for 'bluf', so this is not certain), 'wif' translates to 'red', 'zup' to 'yellow', and the last 'wif' again translates to 'red'.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the mentioned examples and identify the circumstances where the word ""bluf"" appears and what output it corresponds to. Let's examine each example:

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   
   - Here ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

2. Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
   Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow
   
   - Here ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   
3. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   
   - Here ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

4. Input: wif lug bluf wif zup
   Output: red blue blue red yellow
   
   - Here ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""

5. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green
   
   - Here ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""

Upon inspecting our examples, we see that ""bluf"" doesn't consistently correspond to the same color. However, in each case, ""bluf"" outputs the color that comes immediately after it. If we apply this rule to all the instances of ""bluf"":

Input 1: ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue.""
Input 2: ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow.""
Input 3: ""bluf"" is followed by nothing, but ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"" is the last color mentioned before ""bluf.""
Input 4: ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red.""
Input 5: ""bluf"" is followed by nothing, but ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"" is the last color mentioned before ""bluf.""

It seems that ""bluf"" outputs the color that corresponds to the word that either immediately follows it or the last color mentioned previously (which is red in Input 3). Let's establish the rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" outputs the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately after it; if ""bluf"" is the last word, it outputs the color corresponding to the last word before it that has an established color association.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the relationship between the input and the output sequences. Each example has a corresponding color output, sometimes with repetitions. Let's inspect the patterns:

1. Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, the color in the output is repeated three times.
2. ""walm"" doesn't seem to have a fixed color associated with it. Instead, its color depends on the word before it:
    - After ""wif,"" the color is red (Example 1: ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"").
    - After ""lug,"" the color is blue (Example 2: ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""; Example 4: ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"").
    - After ""dax,"" the color is green (Example 3: ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"").
    - Its placement after ""wif"" and ""lug,"" regardless of their position relative to ""dax,"" still results in the same color (Example 4 and Example 5).

Let's compile the rule for ""walm"" based on these observations:

Rule:
walm -> The meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times. If the preceding word is ""wif,"" the color is red. If it is ""lug,"" the color is blue. If it is ""dax,"" the color is green.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm
    ",Output: green green green,green green green,True,184
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: In each example, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position or repetition in the input sequence.
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we examine the common elements and differences in each example, especially where ""dax"" appears.

- In every instance where ""dax"" is present, the word ""green"" is in the output.
- ""dax"" does not appear to be dependent on the position in the sequence as it yields ""green"" whether it is at the beginning, middle, or end.
- ""dax"" does not change with the presence of other words; it always corresponds to ""green.""

From these observations, the rule seems clear:

Rule: dax -> green

Each occurrence of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output, regardless of position or surrounding words.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that each instance of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Here's the justification according to each input:

1. Input: dax bluf wif zup
   Output: green green red yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

2. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" (though not enough information to definitively determine what ""walm"" maps to, we can assume ""wif"" remains consistent with ""red"")
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

3. Input: wif
   Output: red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

4. Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
   Output: blue red red green blue blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" here, but this is inconsistent with the first input, suggesting that ""bluf"" might change colors based on its position or context, or that there was a mistake in either this input or the first input.
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

5. Input: wif
   Output: red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Here is the rule deduction:

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look for patterns in the examples provided:

1. ""dax zup walm wif"" yields ""green yellow yellow yellow red""
2. ""zup walm wif"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow red""
3. ""wif bluf lug zup"" yields ""red red blue yellow""
4. ""zup lug zup dax"" yields ""yellow blue yellow green""
5. ""zup dax walm zup wif"" yields ""yellow green green green yellow red""

From the data provided, there are a few patterns observed:

- The presence of ""zup"" always results in the word ""yellow"" in the output.
- ""zup"" seems to not depend on its position in the input sequence for this transformation to ""yellow.""
- When ""zup"" follows ""dax,"" the output corresponding to ""dax"" is ""green,"" but ""dax's"" output can also be ""green"" when it is not preceded by ""zup"" (as seen in the fifth input). This suggests that the output for ""dax"" is not dependent on ""zup.""

Hence, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow,"" regardless of its position or the surrounding words. There are no apparent additional conditions affecting this transformation based on the examples provided.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Observing the pattern in the examples given, it appears that ""bluf"" is translated each time as either ""blue"" or ""yellow"". The decision rule isn't immediately obvious from the examples provided, as ""bluf"" doesn't consistently translate to the same color. However, examining the output more closely, it seems that ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" when preceded by ""lug"" and to ""yellow"" when preceded by any other word.

Let's test this hypothesis with the given examples:

1. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - Here, each occurrence of ""bluf"" after ""lug"" is translated to ""blue"".

2. Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
   - The ""bluf"" is not preceded by ""lug"", so it is translated to ""yellow"".

3. Input: zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow yellow blue
   - ""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" (not ""lug""), so it is ""yellow"".

4. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
   Output: red green red red yellow red
   - ""Bluf"" follows ""wif"" and is translated as ""red"". This doesn't fit our hypothesis, but looking closely, it looks like there's a typo in the output. Assuming it should be ""yellow"" instead of ""red"" after ""bluf"", our rule still stands.

5. Input: dax bluf wif zup
   Output: green green red yellow
   - ""Bluf"" follows ""dax"", so according to our rule, it should be ""yellow"". This fits.

Given this pattern, the rule seems to be:

If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"", it translates to ""blue""; otherwise, it translates to ""yellow"".

Rule: bluf -> ""blue"" if preceded by ""lug"", and ""yellow"" otherwise.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we must look at each example and see how the output changes when ""walm"" is present. 

- In the first example, ""wif walm dax"" corresponds to ""red red red green."" If we ignore ""walm"" for a moment, we can guess that ""wif"" might correspond to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" since the Output changes color when ""dax"" is introduced.
  
- The second example, ""zup walm,"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" There's no immediate way to deduce what ""zup"" or ""walm"" translates to based on this Output alone, but we can note that the presence of ""walm"" doesn't change the color.

- The third example, ""dax wif walm,"" outputs ""green red red red."" This is similar to our guess from the first example, where ""wif"" potentially corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" but then it all changes to red when ""walm"" is introduced.

- The fourth example shows that both ""lug"" and ""walm"" are present with ""bluf"" and ""wif."" The Output is ""blue blue red blue red red red blue."" Knowing that ""wif"" may correspond to ""red,"" and assuming that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" the addition of ""walm"" again changes the Output to reds after it appears.

- Finally, the fifth example, ""wif walm,"" and the Output is ""red red red,"" reinforces our earlier guess that ""wif"" is ""red."" Since ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" we can now surmise that ""walm"" may act as a modifier—in this instance, it turns all following colors to red, though the initial ""wif"" remains red.

Rule: walm -> turns all following color outputs to red.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup wif zup
    ",Output: yellow red yellow,yellow red yellow,True,185
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, ""lug"" seems to consistently translate to the color ""blue"". Each instance of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the position or surrounding words.

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we can compare the position of ""dax"" in each input to its corresponding color in the output:

1. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
2. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
3. lug dax lug -> blue green blue
4. zup walm dax lug -> yellow yellow yellow green blue
5. lug dax wif lug -> blue green red blue

Looking at the colors associated with ""dax,"" we can see that it is ""green"" in every instance where it appears. To confirm any positional rules, let’s look at contexts where ""dax"" is not present and see if green occurs:

1. None of the inputs without ""dax"" result in a green output.
2. ""Green"" appears only when ""dax"" is in the input.

Hence, it appears that the presence of ""dax"" directly corresponds to the output color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color red in each example given.
Based on the input-output pairs provided, I will deduce the meaning of the word ""zup"":

1. In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow.""
2. The second and third examples reinforce that ""zup"" alone corresponds to ""yellow.""
3. The fourth example indicates that ""zup"" still corresponds to ""yellow"" even when surrounded by other words.
4. The fifth example also supports that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input.

There is a consistent one-to-one correspondence between the word ""zup"" and the color ""yellow"" in every example. Other words in the inputs correspond to different colors, but ""zup"" consistently results in ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it seems that each word translates into a specific color. Given that the output has the same number of color words as the input has nonce words, it's likely that there is a direct mapping from nonce word to color word.

Here's the breakdown of the known words to their color based on the provided examples:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow

When looking at the position of 'bluf' in the input and the corresponding color in the output, it appears that 'bluf' consistently maps to the color 'red'.

So we have:

bluf -> red

Thus, the rule is:
Rule: bluf translates to the color red.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can examine how its presence affects the color output in each example.

- In all examples where ""walm"" is present, the word immediately after ""walm"" results in ""blue.""
- When ""walm"" is the second word in the sequence, such as ""lug walm dax,"" the word before ""walm"" also results in ""blue.""
- When ""walm"" is the first word in the sequence, such as ""walm zup,"" the word after ""walm"" results in ""red.""
- However, in the last example, ""lug walm"" does not yield ""blue red,"" so the previous conclusion isn't universally applicable.

Let's try a different approach:

- The output is composed of four colors: red, green, blue, and yellow.
- Every sequence containing ""walm"" has ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""walm.""
- When ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" ""red"" follows the first ""blue"" in the output.
- When ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" ""green"" follows the last ""blue"" in the output.
- “lug” always translates to ""blue,"" whether ""walm"" is in the sequence or not.

Based on these observations, the word ""walm"" seems to cause the following word to take on the color ""blue,"" but also maintains the original color attributed to that word if it were alone, as noted in the case with ""zup"" and ""dax,"" where ""red"" and ""green"" appear respectively following ""blue."" 

If we apply this logic consistently:

- ""wif walm zup"" outputs ""red red red yellow"" because ""wif"" is not followed by ""walm."" If ""walm"" turns the following word into ""blue"" and keeps the original color, ""zup"" would be ""yellow,"" but here it's ""red yellow.""
- ""dax lug walm"" outputs ""green blue blue blue"" because ""dax"" is not followed by ""walm,"" ""lug"" always translates to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes the following sequence to be ""blue"" as well.
- ""lug zup walm lug"" outputs ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"" because ""lug"" always translates to ""blue,"" ""zup"" turns into ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" keeps ""lug"" as ""yellow"" while following it by ""blue.""
- ""zup lug walm"" outputs ""yellow blue blue blue"" because ""zup"" is not followed by ""walm,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" follows by ""blue.""
- ""lug walm dax"" outputs ""blue blue blue green"" because ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" turns ""dax"" into ""blue"" first, followed by its original color of ""green.""

It appears the rule is as follows:
Rule: ""walm"" changes the following word to ""blue"" in the output sequence, but also keeps the original color of that word where applicable, thus potentially creating two colors in the sequence whenever ""walm"" precedes another word.

Hence, the rule interpretation:
walm -> changes following word's output to ""blue"" while also including the word's own color if not ""blue"" already.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,186
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"". Here's how that rule applies to each given example:

- In the first example, ""lug"" is surrounded by the word ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" The pattern ""dax lug bluf dax"" becomes ""green blue blue green,"" which shows that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and is consistent with the color pattern.

- In the second example, ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue,"" where again ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

- In the third example, the pattern of ""wif dax lug dax"" becomes ""red green blue green,"" and the ""lug"" is positioned between two instances of ""dax"" (green) and follows ""wif"" (red), indicating ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

- In the fourth example, the sequence ""lug wif bluf lug wif"" becomes ""blue red red blue red,"" which confirms ""lug"" as ""blue"" since ""bluf,"" representing ""red,"" is adjacent to it, but does not match it.

- Finally, in the fifth example, ""lug wif dax zup walm"" translates to ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow,"" further confirming ""lug"" as ""blue"" regardless of the position in the sequence and the different following word ""zup.""

Rule:
lug -> blue
To figure out what ""dax"" means within the provided examples, we can compare the outputs associated with sentences that contain ""dax"" versus those that do not.

In the outputs, ""green"" is consistently associated with ""dax,"" regardless of its position in the input:

1. Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax
   Output: green green yellow yellow green
   (Both occurrences of ""dax"" correspond to green)

2. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   (Again ""dax"" corresponds to green)

3. Input: zup dax
   Output: yellow green
   (""dax"" again corresponds to green)

4. Input: zup dax lug
   Output: yellow green blue
   (As before, ""dax"" is green)

5. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow green yellow green red red
   (Each ""dax"" is consistently green)

None of the other words (bluf, zup, lug, wif) consistently correspond with green in the outputs. This indicates that the word ""dax"" has a direct and consistent association to the color green.

Hence, the rule appears to be:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red'.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color that matches the color represented by the word before it. 

For instance:
- In ""lug bluf"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and then ""bluf"" also corresponds to blue.
- In ""wif bluf"", ""wif"" corresponds to red, and then ""bluf"" also corresponds to red.
- In ""dax zup lug bluf"", ""lug"" before ""bluf"" corresponds to blue, so ""bluf"" also corresponds to blue.

However, in the example of ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"", the color before ""bluf"" is ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow, but the output for ""bluf"" is yellow instead of blue. This might indicate a deviation from the previous observations where ""bluf"" mimicked the color represented by the word immediately before it. To consolidate this pattern, let's examine whether ""bluf"" always copies the color of the word right before it or whether it might be related to a specific word's color regardless of position. We notice that in all instances, ""bluf"" copies the color of ""lug"" if ""lug"" is in the string, except for the string where ""lug"" is not present (""wif bluf zup""), where ""bluf"" then copies the color of ""wif"".

However, in all examples given, ""bluf"" never actually translated to ""blue"" when following ""zup"", which suggests that ""zup"" might be an exception in the pattern. There's not enough data to conclude how ""bluf"" behaves after ""zup"" definitively, but it can be inferred that ""bluf"" likely represents the color of the last word that is not ""zup"". If ""zup"" is the word immediately preceding ""bluf"", then it mimics the color of the word before ""zup"".

Thus, based on the examples provided:

Rule: bluf -> the color word immediately before it except when preceded by ""zup"", in which case it represents the color of the word before ""zup"".

Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to correspond to a repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it. To confirm this, let's look at each input and output pair:

1. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" corresponds to ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue."" Here, ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the output has ""yellow"" repeated twice after ""zup.""

2. ""dax lug walm"" corresponds to ""green blue blue blue."" In this case, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and the output has ""blue"" repeated three times.

3. ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue."" Similarly, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which is ""blue,"" and the output has ""blue"" repeated three times.

4. ""zup lug walm wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue blue red red red."" Here, the first ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (""blue""), and we get ""blue"" repeated three times. The second ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (""red""), and we get ""red"" repeated three times.

5. Again, ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue,"" where ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (""blue""), resulting in ""blue"" repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the color word immediately before it to be repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup bluf
    ",Output: green yellow yellow,green yellow yellow,True,187
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it is possible to discern a pattern for the nonce word ""lug"" by comparing inputs and outputs. Here are the specific instances:

1. Whenever ""dax"" is input, the output contains ""green"".
2. Whenever ""walm"" is input, the output contains ""blue"".
3. ""zup"" correlates with the output ""yellow"".
4. ""wif"" correlates with the output ""red"".

By examining where ""lug"" appears and what color it translates to in the outputs, it's noticeable that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence or the other words present.

Thus, the rule can be determined as:
lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Whenever the input contains the word ""dax,"" the output includes ""green."" 

The presence of other words in the input does not seem to change the association between ""dax"" and ""green,"" but it does introduce other colors into the output. For instance, when ""wif"" is included in the input with ""dax,"" the output is ""green red,"" suggesting that ""wif"" may correspond to ""red."" Similarly, the inclusion of ""zup"" in the input results in ""yellow"" being part of the output, implying that ""zup"" could correspond to ""yellow.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the corresponding colors for each nonce word and then determine the rule for ""wif."" Let's break down each example:

1. lug walm wif bluf
   - Output: blue blue blue red red
   This suggests that ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color of the word that came before it, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" (despite its similarity to ""blue"") also corresponds to red.

2. wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   - Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   ""wif"" starts this sequence with red, followed by the repetition rule for ""walm."" ""dax"" gives green, ""zup"" gives yellow, ""wif"" again gives red, ""lug"" as previously thought is blue, and ""walm"" again follows the repetition rule. 

3. lug wif walm
   - Output: blue red red red
   ""lug"" is blue, ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" is a red repeating from ""wif.""

4. lug wif zup wif walm
   - Output: blue red yellow red red red
   Consistent with the previous examples, ""lug"" is blue, ""wif"" is red, ""zup"" is yellow, ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" continues the red.

5. zup dax wif
   - Output: yellow green red
   ""zup"" is yellow, ""dax"" is green, and ""wif"" is red.

The term ""wif"" consistently leads to the output ""red"" across all examples, regardless of position or other words present. Therefore, we can deduce that:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that:

- wif corresponds with red
- dax corresponds with green
- zup corresponds with yellow
- bluf corresponds with yellow
- lug corresponds with blue

Given that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence, we can deduce the following rule:

zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look closer at the input-output pairs to identify any patterns:

1. ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup"" (first input-output pair).
2. ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" when preceded by ""wif"" (second and fifth input-output pairs).
3. ""bluf"" corresponds to a repeated color when it occurs twice in the input (fifth input-output pair).

There are insufficient examples to make a definitive rule about ""bluf"" without more context. However, if we focus on the repetition of ""bluf"" in the last example and its resulting output, we can see that there might be a pattern of ""bluf"" taking on the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

With this in mind, let's see if this rule fits all the examples:

- Input: zup bluf dax
  Output: yellow yellow green
  Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" thus ""bluf"" becomes ""yellow"" here.

- Input: wif bluf lug zup
  Output: red red blue yellow
  Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" thus ""bluf"" becomes ""red"" here.

- Input: zup wif bluf zup
  Output: yellow red red yellow
  Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" thus ""bluf"" becomes ""red"" here.

- Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
  Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
  Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" thus ""bluf"" becomes ""yellow"" here.

- Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
  Output: red red green green red red red blue red
  Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" thus the first ""bluf"" becomes ""red""; the second instance of ""bluf"" is preceded immediately by ""dax,"" but this breaks the rule since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and the second ""bluf"" in the sequence does not. It seems to maintain the previous color unless the word immediately before it signifies a color, in which case it defaults to ""red.""

From the above, we can induce that the rule may be as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" generally takes on the color indicated by the word immediately preceding it, unless that word is a new color indicator starting with ""dax"" in which case ""bluf"" maintains the color before the new indicator.

However, due to the limited data, this rule may not be exhaustive or entirely accurate. It's the best we can do with the given examples, and more data would be needed to refine this rule further.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word just before ""walm."" So, in the context provided:

- ""dax lug wif walm"" outputs ""green blue red red red,"" and since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""walm"" causes a repetition of ""red.""
- ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" outputs ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red,"" and directly before ""walm"" we have ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""walm"" repeats ""yellow.""
- ""zup walm wif"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" where ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" results in repeating ""yellow.""
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" outputs ""red red green green green,"" where ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and thus ""walm"" repeats ""green.""
- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" which is again repeated.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""walm"" causes repetition of the color that is associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: walm -> causes repetition of the preceding color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.
From the examples provided, it appears that each word corresponds to a color:

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- walm -> repetition of the preceding color

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in each example provided.
Based on the given examples, the word 'zup' consistently translates to the color 'yellow'. Therefore, the rule I can deduce is:

zup -> yellow

Rule: 'zup' means 'yellow'.
Based on the given examples, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to involve repeating the color word that appears immediately before ""bluf."" Here's how the rule applies to the examples provided:

- ""lug bluf"" becomes ""blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""zup bluf"" becomes ""yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" becomes ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue"" where ""dax bluf"" turns into ""green green"" and ""zup bluf"" turns into ""yellow yellow.""
- ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" becomes ""blue red green green red blue,"" where ""dax bluf"" turns into ""green green.""

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color word that appears immediately before ""bluf.""
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to take the color of the word that immediately precedes it. If we analyze the patterns:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which suggests that ""walm"" takes the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.
  
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""lug wif,"" and since the output is a repetition of red after ""lug wif,"" we can assume ""walm"" takes the color of ""wif,"" which is red.

- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to the color blue, so the output after ""lug walm"" is ""blue blue blue.""

- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and hence the output includes three reds (""red red red"") after it, showing that ""walm"" takes the color of ""wif.""

- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows a ""zup,"" and the output is a sequence of yellow colors, signifying that ""walm"" takes the color of ""zup"" once again.

Considering this consistent pattern across the examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the word that precedes it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words.
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.
Rule: zup -> yellow

From the given inputs and their corresponding outputs, it's clear that every time the word ""zup"" is present in the input, the word ""yellow"" is present in the same sequential position in the output. No matter what other words are around it, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"".
Rule: ""bluf"" means ""yellow"" when it follows the word ""zup,"" but it means ""green"" when following ""dax."" In all other cases, ""bluf"" means ""blue.""
Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word the same number of times as there are letters in the previous word. 

For example:
- ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green"" because ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" and has three letters.
- ""lug zup dax walm"" outputs ""blue yellow green green green"" where ""walm"" causes ""green"" to repeat three times due to ""dax"" having three letters.
- ""zup wif walm"" outputs ""yellow red red red"" because ""wif"" is connected to ""red"" and has three letters, making ""red"" repeat three times.
- ""zup lug walm"" outputs ""yellow blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and has three letters, making ""blue"" repeat three times.
- ""wif walm dax"" outputs ""red red red green"" because of ""walm"" which makes the color before it, ""red"" associated with ""wif,"" repeat for the number of letters in ""wif,"" which is three. After ""walm,"" ""dax"" simply adds a ""green"" at the end.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the outputs. Every instance of ""lug"" in the input results in ""blue"" being part of the corresponding sequence of colors in the output.
Rule: dax -> green

Whenever the word ""dax"" is used in the input, it translates to ""green"" in the output. This rule holds true regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence.
Rule: wif -> red

Based on the examples provided, whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. The pattern holds true regardless of ""wif"" placement or the presence of other words between multiple occurrences of ""wif.""
To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" we can look at the patterns:

- ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup,"" except when following ""lug,"" in which case ""bluf"" on its own translates to ""red.""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" when it comes after ""zup,"" but translates to ""blue"" on its own as well.
- ""dax"" translates to green regardless of its position relative to ""zup.""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red"" on its own and maintains that translation when positioned before ""zup.""
- Each instance of ""zup"" correlates with the word ""yellow"" appearing in the output.

Based on these observations, it appears that:

- ""zup"" does not alter the coloring of words that follow; it retains their 'original' color.
- ""zup"" when followed immediately by ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" suggesting a doubling effect of the word that follows it.
- However, this doubling is not observed with ""lug"" (""zup lug bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue blue red"" and not ""yellow blue blue blue red"").

Given these points and especially that each ""zup"" relates to the appearance of ""yellow"" in the output, the simplest rule that ""zup"" implies is that it translates to ""yellow."" The cases where ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" can possibly be explained by the idea that ""bluf"" has a unique interaction with ""zup,"" leading to ""bluf"" being translated into ""yellow"" after ""zup,"" but this interaction is not universally applied to other words like ""lug,"" ""dax,"" or ""wif.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" translates directly to the color that follows its paired word in the input. The corresponding colors in the output follow a consistent pattern that is dependent on a specific word from the input. Here are the observations supporting this rule:

- In the first two examples, ""zup bluf"" and ""wif bluf"" both translate to two identical colors repeated: ""yellow yellow"" and ""red red"" respectively. This suggests that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word preceding it.
- In the third example, ""zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue,"" indicating that ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""bluf"" still represents ""yellow,"" which comes from ""zup.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup bluf dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow green blue."" This means ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""bluf"" again takes the color of ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
- The fifth example, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" Every word translates to its corresponding color, and ""bluf"" follows the rule by taking the color of ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word immediately preceding it.
Based on the provided examples, it’s possible to infer that the nonce word ""walm"" has a rule-based meaning that affects the output colors. In each instance, ""walm"" seems to repeat the last given color.

1. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> blue blue red blue red red red blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (which outputs red), and the output after ""walm"" is ""red red red"".
   
2. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (which outputs red), and the output after ""walm"" is ""red red red"".
   
3. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (which outputs red), and the output after ""walm"" is ""red red red"".
   
4. zup dax lug walm zup lug -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (which outputs blue), and the output after ""walm"" is ""blue blue"".
   
5. zup walm lug zup wif dax -> yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (which outputs yellow), and the output after ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow"".

From these examples, we can deduce:

Rule: The word ""walm"" repeats the output color of the word that comes immediately before it an unspecified number of times.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat last color mentioned.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug dax wif walm
    ",Output: red blue green red red red,red blue green red red red,True,191
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning of the word ""lug,"" let's review the examples provided:

Input 1: lug
Output 1: blue

Input 2: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output 2: red red green green red red red blue red

Input 3: lug
Output 3: blue

Input 4: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
Output 4: blue red red green blue blue

Input 5: lug dax walm
Output 5: blue green green green

Based on the outputs corresponding to each input where ""lug"" appears, we see that every single instance of ""lug"" is consistently translated to ""blue."" There do not appear to be any additional context-dependent rules affecting the translation of ""lug"" regardless of the other words present.

Rule: 
lug -> blue
Based on the examples given, we can infer the following:

- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red.""
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""walm"" seems to have variable output, but it corresponds to ""green"" when following ""dax.""

Moreover, every time ""dax"" precedes another word, ""green"" is added to the output, one extra time if the following word is ""walm,"" and only once for the other words.

Thus, we can deduce:

dax -> meaning. Rule:
- When ""dax"" precedes ""lug,"" ""wif,"" or ""zup,"" it adds ""green"" to the output once.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" it adds ""green"" to the output twice.

It is important to note that more examples would be necessary to fully confirm this rule, but based on the given information, this seems to be a consistent pattern.
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" seems consistently linked to the color ""red"". In every instance where ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" is present in the corresponding output.

Thus, the rule appears to be:

wif -> red

Rule: When the input contains ""wif,"" the output contains the color ""red"" for each occurrence.
Based on the examples provided, we can observe how the output changes when ""zup"" is introduced. Here's the breakdown:

1. lug walm -> blue blue
2. dax bluf -> green green
3. zup lug -> yellow blue
4. lug wif lug walm -> blue red blue blue
5. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow

When comparing the outputs, we see that typically, a word maps to a single color, but when ""zup"" is introduced, the color yellow is outputted, and the pattern of colors that follows is sometimes altered. More specifically, ""zup"" appears to output yellow and also influence the subsequent color pattern.

- In the first example, ""lug walm zup lug walm"" gives us ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue"". The sequence 'blue blue' is repeated, then interrupted by ""zup"" and resumes after a single ""yellow."" 
- In the second example, ""dax bluf zup"" gives us ""green green yellow"". The sequence 'green green' is disrupted by a ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup.""
- In the third example, ""zup lug"" outputs ""yellow blue,"" directly mapping ""zup"" to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif"" outputs ""blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red,"" where ""zup"" precedes a sequence of ""yellow"" outputs but does not seem to disrupt the sequence of colors; instead, it adds ""yellow"" and the prior sequences continue normally before and after, except for an additional ""yellow"".
- In the fifth example, ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow,"" demonstrating that ""zup"" precedes a series of ""yellow,"" perhaps suggesting that ""zup"" might multiply the following color output.

Given this information, the rule seems to be that ""zup"" outputs a ""yellow"" and either repeats this color or continues to exert influence on the subsequent words by potentially extending their associated color or causing a sequence of ""yellow."" However, there's a degree of uncertainty in predicting the exact influence on the following pattern without a more consistent set of examples.

Rule: zup -> first outputs ""yellow,"" then may influence the subsequent pattern, typically extending the subsequent color or adding ""yellow"" to the sequence.
Rule: ""bluf"" translates to ""red."" 

Let's examine the examples provided:

1. ""wif bluf dax walm"" results in ""red red green green green"". The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" as seen in the last example, ""wif bluf"" gives ""red red"". This is consistent with ""dax walm"" giving ""green green green"".

2. ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green"". The word ""dax"" means ""green"", as indicated by previous examples.

3. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" results in ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red"". We know ""lug"" means ""blue"" and ""zup"" means ""yellow"". Since ""walm dax wif"" correlates with ""yellow green red"", we can deduce by the process of elimination and consistency in the pattern that ""bluf"" correlates with ""red"".

4. ""zup bluf lug zup"" results in ""yellow yellow blue yellow"". Given that ""lug"" means ""blue"" and ""zup"" means ""yellow"", and no green is in the output, ""bluf"" cannot mean ""green"".

5. ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"", reinforcing the pattern that ""wif"" and ""bluf"" both mean ""red"".

Therefore, bluf -> red.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it. Let's verify this rule with the provided examples:

Example 1: lug dax walm wif
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- walm -> repeats the color of dax, which is green
- wif -> red
Output: blue green green green red

Example 2: zup walm
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> repeats the color of zup, which is yellow
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Example 3: dax lug walm
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- walm -> repeats the color of lug, which is blue
Output: green blue blue blue

Example 4: dax walm zup lug walm
- dax -> green
- walm -> repeats the color of dax, which is green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- walm -> repeats the color of lug, which is blue
Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

Example 5: lug walm wif lug
- lug -> blue
- walm -> repeats the color of lug, which is blue
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
Output: blue blue blue red blue

Each occurrence of ""walm"" changes its output color to match the color mentioned before it. Thus, the rule for ""walm"" can be summarized as:

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf lug zup walm lug
    ",Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow blue,yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow blue,False,192
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Each time the word ""lug"" is used in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output. Additionally, the other words correspond to different colors: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Here are the rules for each word based on the given examples:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- walm -> multiple reds based on the number of times the word ""walm"" appears

Given these observations, the rule for ""lug"" is:

lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or the rule behind the nonce word ""dax."" To do so, we'll look at where ""dax"" appears in the input and its corresponding output.

1. ""lug wif dax"" -> ""blue red green""
2. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
3. ""zup dax"" -> ""yellow green""
4. ""dax wif walm lug zup"" -> ""green red red red blue yellow""
5. ""lug dax"" -> ""blue green""

Let's analyze the inputs and outputs:

- In example 1, ""dax"" is preceded by ""lug"" and ""wif,"" with corresponding colors ""blue"" and ""red;"" the output for ""dax"" is ""green.""
- In example 2, ""dax"" comes at the beginning and is followed by ""lug"" and ""walm,"" which corresponds to the output ""green"" followed by ""blue"" and ""blue blue.""
- In example 3, ""dax"" is preceded by ""zup,"" and the corresponding output colors are ""yellow green.""
- In example 4, ""dax"" appears at the beginning again and is followed by multiple words with corresponding sequences of colors.
- In example 5, ""dax"" comes after ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue green.""

We can observe that whenever ""dax"" appears, the color ""green"" is in the output. Furthermore, ""dax"" is not associated with a specific position in the list except that it is never last. Hence, the most consistent rule that can be deduced from the given examples is that ""dax"" translates directly to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
By analyzing the input and output examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the outputs. Here's the breakdown for clarification:

- Every instance of the word ""wif"" in the input is replaced by the word ""red"" in the output.
- The word ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" in the output.
- The word ""walm"" translates to ""red"" in the output. However, the presence of ""wif"" before ""walm"" could indicate emphasis, as it turns ""walm"" into a repeated ""red red"".
- The word ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" in the output.
- The word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" in the output.
- The word ""dax"" translates to ""green"" in the output.

Considering this consistent translation in various contexts where ""wif"" is present, the word ""wif"" can be deduced to mean ""red"". Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
From the given examples, we can induce the following associations:

- Every occurrence of the word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
- The word ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
- The word ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
- The word ""dax walm"" together translates to ""green green green.""

We can notice that the output is a sequence of color names corresponding to the input sequence, with each nonce word and phrase being consistently associated with the same color or sequence of colors. 

Based on these observations, the rule is:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
Rule: bluf corresponds to repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. 

For ""wif bluf,"" wif is associated with red, so bluf means red. For ""zup bluf,"" zup is associated with yellow, so bluf means yellow. The output is always a repetition of the color that comes before bluf. Therefore:

bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before bluf.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following patterns:

- ""wif lug walm"" translates to ""red blue blue blue"". Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". The word ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it multiple times.

- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"". ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""walm"" repeats it multiple times.

- ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"". ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""walm"" repeats it multiple times.

- ""dax lug walm zup wif"" translates to ""green blue blue blue yellow red"". Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""wif"" to ""red"". ""Walm"" repeats the color of ""lug"", which is ""blue"", multiple times before moving to the next color.

- ""dax walm wif"" translates to ""green green green red"". ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red"". ""Walm"" repeats the color of ""dax"", which is ""green"", multiple times.

From these patterns, we can establish that the word ""walm"" causes the previously mentioned color to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" three times.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples where the word ""wif"" appears and its corresponding output, ""wif"" seems to be consistently translated to the color ""red"". Therefore, we can deduce that ""wif"" means ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" in the input corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" translates to a repeated output of the color that directly follows it in the sequence. Here's the breakdown:

Example 1: ""dax wif walm lug zup walm""
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- walm -> red red (following ""wif"")
- lug -> red (from previous rule ""walm-> red red"")

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, each instance of the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule is as follows:

lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following rules about the word 'dax' and its relation to output colors:

1. When 'dax' is present in the input, 'green' always appears in the corresponding output. This happens regardless of the position of 'dax' in the input sequence.
2. The word 'wif' produces 'red' when in the presence of 'dax'.
3. The word 'lug' produces 'blue' when in the presence of 'dax'.
4. Repetitions of the word 'dax' result in repetitions of 'green' in the output.
5. The word 'walm' seems to produce 'green' when 'dax' precedes it, suggesting that perhaps 'dax' has some transformative effect on the output color associated with words following it.
6. The word 'bluf' results in two 'red's following in the next outputs, but only if 'dax' and another 'green' producing word precede it. Without 'dax', we cannot be sure of the direct meaning of 'bluf'.

Combining these observations, we can create a rule for the meaning of 'dax':

Rule: The presence of 'dax' in an input generates 'green' in the output and may also alter the output color associated with the following word(s). 

So the general rule seems to be:
dax -> green (and potential transformation of subsequent outputs)
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. By comparing the inputs with their respective outputs, we can deduce the meaning of each word including the nonce word 'wif'.

- The word 'wif' is present in every example and consistently translates to the color 'red'.
- The word 'zup' is present in three inputs and each time it translates to the color 'yellow'.
- The word 'dax' appears in two different inputs and in both cases, the output ends with 'green'.
- The word 'bluf' appears in three different inputs and corresponds to the color 'red' each time it is not preceded by 'wif'.
- The word 'lug' appears in two inputs and translates to 'blue'.

Taking into account this information, here is the rule for the nonce word 'wif':

Rule: wif -> red
By analyzing the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""zup.""

In the first input-output pair, every time ""zup"" appears, it is followed by ""dax"" and the color sequence ""yellow green"" repeats accordingly. However, this pattern does not hold in the other examples.

In the second pair, ""zup"" is adjacent to ""dax"" and the color ""yellow green"" follows, but it is preceded by ""lug"" which corresponds to the color ""blue."" This suggests ""zup"" does not depend on the preceding word to be translated as ""yellow.""

The third example is consistent with ""zup"" being followed by ""yellow"" again, even though the words that follow it (""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""dax"") correspond to different colors (""red,"" ""blue,"" ""green"").

The fourth example solidifies the translation of ""zup"" as ""yellow,"" as it appears multiple times and is always followed by the color ""yellow,"" regardless of the context.

The fifth example further supports the independent translation of ""zup"" as ""yellow,"" even when it is at the end of the sequence.

From these examples, it seems clear that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position or context within the given sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""bluf"" directly translates to the color ""blue"".

Rule: bluf -> blue.
Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

- ""lug"" is associated with blue, so ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue.""
- ""dax"" is associated with green, so ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green.""
- ""wif"" is associated with red, so ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" correlates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output. The word 'dax' corresponds to 'green', and 'wif' consistently corresponds to 'red' regardless of its position in the input sequence. Here's the mapping from the given examples:

- 'dax' -> green
- 'lug' -> blue
- 'walm' -> red 
- 'wif' -> red
- 'bluf' -> red
- 'zup' -> yellow

Therefore, the rule for 'wif' is that it always translates to the color 'red' in the output, independent of context.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, each word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in each example provided. Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" is as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the instances where it appears and analyze the corresponding outputs:

1. ""dax bluf zup"" corresponds to ""green green yellow""
2. ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" corresponds to ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue""
3. ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow""
4. ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax"" corresponds to ""red red yellow red blue green""
5. ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" corresponds to ""blue green green yellow blue red""

By examining the positions of ""bluf"" and the color it is paired with in the output, the following can be observed:
- When ""bluf"" is in the second position, it's ""green"" (examples 1, 4, and 5).
- When ""bluf"" is in the fourth position, it's ""yellow"" (example 2).
- When ""bluf"" is the second word in a two-word input, it's ""yellow"" (example 3).

Based on these examples, the color associated with ""bluf"" does not seem to follow a strict positional or contextual rule that can be inferred from the given data. However, one possible rule is that ""bluf"" is ""green"" when it immediately follows ""dax,"" and ""yellow"" otherwise. 

Rule: bluf is ""green"" when it immediately follows the word ""dax,"" and ""yellow"" in all other positions.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the inputs and outputs provided:

- When the input is ""zup wif walm,"" the output is ""yellow red red red."" Here ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" seems to lead to three reds.
  
- When the input is ""dax walm zup walm,"" the output is ""green green green yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and each ""walm"" seems to triple the color that comes just before.

- When the input is ""dax walm wif walm zup,"" the output is ""green green green red red red yellow."" Again, ""dax"" leads to green, and ""wif"" leads to red. Each ""walm"" triples the color preceding it, while ""zup"" at the end gives a single yellow.

- When the input is ""dax lug walm,"" the output is ""green blue blue blue."" Here ""dax"" is green, ""lug"" is blue, and ""walm"" triples the blue.

- When the input is ""zup bluf lug zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here ""zup"" is yellow, ""bluf"" doesn't seem to have a corresponding color in the output, and ""lug"" is blue. The final ""walm"" triples the yellow that comes right before it. It seems that ""bluf"" may be irrelevant to the color output or ignored in this context.

Looking at these patterns, it looks like ""walm"" might be an instruction to triple the color that precedes it.

Rule: walm -> repeat the previous color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
Based on the given examples, here are the rules I have induced for the meaning of ""dax"" and the other nonce words:

dax -> green

The rule for other words based on the given input and output pairs is:

lug -> blue
walm -> repeated twice more starting with the color blue (blue blue blue)
bluf -> green
wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Therefore, the rule is:
- Each nonce word corresponds to a specific color.
- The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"".
- The word ""walm"" triggers a repetition of ""blue"" three times.

Rule: Each nonce word is assigned a specific color. ""Dax"" always means ""green"".
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
Based on the given examples, it appears that each occurrence of ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule is as follows: zup -> yellow.
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to correspond to a color in the output. Let's look at each example to analyze the pattern:

1. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

2. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red

3. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

4. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

What we can observe from the examples is that ""walm"" seems to adopt the color that appears before it, except when it's at the start of the sequence or after ""wif"", in which case it adopts the color ""blue."" Here's how the rule seems to apply in each case: 

1. ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and in the output, the color ""blue"" is after ""lug,"" so ""walm"" becomes ""blue.""

2. ""walm"" is the second word; it follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow"" where it appears, so ""walm"" becomes ""yellow."" 

3. The first ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and becomes ""blue"" in the output. The second ""walm"" in the sequence follows ""lug"" and thus becomes ""blue"" as well.

4. ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and thus becomes ""yellow"" in the output.

5. ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and so it becomes ""blue"" in the output.

Furthermore, when ""walm"" directly follows ""wif"", it translates to ""blue"" consistently. Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" takes the color of the preceding word, with a default or fallback to ""blue"" when it follows ""wif"" or when no other color can be determined.

Rule: walm becomes the color of the word immediately before it in the sequence, with a default to ""blue"" if it follows ""wif"" or is at the start of the sequence.

So, based on the rule induction from the given examples:

walm -> meaning. Rule: walm becomes the color of the preceding word, with a default to ""blue"" if it follows ""wif"" or is at the start of the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
dax -> green

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""green"".
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in all given examples.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow."" This can be confirmed by noticing that whenever ""zup"" is present in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output at the same position.

Here is the rule formulated based on the examples given:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" is substituted with the color ""yellow"" in the output.
bluf -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word. Rule: When the word bluf follows another word, it takes on the meaning of repeating the color associated with that preceding word.

- lug bluf -> blue blue (bluf repeats the color associated with lug, which is blue)
- wif bluf -> red red (bluf repeats the color associated with wif, which is red)
- dax lug wif bluf -> green blue red red (here bluf repeats the color associated with wif, as lug doesn't immediately precede bluf)
- zup lug bluf -> yellow blue blue (bluf repeats the color associated with lug since it directly follows it, which is blue)
- lug bluf wif -> blue blue red (bluf follows lug and repeats its color, which is blue, and then wif adds its own color, red)
To work out the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at each instance and its corresponding output. We're looking for a consistent pattern that could help us understand the rule underlying the use of ""walm.""

1. wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   red red green green red red red blue red

2. zup wif walm
   yellow red red red

3. zup wif walm
   yellow red red red

4. lug dax zup dax walm wif
   blue green yellow green green green red

5. dax walm
   green green green

From the examples, every time ""walm"" appears, it produces an output of three of the same color. The color repeated three times corresponds to the color that follows ""walm.""

- In the first example, after ""walm,"" the word ""lug"" appears, which corresponds to the color blue, and the output is ""red blue red."" We notice two things: the first color is red (which could be the default or stand-in color), then follows the blue (corresponding to ""lug""), and then red again.

- In the second and third examples, there are no words after ""walm,"" yet it maps to ""red red red,"" which suggests that the color red might be a default when ""walm"" is at the end.

- In the fourth example, ""walm"" precedes ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, and the output is ""green green red,"" which again matches the previous pattern with a three-color repetition ending in ""red.""

- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is at the end and is followed by three greens, indicating that the end position rule of defaulting to red doesn't always apply.

Based on these observations, we can deduce a rule associated with ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in a sequence, it seems to signal a repetition of the next color mentioned after it twice, followed by that color or an instance of the preceding color. If ""walm"" is at the end or if it is not followed by another color, the default color is red, which is repeated three times.

So: walm -> meaning. Meaning: ""Walm"" indicates that the next color word mentioned should be repeated twice, followed by that color or by the preceding color in the sequence. If ""walm"" is at the end or lacks a following color word, the resulting color is red, which is repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" correlates to the color ""green"" in every output.

To assess this further, verify whether each following word correlates to the other colors in the same manner:

- ""lug"" consistently results in ""blue.""
- ""wif"" consistently yields ""red.""
- ""walm"" is always translated to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" maps to ""yellow.""

Given that ""wif"" and ""walm"" produce different colors in the examples (red and blue respectively), but then ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"", it suggests a possible pattern alteration when multiple words follow ""dax"". However, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" which indicates that ""walm"" might have a rule attached to it, such as repeating the color of the word it follows.

Thus, the rule could be:
- ""dax"" means ""green.""
- Each nonce word following ""dax"" has a corresponding color, except ""walm,"" which repeats the color of the word before it.

The inferred rules are as follows:
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- walm -> repeat the color of the previous word
- zup -> yellow
From the provided examples, we can induce the following correlations between the inputs and outputs:

1. ""wif dax"" -> ""red green"". ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and immediately before it, ""wif"" must correlate to ""red.""
2. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red"". ""Walm"" corresponds to three reds, and ""wif"" once again is directly followed by a red, suggesting ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
3. ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red"". This further supports the idea that ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" to red, and ""walm"" to a triple red.
4. ""dax wif"" -> ""green red"". Here, ""dax"" still corresponds to green, and ""wif"" follows as red.
5. ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue"". ""Lug"" still corresponds to blue, and ""wif"" precedes it as red.

Rule:
wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output, and the order of the words in the input reflects the order of colors in the output.

By examining the examples we can see:

1. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" 
2. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" 
3. ""walm"" corresponds to ""red,""
4. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" 
5. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Therefore, regardless of its position in the input sequence, ""zup"" consistently results in ""yellow"" in the output sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> blue
Based on the provided examples, we need to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm.""

Let's analyze the examples and their corresponding outputs:

1. `dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax` -> green blue blue blue green red red green
2. `dax zup walm wif walm` -> green yellow yellow yellow red red red
3. `zup walm dax` -> yellow yellow yellow green
4. `zup wif dax walm lug` -> yellow red green green green blue
5. `wif dax zup walm` -> red green yellow yellow yellow

Looking at these sequences, we can make some observations:

- The word ""walm"" always precedes a sequence of ""yellow"" in the output.
- ""walm"" does not seem to have a fixed color output itself; the output color varies based on the word that comes after ""walm.""
- When ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"", the output is ""red red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" might change the subsequent word's color output to ""red"" and does not affect the color output of itself.
- When ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"", the output is ""yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" might be changing ""dax"" to output ""yellow"" instead of its regular color, ""green.""
- When ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"", as seen in example 4, ""lug"", which usually outputs ""blue"", is preceded by three ""green"" which suggests that ""walm"" might be creating a repetition effect (three ""green"" before ""blue"").
- ""walm"" on its own or at the end of a sequence has a yellow output (see examples 3 and 5).

Based on these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" serves as a modifier that affects the color output of the word that follows it. When ""walm"" is followed by another word, it changes the color output to ""yellow"" and may cause repetition of the color ""yellow"" depending on the following word. However, when ""walm"" is at the end of a sequence or does not have a specific word following it, the output is ""yellow.""

Rule: walm -> changes the color output of the following word to ""yellow,"" may cause the color ""yellow"" to repeat before other colors based on the following word, and outputs ""yellow"" when there is no specific word following it or it's at the end of a sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
