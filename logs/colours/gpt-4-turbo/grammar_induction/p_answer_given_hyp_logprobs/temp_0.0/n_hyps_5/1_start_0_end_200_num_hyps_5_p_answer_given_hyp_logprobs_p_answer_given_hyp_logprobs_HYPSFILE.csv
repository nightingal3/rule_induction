Rule: wif -> red, causing the next color to be repeated once.",-4.64018582318,0,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif"", we need to analyze the correspondence between the inputs and their outputs. 

Input: zup bluf wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow red red
- It seems that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" to ""red"". Since ""wif"" comes before the second ""bluf"" which is ""red"", it could signify a color or a repetition of the color that comes after it.

Input: wif walm zup walm
Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
- ""walm"" is followed by ""yellow"" but it is preceded by ""red"" when ""wif"" comes before it. ""zup"" is consistently ""yellow"". With ""wif"" at the beginning followed by ""walm"", it consistently translates to ""red"" preceding the color that ""walm"" denotes, which is ""yellow"".

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red
- ""lug"" appears to correspond to ""blue"". ""Wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" which we know is ""red""; thus, ""wif"" again is associated with the color following it, ""red"".

Based on these examples, it looks like ""wif"" translates to or signifies the next color word's color, possibly also indicating duplication of that color. To test this:

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red
- This input/output combination is consistent with the previous analysis, supporting the rule.

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue
- With ""wif"" at the beginning, followed by ""lug"" which we know is ""blue"", it again leads to ""red"" before the colors sequence that follows suggest.

The rule seems to be that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" and it may also indicate repetition of the next mentioned color. However, since ""wif"" is followed by ""yellow"" or ""blue"" in some cases without ""red"" being repeated after ""yellow"" or ""blue"", we can refine the rule:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"", with a possible function of preceding repetition based on context. If another color follows ""wif"", then ""red"" will be output before the following color. If ""wif"" comes after a color word, it seems to ensure that color word is repeated.

Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" in this context is:
wif -> red (and may indicate repetition of the following color or ensure the preceding color word is repeated)",-5.46141406401,0,wif
"From the given examples, it seems that ""wif"" alters the output based on the word following it. Here is the analysis:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red.""
2. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output sequence includes ""red red red"" before ""yellow yellow yellow.""
3. When ""lug"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red blue blue.""

Based on the provided data, we can infer that ""wif"" is a modifier that duplicates the color associated with the word that follows it:

- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Thus, ""wif"" precedes a color word and results in that color word's corresponding color being mentioned twice in the output. Here is the rule expressed in your requested format:

Rule: wif -> The word following ""wif"" will have its corresponding color output doubled. For example:
- ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red.""
- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"" (before the color for ""walm,"" which is ""yellow"" follows).
- ""wif lug"" leads to ""red blue blue.""",-5.493875581806,0,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the provided examples and their corresponding outputs. We will compare each input with the ""wif"" word to the expected outputs.

1. Input: zup bluf wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""
   - When ""wif"" follows ""bluf,"" the output is ""red"" again.
   
2. Input: wif walm zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
   - ""walm"" after ""zup"" corresponds to a triple ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" at the beginning followed by ""walm"" leads to ""red"" twice, and ""walm"" following ""zup"" gives ""yellow"" three times.
   
3. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" followed by ""bluf"" results in ""red"" twice.
   
4. The fourth input is the same as the third, and thus has the same output pattern.

5. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when following ""zup"", but since it's not following ""zup"" here, we don't know its standalone meaning. However, here ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which seems to transform into ""blue.""
   - ""wif"" followed by ""lug"" results in ""red"" once followed by ""blue"" twice, likely due to ""lug.""

We can propose a general rule for ""wif"" based on the above examples:

Rule: ""wif"" seems to indicate repetition or a change in the output color pattern, basing on the color the word following it corresponds to. Specifically, if ""wif"" is followed by a word, the output color of that word is repeated once more.

Based on this rule induction:

- In examples 1 and 3, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" (which corresponds to red), so the output is ""red"" repeated once.
- In example 2, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" and since ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when following ""zup,"" but in this case, it is not following ""zup."" The output is ""red"" twice, likely indicating ""walm"" alone would correspond to red, and ""wif"" is causing it to be repeated once.
- In example 5, ""wif"" is followed by ""lug"" (blue), and the output is ""red"" once, but the word after ""wif,"" ""lug,"" is instead repeated twice.

However, there may not be enough information to conclude with absolute certainty, as the standalone color for ""walm"" is unknown in scenarios without ""zup.""

2. Input: wif walm zup walm

- ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.
- ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow.

- In example 3, ""lug walm"" leads to the output ""blue blue blue"", following the same pattern of extending the color associated with ""lug"" (which is blue), and ""walm"" repeats it three times.
- In example 4, ""zup walm wif"" has the output ""yellow yellow yellow red"". Here ""wif"" definitely corresponds to ""red"", and following the pattern, ""zup"" would correspond to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" once again repeats the color three times.
- In example 5, ""lug dax walm"" results in ""blue green green green"". The word ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""dax"" to green, and following the pattern ""walm"" repeats the color green associated with ""dax"" three times.

- In ""wif walm zup walm,"" the presence of ""zup walm"" generates ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting that the initial ""wif walm"" is independent and corresponds to ""red red red.""
- ""zup bluf"" generates ""yellow yellow,"" suggesting ""bluf"" is also two syllables.
- ""lug zup"" shows that the order matters—since ""zup"" comes after ""lug,"" only one instance of ""yellow"" is produced, corresponding to the single syllable in ""zup.""

Rule: zup -> For every syllable in the word following ""zup,"" output ""yellow"" that many times. If zup is the last word, output yellow once.",-3.70707296194,1,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" adds the color-word ""yellow"" to the output. Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" seems to be that it translates to ""yellow"" in the output. 

The number of times ""yellow"" is repeated in the output correlates with the number of syllables in the word that follows ""zup."" For example:

- ""zup walm"" has one syllable in ""walm,"" resulting in one ""yellow"" in the output.
- ""zup lug"" has one syllable in ""lug,"" resulting in one ""yellow"" in the output.
- ""wif walm zup walm"" has the additional ""wif walm"" in the input, which is translated to ""red red red"" and does not affect the ""zup"" translation. ""walm,"" occurring again after ""zup,"" results again in one ""yellow"" per syllable.
- ""zup bluf,"" where ""bluf"" seems to have one syllable, results in one ""yellow"" in the output.
- ""lug zup"" changes the order, but ""zup"" still translates to ""yellow.""

So, we can formulate the following rule:
Rule: zup -> ""yellow"" repeated once for each syllable in the word that immediately follows ""zup."" If ""zup"" is the last word or no word follows, it results in one ""yellow"" by default.",-4.840067463480001,1,zup

- ""walm"" has one syllable, so ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow"" repeated once.
- ""lug"" has one syllable, so ""zup lug"" results in ""yellow"" repeated once.
- ""bluf"" has one syllable, so ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow"" repeated once.

So, ""zup"" -> ""yellow"" (number of repetitions based on the syllables of the following word).",-6.09990443632,1,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each instance of ""zup"" in the input results in ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",-7.4726225238,1,zup
"Observing the given examples:

- `lug walm wif lug bluf` -> `blue blue blue red blue blue`
- `zup wif bluf` -> `yellow red red`
- `wif bluf` -> `red red`
- `dax lug wif bluf` -> `green blue red red`
- `lug bluf wif` -> `blue blue red`

One can notice that ""bluf"" corresponds to a color output in each case. ""Wif"" seems to always correspond to ""red"", and based on the repeated patterns, it is reasonable to hypothesize that ""bluf"" produces ""red"" but under certain conditions it might be influenced by preceding words.

However, since ""bluf"" alone does not appear in any of the examples, it's not possible to determine its individual output. It's also worth noting that ""bluf"" does not strictly follow ""wif"" to produce ""red"" in the output. This is evident in that the first example does not have two ""red"" outputs in a row, even though ""bluf"" follows ""wif"".

By the given examples, we can create a hypothesis:

Rule: When ""bluf"" is immediately preceded by ""wif"", the output is ""red"". In all other cases, the meaning of ""bluf"" is not clearly deducible from the given examples.

2. Input: dax wif **walm**

4. Input: dax wif **walm**
   Output: green red **red** red

5. Input: lug **walm** zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue **blue** yellow blue yellow red

Looking at the instances where ""walm"" is used in the sequence, it appears that the color after ""walm"" (which is the response to ""walm"") is a repeat of the color assigned to the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

- In example 1, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output color is red for both.
- In example 2 and 4, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output color is red immediately after ""walm.""
- In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output color is blue immediately after ""walm.""
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output color is blue immediately after ""walm.""

So, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the output color of the word that comes right before it. Thus:

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Observations:
1. ""walm"" is always followed by a sequence of red or blue.
2. When ""wif"" appears before ""walm,"" ""red red red"" follows.
3. When ""lug"" appears before ""walm,"" ""blue blue blue"" follows.
4. ""walm"" on its own is immediately preceded by either ""wif"" or ""lug,"" and the pattern that follows is contingent on the preceding word (""wif"" or ""lug"").
5. ""walm"" does not correlate to a single color but instead to a sequence of colors.

Based on the observations, it seems that ""walm"" represents a repeat of the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm."" Specifically, the number of repetitions is three, as the color associated with the preceding word is repeated three times after ""walm.""

Rule:

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the inputs and outputs, looking for patterns associated with the occurrence of ""walm."" These patterns can help infer a rule that defines ""walm.""

1. The word ""walm"" always results in the output of three consecutive ""red"" colors.
2. This pattern is not altered by the position of ""walm"" in the input sentence (beginning, middle, or end).
3. The consistency of ""walm"" producing three ""red"" colors seems independent of the surrounding words, as their outputs vary (""wif"" leading to green/red, ""dax"" to green, ""lug"" to blue, ""zup"" to yellow).
4. The surrounding words are associated with their respective colors regardless of their position, which reinforces that ""walm"" specifically outputs red three times.

Rule: Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule for ""walm"":

- Finally, when ""wif"" is the last word following ""zup"" and ""lug,"" the output is ""yellow blue red,"" suggesting ""wif"" retains its association with ""red.""

   ""wif"" corresponds to a single red, ""walm"" corresponds to either two or three reds, and ""lug"" corresponds to yellow. It is not entirely clear why ""walm"" corresponds to different numbers of reds, but importantly, after ""zup"" is said, ""lug"" corresponds to blue instead of yellow. When ""zup"" appears again, the ""walm"" that follows does not have the same color pattern as before.

2. zup bluf lug dax lug -> yellow yellow blue green blue
   ""bluf"" corresponds to blue, ""dax"" to green, and ""lug"" to blue when it appears after ""dax"". However, ""lug"" appears as blue, not yellow after ""zup,"" indicating a pattern change.

3. dax wif zup -> green red yellow
   ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""wif"" to red, and ""zup"" to yellow (without any word following it to potentially change).

4. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
   ""wif"" corresponds to red, and once again, ""zup"" is followed by ""wif"" and outputs yellow.

5. wif zup -> red yellow
   ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""zup"" to yellow.

Looking at the instances where ""zup"" appears, it seems to affect the color output directly following it, except when it's the last word or only followed by ""wif"". It also appears that ""zup"" itself corresponds to yellow unless it follows another word, in which case, it affects the pattern for the words that follow it.

Summary Rule: The word ""zup"" on its own translates to yellow. When preceding another word (except for ""wif""), ""zup"" changes the expected color output of that word. 

Rule:
zup -> yellow (when it is at the end of a phrase or followed by ""wif"")
zup -> changes the following word's color output (when followed by a word other than ""wif"")",-1.1036403333340001,2,zup
"To figure out the meaning of ""zup,"" we will analyze the patterns in the provided in-and-out examples. We will consider each unique word and its corresponding color output.

Based on the given examples:

- Each instance of ""wif"" translates to a single ""red.""
- Each instance of ""walm"" after ""wif"" leads to three ""red"" outputs. In the absence of ""wif,"" ""walm"" results in two ""yellow"" outputs.
- The word ""bluf"" corresponded to a ""yellow"" followed by a ""blue.""
- The word ""dax"" results in a ""green"" every time it appears.
- The word ""lug"" results in a ""blue"" every time it appears.

Now, let's break down each example in conjunction with the rule for ""zup"":

1. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   Analysis: ""wif walm"" is red red red. ""lug"" is blue. The remaining ""zup walm"" must correspond to the yellow yellow. So, ""zup"" is immediately followed by a ""yellow.""

2. Input: zup bluf lug dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow blue green blue
   Analysis: ""zup"" at the beginning corresponds to a ""yellow,"" which is followed by another ""yellow"" due to ""bluf."" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" Again, ""zup"" here corresponds to a ""yellow.""

3. Input: dax wif zup
   Output: green red yellow
   Analysis: ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""zup"" in this position corresponds to ""yellow.""

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Analysis: Here, ""zup"" appears before ""wif walm"" and corresponds to a ""yellow,"" maintaining consistency with previous examples.

5. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow
   Analysis: ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""zup"" is the remaining ""yellow.""

From these examples, we can deduce that ""zup"" consistently translates to a ""yellow,"" regardless of its position among the other words.

Rule: zup -> yellow",-3.3929306931410004,2,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look for patterns related to ""zup"" in the provided examples.

In the first example, we see:
Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Here ""zup"" precedes ""lug,"" which correlates to ""yellow blue"". After ""walm,"" ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow."" Let's look for the same pattern in the other examples.

In the second example:
Input: zup bluf lug dax lug
Output: yellow yellow blue green blue

""Zup"" comes before ""bluf,"" which correlates to ""yellow yellow,"" but we have to be cautious with this as ""zup"" is at the beginning, and it could translate differently at the start of a sentence. 

In the third example:
Input: dax wif zup
Output: green red yellow

Here ""zup"" is at the end, following ""wif,"" and translates to ""yellow.""

In the fourth example:
Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

""Zup"" is at the beginning again and translates to ""yellow.""

In the last example:
Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Here ""zup"" follows ""wif"" and translates to ""yellow,"" which is consistent with the previous example where ""zup"" followed ""wif.""

Based on the provided examples, ""zup"" always correlates to ""yellow."" However, it is important to notice the position of ""zup"" might influence what follows, but there are not enough examples to determine that for sure. Its own direct translation appears to be consistent.

Rule: zup -> yellow",-7.023730987659,2,zup
"Considering the given examples, one approach to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" is by looking at the position of ""zup"" in the input and the corresponding colors in the output. Here are the observations:

1. When ""zup"" follows ""wif,"" the output color for ""zup"" is yellow.
2. When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output for ""zup"" is yellow, followed by an increased sequence of reds for ""walm.""
3. When ""zup"" is at the beginning of the sequence, it is followed by yellow.
4. ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" regardless of the surrounding words.

Based on observing the inputs and outputs, we can deduce that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" consistently, regardless of the context.

Rule: zup -> yellow",-9.098369743646,2,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Given the examples provided, each occurrence of the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.",-10.062518828159998,2,zup
"Analyzing the given input-output pairs, we can attempt to determine the meaning of ""bluf"" based on the corresponding outputs:

1. *Input:* zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug

   The word ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""yellow"".

2. *Input:* lug dax bluf zup lug wif

4. *Input:* wif walm lug bluf  
   *Output:* red red red blue blue  
   The word ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"".

5. *Input:* zup bluf  
   *Output:* yellow yellow  
   The word ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

Looking at the commonalities and discrepancies, ""bluf"" seems to correspond to a color that is repeated. Specifically, ""bluf"" seems not to have its own color, but instead takes on the color of the word that precedes it:
- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which is ""green"" and then later ""zup"" which is ""yellow.""
- In the third and fifth examples, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which is ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" also represents ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, though ""bluf"" is at the end, if we apply the rule of taking the previous word's color, it takes ""lug"" which is ""red,"" yet the output is ""blue blue."" It seems for the color ""red,"" the rule changes and ""bluf"" becomes ""blue blue.""

Let's adjust the rule taking into account example 4 where ""bluf"" is different. The possible rule could be:

When ""bluf"" follows a regular word, it takes that word's color, but when it follows ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""red"" and is the only instance of this exception in the provided examples), it becomes ""blue blue.""

Here is a revised rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Takes the color of the word before it, but if that word is ""lug"" (red), then ""bluf"" becomes ""blue blue"".",-0.8941249412200001,2,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, each unique word corresponds to a distinct color, and the word 'bluf' consistently translates to the color 'yellow'. 

However, there is an inconsistency in the fourth example:

Input: wif walm lug bluf

According to the other examples, 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', but in this output, the word 'bluf' is translated to 'blue' instead of 'yellow'. Assuming that all the other translations that we can be confident of hold constant (zup -> yellow, wif -> red, lug -> blue), we might propose that there is a typographical error in the fourth input-output pair. If 'bluf' indeed translates to 'blue', it would contradict the established meaning from the other examples.

Given the information primarily from the first three examples and assuming the fourth contains an error, the rule for 'bluf' seems to be:

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in each example.

1. In the first example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" maps to ""blue blue blue red blue blue."" We can notice that the words ""lug"" and ""bluf"" correspond to the color ""blue,"" while ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" Since ""walm"" is surrounded by ""lug,"" and the output is three repetitions of ""blue,"" it suggests that ""walm"" could mean a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it.

2. In the second example, ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" translates to ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow."" Again, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the output is three ""red"" in a row. The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" This supports the idea that ""walm"" means repeating the color linked with the preceding word.

3. ""Dax walm"" translates to ""green green green."" Here, ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and it's followed by a repetition of the color ""green"" three times. This is consistent with the previous examples.

4. ""Wif walm"" leads to ""red red red."" This also matches the pattern where ""walm"" causes the preceding word's color to be repeated.

5. Lastly, ""dax zup dax walm"" yields ""green yellow green green green."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" After a second ""dax,"" we see ""green"" repeated three times due to ""walm.""

Input: dax wif dax
Output: green red green
- It appears that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and the presence of ""wif"" introduces ""red"" between the two occurrences of ""green"".

Input: wif dax
Output: red green
- ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green"", and ""wif"" appears to be ""red,"" as it precedes ""green.""

Input: wif
Output: red
- Without any other words to influence the output, ""wif"" by itself yields ""red.""

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" while ""wif"" is followed by three occurrences of ""red,"" which may suggest that ""wif"" induces a ""red"" output, but the rule is ambiguous here since ""walm"" alone does not appear in any examples. It is unknown if ""walm"" affects the output. However, because ""wif"" is associated with red in every output, it is consistent to consider ""wif"" as ""red.""

Input: wif
Output: red
- Once again, ""wif"" by itself is associated with ""red.""

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.

"Reviewing the provided examples where ""bluf"" is used, we observe that the output seems to depend on both the presence and the position of ""bluf"" among other words:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output is ""red red"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" or ""zup"", the output contains a doubled color of the word that comes before ""bluf"".
- ""bluf"" following ""wif"" results in ""red red"", irrespective of what comes after. However, following ""dax"" or ""zup"" results in a repetition of ""green"" or ""yellow"" respectively.

Given this observation, it appears that ""bluf"" represents a rule that says to repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word:
- ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.

So, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be: repeat the color output of the word that immediately precedes ""bluf"".

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color represented by the preceding word.",-6.692097648020001,3,bluf
"Based on the input-output pairs provided, we can infer a pattern where the word ""bluf"" is associated with a color repeated the number of times there are words in the input sequence before ""bluf"". Here are the observations:

1. ""wif dax bluf"" has two words before ""bluf"", and the output is ""green green"", which suggests ""bluf"" corresponds to two ""green"" colors.
2. ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" has two words before ""bluf"", and the output includes ""yellow yellow"", which corresponds to the two preceding words.
3. ""dax zup bluf"" has two words before ""bluf"", and the output is ""yellow yellow"", following the same pattern.
4. ""wif bluf dax walm"" has one word before the first occurrence of ""bluf"" and the output is ""red"", corresponding to the first word. However, the ""dax walm"" that follows does not have ""bluf"" after it, yet it outputs ""green green green"", suggesting the ""bluf"" may carry over its effect, doubling the color associated with ""dax"" (green).
5. ""wif bluf zup bluf wif"" follows a complex pattern where the first ""bluf"" has one word before it, resulting in ""red"", and the second ""bluf"" has one word before it, resulting in another ""yellow"", and the final ""wif"" maintains its own color, ""red"".

Considering these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" takes the color associated with the preceding word and repeats it an equal number of times as there are words before ""bluf"".

Thus, the rule appears to be:

bluf -> Repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word, for the number of times equal to the total count of words preceding ""bluf"" in the sequence.

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it, and the repetition count is equal to the number of words before ""bluf"" in the input.",-6.943623940379998,3,bluf
"Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the color word that follows it being repeated once more than it otherwise would. If ""bluf"" precedes a color word, that color word's corresponding output color is repeated an additional time. If ""bluf"" is at the end or not followed by a recognizable color word, it defaults to repeating the last mentioned color.

Examples:
- In ""wif dax bluf"": ""dax"" represents ""green"", and since ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", it causes ""green"" to appear twice (initially and then repeated due to ""bluf"").
- In ""wif bluf dax walm"": ""bluf"" precedes ""dax"", therefore ""green"" is repeated twice before moving on to ""walm"", which represents ""blue"", repeated thrice.

bluf -> The rule is that the color following ""bluf"" is repeated once more than its standard pattern. If ""bluf"" is at the end or not followed by a color, it repeats the last mentioned color following the same repetition pattern.",-8.52308869206,3,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" when following ""wif,"" and it translates to ""yellow"" when following ""zup."" When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it remains ambiguous as to whether it should be green or something else, since there is only one instance and ""dax"" is already mapped to green. The context does not provide enough information to deduce its color after ""dax.""

Thus, we can posit the following rule:

bluf -> meaning. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it means red. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it means yellow. The color meaning of ""bluf"" after other words is not determined with the given data.

Rule:
- After ""wif"": bluf -> red
- After ""zup"": bluf -> yellow

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",-1.00517240126,4,walm
"From the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" is affecting the color that follows the word preceding ""walm"". To determine what ""walm"" means, let's examine the patterns:

- In the first example, ""wif dax zup walm"" leads to ""red green yellow yellow yellow"". Here ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output for ""zup"" turns into three ""yellow"" instead of a single ""yellow."" Therefore, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with ""zup"" two extra times.

- In the second example, ""dax walm lug"" leads to ""green green green blue."" Since ""dax"" normally corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in two additional repetitions of ""green.""

- The third example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf,"" shows that ""walm"" following ""lug"" leads to two extra repetitions of ""blue,"" just as with other color words.

- The fourth and fifth examples, ""lug walm"" and ""dax walm,"" support the repetition rule by showing the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" being repeated two extra times without any additional colors introduced afterward.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, it causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated two additional times.

walm -> cause the color of the previous word to be repeated two additional times.",-3.02507509369,4,walm
"Based on the information provided, walm seems to be associated with repeating the color of the preceding word’s output for a certain number of times. For example:

- In the first example, ""wif dax zup walm,"" the color that comes before walm is ""yellow"" from ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""dax walm lug,"" the color that comes before walm is ""green"" from ""dax,"" and the output is ""green"" repeated three times.
- In the third example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf,"" the color that comes before walm is ""blue"" from ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue"" repeated three times, followed by the respective colors for ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""bluf.""
- In the fourth and fifth examples with just ""lug walm"" and ""dax walm,"" the color before ""walm"" is ""blue"" in the first and ""green"" in the second, both repeated three times.

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look at the patterns of input and output pairs.

Looking at the examples:

1. ""wif bluf dax lug"" maps to ""red red green blue""
2. ""zup bluf lug"" maps to ""yellow yellow blue""
3. ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" maps to ""yellow yellow red green red yellow""
4. ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" maps to ""green green red yellow blue""
5. ""dax bluf"" maps to ""green green""

The word immediately following ""bluf"" in the output is always a color. 
In examples 1 and 4, the color following ""bluf"" is the same as the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" (for ""wif"" red and for ""dax"" green). This pattern is again seen in examples 2, 3, and 5, where ""bluf"" precedes the final color that is the same as the one matching the word before ""bluf.""

Based on the above observations, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it repeats the color that corresponds to the word right before it. 

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color corresponding to the previous word.",-0.89560293102,5,bluf
"By examining the occurrences of ""bluf"" in the examples provided, we can induce a rule about its meaning based on the surrounding words (inputs) and the corresponding outputs.

Here is the analysis:

1. wif bluf dax lug -> red red green blue
2. zup bluf lug -> yellow yellow blue
3. zup bluf wif dax wif zup -> yellow yellow red green red yellow
4. dax bluf wif zup lug -> green green red yellow blue
5. dax bluf -> green green

From these examples, it is evident that whenever the word ""bluf"" is present, the word immediately before it dictates the color before ""bluf"" in the output. The word ""bluf"" itself seems to always correspond to the color red. However, there is an exception in the second example, where no word precedes ""zup,"" yet ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output. It is also noted that in all but one example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output, not red. Given that ""green"" is the most consistent output for ""bluf,"" and ""blue"" is an exception, this implies that there might be another rule at play for when ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Based on this analysis, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: When ""bluf"" is preceded by another word, the output is ""green."" When ""bluf"" is not preceded by another word, the output is ""blue.""",-1.1111333267999999,5,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, each input word appears to correspond to a particular color in the output. To determine the meaning of the nonce word 'bluf,' we must identify a consistent pattern for its corresponding color across the different examples. 

By examining each example:

1. Input: wif bluf dax lug
   Output: red red green blue
   - 'bluf' appears between 'wif' and 'dax', with the corresponding colors being 'red' and 'green', respectively. 'Bluf' corresponds to 'red' in the output.

2. Input: zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow yellow blue
   - 'bluf' is situated between 'zup' and 'lug', with the corresponding colors being 'yellow' and 'blue'. However, in this instance, 'bluf' corresponds with the second 'yellow' in the output.

3. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
   Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
   - 'bluf' is located between 'zup' and 'wif', translating to 'yellow' and 'red', respectively, and 'bluf' corresponds to 'yellow' in the output.

4. Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
   Output: green green red yellow blue
   - 'bluf' appears after 'dax' and before 'wif', with their corresponding colors being 'green' and 'red', respectively. In this case, 'bluf' corresponds with 'green' in the output.

5. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   - 'bluf' follows 'dax', which corresponds to 'green'. Similarly, 'bluf' corresponds with 'green'.

In all instances, it appears that 'bluf' adopts the color of the word immediately preceding it. Therefore, the rule for 'bluf' seems to be that it reflects the color associated with the preceding word in the given input sequence.

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to be related to the repetition of the color word that would correspond to the word that precedes ""walm.""

Looking closely:

- In the first input, ""dax walm"" produces ""green green green."" Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and the presence of ""walm"" results in ""green"" being repeated three times.

- In the second input, ""lug walm zup"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The presence of ""walm"" after ""lug"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times.

- In the third input, ""dax zup walm wif walm"" turns into ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" ""Walm"" appears after ""zup"" and ""wif,"" causing ""yellow"" and ""red"" to be repeated three times each.

- In the fourth input, ""zup walm lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the presence of ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" being repeated three times.

- In the fifth input, ""dax walm zup walm"" results in ""green green green yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""walm"" follows both ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" causing each color to be repeated three times.

From these observations, it can be concluded that ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.

"Based on the examples provided, we can observe a pattern in the outputs that correspond to the presence of the nonce word ""walm."" Each time ""walm"" appears, the output consists of a repetition of a color word three times. The specific color word seems to be dependent on a word that appears before ""walm.""

Let's consider each occurrence:

1. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green""
2. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""
3. ""dax zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" (note that ""dax"" is present, but ""zup"" appears right before ""walm"")
4. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow""
5. In the third example, ""walm"" appears twice, resulting in two threefold repetitions of color words: ""yellow yellow yellow red red red."" Since ""zup"" precedes the first ""walm"" and ""wif"" precedes the second, we can assume that ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"" and ""wif"" with ""red.""

The rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the output of three repetitions of a color word, and the specific color output is determined by the word that appears immediately before ""walm."" However, we don't have enough context to definitively determine what color is associated with ""lug"" or ""dax"" when they appear directly before ""walm"" since they are not followed by ""walm"" in the input sequences where other colors are ascribed.

Nonetheless, based on the given data, we can describe ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> When ""walm"" appears in an input sequence, it results in the output of a color word repeated three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, it turns the output into a sequence of three colors that correspond to the preceding word's assigned color. For example:
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" because the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" because the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- When ""walm"" appears multiple times after different words, it repeats the sequence for each distinct preceding word. For instance, ""dax zup walm wif walm"" results in ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red"" repeating the sequence for ""zup"" and ""wif"" after each appearance of ""walm"".",-4.352132488540001,5,walm
"To deduce the meaning of walm, we need to look for patterns in the examples provided. 

It appears that ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color word that comes directly before it. Here are the observations:

1. In ""dax walm"", ""dax"" translates to green, and following ""walm"", the word green is repeated two more times for a total of three green.
2. In ""lug walm zup"", ""lug"" translates to blue, and following ""walm"", the word blue is repeated two more times before a new color word, ""zup,"" appears meaning yellow.
3. In ""dax zup walm wif walm"", ""dax"" translates to green, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""wif"" to red. After ""walm"" is used, the preceding color word is repeated two more times, as seen with green and yellow. Upon the second appearance of ""walm"", the preceding color, red, is also repeated two more times.
4. In ""zup walm lug"", ""zup"" translates to yellow, and after ""walm"", yellow is repeated two more times. Then ""lug"" introduces the blue color.
5. In ""dax walm zup walm"", we see repeated occurrences of green after ""dax walm"" and repeated occurrences of yellow after ""zup walm"".

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""wif"" is used each time there is a change in the color pattern. Here is the analysis for each example:

1) zup bluf wif dax lug corresponds to yellow yellow red green blue
   - ""zup"" is yellow twice, followed by ""bluf"" which is a new word and introduced by ""wif"" indicating a change to red. 
   - Then ""dax"" is green, and ""lug"" is blue.
   
2) dax walm wif walm zup corresponds to green green green red red red yellow
   - ""dax"" is green twice, then ""wif"" indicates a change, ""walm"" turns to red repeated three times, finishing with ""zup"" which is yellow.
   
3) wif lug corresponds to red blue
   - Starting with ""wif"" leads to red and is then followed by ""lug"" which is blue.
   
4) zup walm lug wif corresponds to yellow yellow yellow blue red
   - ""zup"" is repeated as yellow three times, followed by ""walm"" which is blue, then ""lug"" appears and ""wif"" indicates a change to a new color, red.
   
5) wif walm dax zup wif lug walm corresponds to red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   - The sequence starts with ""wif"" leading to red three times, followed by ""dax"" which changes the pattern to green, and ""zup"" to yellow. 
   - Another ""wif"" appears introducing a change to red before ""lug"", then ""walm"" follows which has now changed to blue repeated three times.

Therefore, ""wif"" seems to function as an indicator of a color change. When it appears, the color pattern changes to the color that corresponds to the next word.

Rule: wif -> indicates a change in color pattern to the color corresponding to the next word.",-1.005883452686,6,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" seems to act as a color indicator related to the words that come before or after it. To deduce the exact meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the examples:

2. dax walm wif walm zup -> green green green red red red yellow
3. wif lug -> red blue
4. zup walm lug wif -> yellow yellow yellow blue red
5. wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

Looking at these examples, whenever ""wif"" is present, it corresponds to the color red in the output. Also, it does not change the translation of the other words into colors.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:
wif -> red

Rule: When ""wif"" is present, translate it as ""red"" in the given sequence of colors.",-1.46472524726,6,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" translates to colors in a pattern. To figure out the pattern, let's analyze the number of times colors appear in the output relative to the number of times ""wif"" and other words appear in the input.

In the first example, ""wif"" appears once, and ""red"" appears once in the output.
In the second example, ""wif"" appears once, and ""green"" is repeated three times in the output.
In the third example, ""wif"" appears once, and ""red"" appears once in the output.
In the fourth example, ""wif"" appears once, and ""red"" appears at the end after one instance each of the colors that correspond to the other words in the input.
In the fifth example, ""wif"" appears at the beginning and end, corresponding to two instances of ""red"" at the beginning and one at the end. There are also three instances of the color ""blue"" following the last ""wif,"" which corresponds to the number of times ""walm"" appears after the second ""wif.""

Looking at these examples, it seems reasonable to deduce that ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red,"" but it also may indicate the repetition of the next color in the sequence for the number of times the next word appears after the ""wif.""

Let's test this with the examples:

1. ""zup bluf wif dax lug"" has ""wif"" before ""dax,"" which appears once, so it's just ""red green.""
2. ""dax walm wif walm zup"" has ""wif"" before ""walm,"" which appears twice after ""wif,"" so it's ""green green green red red red.""
3. ""wif lug"" has ""wif"" before ""lug,"" which appears once, so it's ""red blue.""
4. ""zup walm lug wif"" has ""wif"" at the end, and the only word after it is ""lug,"" which is blue, so it's ""yellow yellow yellow blue red.""
5. ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" has ""wif"" at the beginning and ""walm"" appears three times afterward, so it starts with ""red red red;"" then ""wif"" appears again before ""lug,"" which is blue and appears twice after, so it's ""red blue blue blue.""

However, upon closely inspecting example 5, the repetition rule doesn’t consistently explain the outcome—there is an additional ""green"" and ""yellow"" that are not accounted for by ""wif."" So, this rule is not entirely accurate.

Upon even closer inspection, it seems that ""wif"" is actually simply representing ""red"" in all cases regardless of the position or context:

1. ""zup bluf wif dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow red green blue""
2. ""dax walm wif walm zup"" -> each word has a color, and ""wif"" is ""red.""
3. ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue""
4. ""zup walm lug wif"" -> each word has a color, and ""wif"" is ""red.""
5. ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" -> each word has a color, and ""wif"" is ""red.""

- In the fourth input, ""zup"" precedes ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""walm lug."" ""Wif"" has consistently corresponded to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and given the pattern, ""lug"" likely corresponds to ""blue."" Since ""walm"" previously appeared alongside ""zup"" to produce ""yellow,"" it could be inferred that ""walm"" by itself does not denote ""yellow."" The presence of ""zup"" appears to be the determining factor for ""yellow.""
- In the fifth input, ""dax zup bluf,"" if ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""bluf"" to red, then the sequence ""green yellow yellow"" again suggests that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word walm, let's examine the input-output patterns:

1. lug wif dax walm zup
   blue red green green green yellow

2. zup walm
   yellow yellow yellow

3. zup walm
   yellow yellow yellow

4. dax lug dax lug walm
   green blue green blue blue blue

5. lug dax zup dax walm wif
   blue green yellow green green green red

From these examples, we can notice the following patterns:

- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""

Now let's consider where ""walm"" appears:

1. Immediately after ""walm,"" the color ""green"" is repeated twice, then followed by ""yellow.""
2. After ""zup walm,"" we only have ""yellow"" repeated three times.
3. This input is identical to the second one, giving the same output pattern.
4. After ""walm,"" which is preceded by ""lug,"" we have ""blue"" repeated twice.
5. Here, ""walm"" is followed by two greens and then a red (""wif"").

It seems that ""walm"" generates a repetition of the color word preceding it. The number of repetitions appears to be two, independent of the color that precedes it. In the first example, ""green"" is repeated twice because ""dax"" (""green"") comes before ""walm."" In example four, ""lug"" (""blue"") precedes ""walm,"" resulting in two ""blues."" Finally, in example five, ""dax"" (""green"") precedes ""walm,"" followed by two ""greens.""

Since the color immediately before ""walm"" is the one that gets repeated, we can propose the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the immediate preceding color word to be repeated twice in the output sequence.",-1.6573832460999998,6,walm
"Analyzing the given examples:

1. lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow
2. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
3. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
4. dax lug dax lug walm -> green blue green blue blue blue
5. lug dax zup dax walm wif -> blue green yellow green green green red

From the examples, it seems that each word translates to a specific color. However, 'walm' corresponds to a sequence of colors rather than a single color, and the sequence seems to depend on the preceding words. In the first example, 'walm' translates to ""green green,"" following 'dax' and preceding 'zup.' In the second and third examples, 'walm' following 'zup' results in ""yellow yellow."" In the fourth example, we see 'walm' following 'lug dax lug' results in ""blue blue,"" and in the fifth example, 'walm' following 'lug dax zup dax' gives us ""green green.""

Here is one possible rule that could be gleaned:

- 'walm' takes the color of the immediately preceding word and repeats it a number of times based on a specific rule. The specific rule could be related to the number of words preceding 'walm,' or the types of color words that come before it.

Let's test this rule:

- For the first example (lug wif dax walm zup), 'walm' gives us two greens following 'dax,' which means green.
- In the second and third examples (zup walm), 'walm' produces three yellows, following 'zup,' which means yellow.
- In the fourth example (dax lug dax lug walm), 'walm' gives us two blues following 'lug,' which means blue.
- In the fifth example (lug dax zup dax walm wif), 'walm' produces two greens following 'dax,' which means green.

However, this rule doesn't explain why 'walm' produces different numbers of color repetitions in different contexts. Let's consider the number of words before 'walm':

- In examples 2 and 3, there's one word before 'walm' and it repeats the color three times.
- In example 4, there are four words before 'walm,' and it repeats the color twice.
- In example 1 and 5, there's a varied number of words before 'walm' and it is not consistent in the number of times the color is repeated.

Given the inconsistent nature of the repetitions and varying number of preceding words, we need additional data to concretely define the rule. 

That said, here is the possible rule based on available data:

Rule: 'walm' repeats the color of the word directly preceding it, with the repetition count potentially being influenced by a pattern or rule not fully clear from the given examples.

Given the incomplete pattern and limited data, we cannot define a consistent rule for the number of repetitions without additional examples or information.",-1.9166704284200002,6,walm
"To figure out the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I will focus on the relationship of the words before and after ""walm"" and the corresponding colors in the outputs.

Let's analyze the given inputs and outputs:

1. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
   - ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow, but ""walm"" itself is translated to green twice before yellow.

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""walm"" has no words after it but is translated to yellow twice.

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - Same as [2], ""walm"" results in yellow twice.

4. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue
   - Here ""walm"" comes after two pairs of ""dax lug"" and results in ""blue"" being repeated four times.

5. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red
   - ""walm"" follows two occurrences of ""dax"" and results in ""green"" being repeated twice, then followed by ""wif"" which is red.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it. If ""walm"" is the last word in the input, it appears to default to yellow, but this is uncertain without examples of ""walm"" with different trailing contexts.

"Analyzing the examples given, I will try to deduce the pattern for the word ""walm.""

In the first example,
Input: lug wif dax walm zup
Output: blue red green green green yellow

Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" and corresponds to ""green yellow.""

In the second and third examples,
Inputs: zup walm and zup walm
Outputs: yellow yellow yellow and yellow yellow yellow

Here, ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" and always corresponds to ""yellow yellow.""

In the fourth example,
Input: dax lug dax lug walm
Output: green blue green blue blue blue

Here, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue blue.""

In the fifth example,
Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
Output: blue green yellow green green green red

Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and is followed by ""wif,"" with the corresponding output being ""green green.""

From the given examples, there is a clear pattern that every occurrence of ""walm"" corresponds to multiple colors in the output. It seems that ""walm"" duplicates the color that would be assigned to the word that directly follows it:

1. If ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" (which corresponds to ""yellow""), the output is ""green yellow,"" suggesting that the ""green"" corresponds to ""walm"" when following ""zup."" 
2. If ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red""), the output is ""green red,"" aligning with the first example.
3. When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue""), as in the fourth example, the output is ""blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" duplicates ""blue.""
4. However, there is a green preceding every walm regardless of the context, suggesting ""walm"" itself might always correspond to a green output followed by the duplicated color of its successor.

Considering this analysis, we can tentatively conclude the rule is:

- The third example shows ""dax"" at the beginning followed by ""bluf wif zup"" and the output starting with ""green."" Once more, ""dax"" is ""green.""

- In the fifth example, ""dax"" appears twice: after ""walm"" and after ""zup,"" and both times the output for ""dax"" is ""green.""

- 'zup' again corresponds to 'yellow'.

4. Input: lug wif lug **walm** zup **walm** wif
   Output: blue red blue **blue blue** yellow **yellow yellow** red

5. Input: lug **walm** zup wif
   Output: blue **blue blue** yellow red

By analyzing the patterns, it looks like ""walm"" is associated with repeating the color of the word immediately preceding it two or more times. The number of repetitions seems to depend on the word prior to ""walm"":

- **dax** wif walm → red red red (three repetitions)
- lug **walm** wif → blue blue blue (three repetitions)
- lug wif **dax** walm zup → green green (two repetitions)
- lug wif lug **walm** zup **walm** wif → blue blue (two repetitions), yellow yellow (two repetitions)
- lug **walm** zup wif → blue blue (two repetitions)

From this, we can form the rule:

**Rule:** Walm causes the color associated with the word that appears immediately before it to be repeated in the output two or more times, depending on context.

So, the rule for ""walm"" is:

walm -> causes the preceding color word's output to be repeated.",-5.69825329421,7,walm
"To figure out the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at each example and the corresponding outputs.

1. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   - The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" After ""walm,"" there are three ""red"" in a row.
   
2. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" has the same color as ""lug,"" which is ""blue."" ""walm"" here precedes three ""blue.""

3. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" After ""walm,"" the next color is ""green"" three times.

4. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" After the first ""walm,"" there are three ""blue,"" and after the second ""walm,"" there are three ""yellow.""

5. Input: lug walm zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" After ""walm,"" there are three ""blue.""

From these observations, we see that after the word ""walm,"" the following color is repeated three times. Therefore, ""walm"" seems to indicate a repetition of the next color three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the next color three times.",-8.000751717876,7,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the relationship between the input and output for each example given.

1. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   - The first ""red"" follows ""wif"" and ""walm"" is followed by ""red red"".

2. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   - ""walm"" is directly between two ""blue""s, and ""wif"" follows with a ""red"".

3. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
   - ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" which is ""green"" and before ""zup"", which is ""yellow"", and the output has ""green green"" for ""dax walm"".

4. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   - The ""walm"" after ""lug"" generates ""blue blue"", the ""walm"" before ""zup"" generates ""yellow"", and the ""walm"" followed by ""wif"" generates ""yellow yellow red"".

5. Input: lug walm zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red
   - ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" which generates ""blue blue yellow"", and ""wif"" is ""red"" after the ""yellow"".

From the analysis we can induce the following rules for ""walm"":
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"", the corresponding output is an extra ""blue"".
- When ""walm"" is before ""zup"", it corresponds to an extra ""yellow"".
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", it produces an extra ""green"".
- When ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"", there is an extra ""yellow"" before the ""red"".
- ""walm"" seems to duplicate the color associated with the word that comes immediately after it and adds it to the sequence before taking on its own color.

Rule: walm -> duplicates the color of the following word in the sequence and adds it before the sequence continues.",-8.592544799524001,7,walm
"To ascertain what ""walm"" means, let's analyze the patterns in the provided examples:

1. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""wif"" to red. ""Walm"" results in three reds, which is not directly corresponding to any word in the input. Therefore, ""walm"" might mean to repeat the color of the word before it three times.

2. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

   ""Lug"" corresponds to blue and ""wif"" corresponds to red. Following ""walm"", blue is repeated three times. This reinforces the idea that ""walm"" causes the color before it to repeat three times.

3. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow

   Here, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" to red, ""dax"" to green, and ""zup"" to yellow. The word ""walm"" follows ""dax"", and we see green repeats three times, supporting the established pattern.

4. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

   Again, ""walm"" follows ""lug"", and blue is repeated three times. It also follows ""zup"" (yellow) and yellow is repeated three times. Every instance of ""walm"" results in the color before it being repeated three times.

5. Input: lug walm zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red

   As before, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), causing blue to repeat three times. When it follows ""zup"" (yellow), yellow only appears once, but that's because ""wif"" (red) follows, thus ending the repetition sequence.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:
Walm -> Repeats the color of the previous word three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" appears after a colored word, the output should consist of that corresponding color repeated three times.",-10.31536489944,7,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the last word mentioned before walm.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" let's look at the pattern in each example provided.

1. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue."" This suggests that ""lug"" could mean ""blue,"" and ""walm"" also translates to repeating ""blue.""
   
2. ""wif lug"" results in ""red blue."" If we assume ""lug"" means ""blue,"" then ""wif"" would mean ""red.""

3. ""lug wif"" results in ""blue red."" This supports our assumption that ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""wif"" is ""red,"" as reversing their order just reverses the order of the colors.

4. ""dax lug wif walm"" results in ""green blue red red red."" We know ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""wif"" is ""red,"" which leaves ""dax"" meaning ""green"" and ""walm"" as a repetition of the color it follows, which in this case is ""red.""

5. The final example ""lug walm"" also results in ""blue blue blue,"" which supports the idea that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it.

Rule: lug -> ""blue""",-1.2077628086460002,8,lug
"lug -> meaning. Meaning can be inferred as coloring counts based on the word 'lug' and its position.

Rule: 'lug' translates to the color blue, and it also dictates a repetition of the subsequent color. When 'lug' precedes a color word, that color is repeated as many times as 'lug' implies. Here’s the breakdown:

- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue."" Since ""walm"" is not previously defined, we assume it represents the color blue, and because ""lug"" requires a repetition, the result is three blues.
  
- ""wif lug"" outputs ""red blue."" This means that ""wif"" translates to red, and ""lug"" is again represented by blue. The order here is important; no repetition is indicated because lug appears after ""wif.""

- ""lug wif"" outputs ""blue red."" The order again influences the output; ""lug"" is blue and ""wif"" is red. Here though, ""lug"" didn't cause a repetition, likely because it was before ""wif,"" as seen in the previous example.

- ""dax lug wif walm"" outputs ""green blue red red red."" ""Dax"" introduces a new color green, followed by ""lug"" which is blue and should trigger a repetition of the following colors. ""Wif"" is red and appears after ""lug,"" so it is repeated. ""Walm"" is assumed to be blue from the first example, and its repetition is already accounted for by the preceding ""lug,"" thus resulting in three reds instead of repeating blue.

- ""lug walm"" is repeated for confirmation and consistency checks, which reaffirms that ""lug"" leads to the repetition of ""walm,"" which is blue.

The overarching rule seems to be that 'lug' means blue and causes the immediate next color word to repeat itself. If there is no color word immediately after 'lug,' it simply translates to blue.",-1.3849072962200002,8,lug
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""lug"" represents the color blue regardless of its position within the input sequence. Consequently, every occurrence of ""lug"" in the input results in ""blue"" in the corresponding output.

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's examine the patterns in which this word appears and their corresponding outputs:

2. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""
3. ""wif zup"" -> ""red yellow""
4. ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red""
5. ""dax zup dax zup wif"" -> ""green yellow green yellow red""

Let's analyze the pattern:

- Whenever the word ""wif"" appears, the word ""red"" appears in the output.
- The word ""wif"" is always followed by the word ""red"" in the output, no matter its position in the input.
- The presence, position, or the number of other words do not affect the ""red"" that corresponds to ""wif.""

- If ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""
- If ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""green.""

However, this rule does not hold for the second example, where ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" but the output is ""yellow yellow"" instead of just ""yellow.""

Given the inconsistency in the second example, it may be necessary to consider an alternative rule, or it is possible that there is an error in that example. With the given data, we can only derive a rule that is somewhat but not entirely consistent.

In the fourth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to red after ""wif,"" and yellow after ""zup.""
In the fifth example, ""bluf"" after ""wif"" corresponds to red, and it corresponds to green after ""dax.""

The rule that can be established from these examples is that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes it:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is red.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is yellow.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is green.

"Observing the given examples, we can try to identify the pattern associated with the nonce word 'bluf' and its corresponding color outputs.

From the first example:
Input: wif zup dax bluf

'bluf' corresponds to 'green'

From the second example:
Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

'bluf' follows 'zup', which also corresponds to 'yellow', while 'bluf' itself corresponds to a different color, 'red'. However, we notice that when followed by 'walm', 'bluf' corresponds to 'red' twice, which might suggest that 'bluf' duplicates the color of whatever the last word was.

From the third example:
Input: dax bluf

'bluf' follows 'dax', which corresponds to 'green', and 'bluf' also corresponds to 'green', again suggesting duplication.

Again, 'bluf' seems to duplicate the color associated with the word prior to it.

From the last example:
Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax

In the sequence “wif bluf dax,” the 'bluf' duplicates the 'red' color associated with 'wif', and does not turn 'green' even though 'dax' follows it. This further supports the idea of duplication.

- In the second example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue blue,"" again showing that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word, ""lug,"" which means blue.

- In the third example, ""lug bluf dax bluf"" translates to ""blue blue green green,"" where ""bluf"" first takes on the color of ""lug"" (blue), and then the color of ""dax"" (green).

- In the fourth example, ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow,"" so ""bluf"" takes on the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" changes its meaning dependent on the word that precedes it. The pattern shown in the outputs can help us deduce the rule. Here is the analysis by example:

- ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red"", which suggests that ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" when following ""wif"".
- ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" becomes ""blue blue blue red blue blue"", and the ""bluf"" here again follows ""lug"", giving us another ""blue"". However, the first ""blue blue"" are influenced by ""lug walm"" which suggests ""walm"" might not change the color but ""lug"" does translate to ""blue"".
- ""lug bluf dax bluf"" becomes ""blue blue green green"", where ""bluf"" after ""lug"" is ""blue"", and ""bluf"" after ""dax"" is ""green"".
- ""dax zup bluf"" becomes ""green yellow yellow"", which indicates that ""bluf"" after ""zup"" is ""yellow"".
- ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" generates ""yellow red green red red"", showing that ""bluf"" following ""wif"" is again ""red"".

Given these examples, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes it with the following mappings:
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow

So, ""bluf"" following any of these words will output the color associated with the preceding word.",-1.251317812202,9,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns before and after ""bluf"" in the inputs and outputs:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and turns into ""red.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and turns into ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is both preceded and followed by ""lug dax,"" turning into ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" and turns into ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif dax wif"" and turns into ""red.""

It seems that ""bluf"" takes on a color based on the word immediately before it:

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow

So, the general rule for ""bluf"" seems to be: ""bluf"" is a placeholder for a color word that changes depending on the word directly before it, according to the rules above.

"Examining the input and output sequences, it seems that ""bluf"" directly translates to a color name in the output. Specifically, based on the patterns where it occurs, ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color that is mentioned after the last color word before ""bluf"". Here's how we deduce this:

- In the first input (""wif bluf""), ""wif"" leads to ""red"" in the output. Since ""wif"" is the last color word before ""bluf"", ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" in the output.
- In the second input (""lug walm wif lug bluf""), ""lug"" is the last color word before ""bluf"" and translates to ""blue"". Hence, ""bluf"" is also ""blue"" in the output.
- In the third input (""lug bluf dax bluf""), ""lug"" is the last color word before the first ""bluf"" and translates to ""blue"", so the first ""bluf"" is ""blue"". Then, ""dax"" is the last color word before the second ""bluf"", translating to ""green"", so the second ""bluf"" is also ""green"".
- In the fourth input (""dax zup bluf""), ""zup"" is the last color word before ""bluf"" and translates to ""yellow"". Therefore, ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" in the output.
- In the fifth input (""zup wif dax wif bluf""), ""wif"" is the last color word before ""bluf"" and translates to ""red"". Thus, ""bluf"" is ""red"" in the output.

   - Here, ""zup"" corresponds to a single ""yellow,"" and the presence of ""walm"" results in three ""yellow.""

2. Input: ""dax wif walm lug zup""

   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""
   - After the word ""walm,"" the ""red"" is repeated three times, similar to how ""yellow"" was repeated in the previous example.

3. Input: ""lug walm zup wif""
   Output: ""blue blue blue yellow red""
   - The colors follow the identified pattern for their corresponding words, except after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times.

4. Input: ""wif walm lug bluf""
   Output: ""red red red blue blue""
   - ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and there is no known word for ""bluf,"" but it outputs ""blue"" too.

- In the first example, ""wif"" outputs ""red,"" and when ""bluf"" is provided after ""wif,"" the output is ""red red.""
- In the third example, ""lug bluf"" outputs ""blue blue,"" and ""lug"" alone outputs ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax bluf wif"" outputs ""green blue red,"" where ""dax"" outputs ""green"" and ""wif"" outputs ""red,"" so ""bluf"" takes the color of the word before it (dax -> green) and follows it with a blue, then the next word, ""wif,"" outputs ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug bluf"" outputs ""blue blue,"" adhering to the explanation that ""bluf"" is the preceding color (""lug"" -> blue) followed by blue.

However, there is an odd case in the second example where ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" outputs ""yellow green yellow green red red"" instead of what you would expect if the rule were consistent, which would be ""yellow green yellow green red blue."" This might suggest the rule is inconsistent, or it could be a typographical error.

In summary, the rule seems to be: Bluf outputs the color of the preceding word and then ""blue."" If there is no preceding color word, it defaults to ""blue blue.""

In the second example, ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow"". But ""walm"" is surrounded by ""zup"" and ""lug"" and leads to three ""yellow"".

- wif corresponds with red
- lug corresponds with blue
- dax corresponds with green
- zup corresponds with yellow

With these associations, we can then look specifically at what happens when ""walm"" is introduced in each input:

1. In the first input, when ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is an additional set of ""green"" that repeats the same number of times as ""walm"" appears in the input (3 times).
2. Similarly, in the second input, when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the word ""yellow"" (which corresponds to ""zup"") is repeated in the output the same number of times as ""walm"" appears.

In the fourth and fifth inputs, ""wif"" also maps to ""red"" consistently, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.

Based on these examples, there are consistent mappings of each word to a specific color and there is no indication that 'wif' changes in meaning based on context. The output color for 'wif' is consistently ""red"" in all given contexts.

"Based on the given examples, we need to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""zup."" We will look for patterns in the input and output pairs.

Input: zup
Output: yellow

Here, ""zup"" is the only word in the input and the output is ""yellow."" Thus, ""zup"" directly translates to ""yellow"" in this instance.

Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

From this, it seems ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red."" ""Zup"" appears twice and both times it translates to ""yellow.""

Input: lug wif zup wif walm

Rule: zup -> yellow,-8.835688497547999,11,zup
"To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" I will look for patterns in each example:

- In the first input, ""zup"" stands alone and the output is ""yellow,"" suggesting ""zup"" might mean ""yellow.""

- In the subsequent examples, each instance of ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow,"" regardless of the surrounding words.

Thus, the meaning of ""zup"" seems to be consistent across all examples. The rule based on the given inputs and outputs is as follows:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",-10.130125026512,11,zup
"To deduce the meaning or rule behind ""bluf,"" let's analyze the correlation between the input and output in each example.

1. Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output.
2. Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output.
3. Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output.
4. Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output.
5. The word ""walm"" seems to replicate the preceding color in the output.

Now, let's focus on the occurrences of ""bluf."" Looking through the examples:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", ""red red"" appears in the output (Example 1).
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug zup"", ""yellow yellow"" comes after ""blue"" (Example 2).
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", ""yellow yellow"" comes after ""yellow"" (Example 3).
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif lug wif walm lug"", and the output has ""blue red blue red red red blue"" which has an added ""blue"" (the color corresponding to ""lug"") at the beginning.
- In the last example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax walm,"" and the output has ""green green"" after ""red,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" has caused the color corresponding to ""dax"" (green) to be replicated as well.

From these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" causes the following:
- The color corresponding to the immediately following word to be duplicated an extra time.
- If ""bluf"" is at the end of the input, it repeats the last color obtained.

Therefore, we can deduce the rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" causes the next color word in the output to be repeated once more. If ""bluf"" is followed by ""walm,"" it repeats the color that was last listed before ""walm."" If there is no next color word, the last color is repeated instead.",-4.668280214952,11,bluf
"Observing the relationship between the input and the output in each example, we notice that the word ""bluf"" causes a duplication of the color that corresponds to the immediately following word. Let's look at each instance where ""bluf"" occurs and the ensuing output:

Example 1: ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"".
Example 2: ""lug zup bluf dax"" has ""bluf"" before ""dax"", hence ""green green"" after ""yellow"".
Example 3: ""zup bluf wif"" sees ""bluf"" before ""wif"", thus ""red red"" follows ""yellow"".
Example 4: ""lug bluf wif"" has ""bluf"" before ""wif"", hence ""red red"" after ""blue"", and the same pattern applies for the second instance of ""wif"" and so on.
Example 5: ""wif bluf dax"" results in ""red red green"" where ""bluf"" is directly before ""dax"", causing the ""green"" to duplicate.

Based on these observations, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: bluf -> causes the next color word to be duplicated in the output.",-7.3382594619,11,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to find a consistent pattern from the examples given.

From the first example:
Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

Here, ""bluf"" is directly followed by a repetition of a color.

From the second example:
Input: lug zup bluf dax
Output: blue yellow yellow green

The word ""bluf"" leads to the repetition of the color that precedes it.

From the third example:
Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

""Bluf"" is followed by the repetition of the preceding color, and we see that repetition is consistent even if the following words change.

From the fourth example:
Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

Again, ""bluf"" causes the preceding color to be repeated once.

From the fifth example:
Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

""Bluf"" is followed by a repeated sequence of the color that precedes it, again confirming the pattern.

Putting all of this together, it seems that ""bluf"" indicates that the color corresponding to the word before ""bluf"" should be repeated. Thus, we can conclude the rule for ""bluf"" as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word that comes before ""bluf.""",-8.006419239445998,11,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word. If there is no previous word, repeat the color of the following word.",-10.46905763258,11,bluf

"Based on the examples provided, each instance of ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color word that follows. In cases where ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence and there is no following color word, it repeats the last mentioned color word. With this in mind, here are the interpretations for each example:

1. In ""wif zup bluf lug walm,"" ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug,"" which outputs as ""blue blue blue.""

2. In ""zup walm,"" ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup,"" which outputs as ""yellow yellow yellow.""

3. In ""lug walm,"" ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug,"" which outputs as ""blue blue blue.""

4. In ""zup lug walm wif dax,"" ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" before moving on to ""wif"" and ""dax,"" which output as ""red"" and ""green"" respectively.

5. In ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup,"" the first ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif,"" resulting in tripling ""red."" The sequence continues with ""yellow"" for ""zup"" and ""blue"" for ""lug."" After ""wif,"" the second ""walm"" again repeats the color of ""wif,"" leading to ""red red red,"" followed by ""yellow"" for the final ""zup.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

"walm -> the color represented by the word immediately preceding it.

"Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""dax."" 

Looking at the first two examples:
- ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" translates to ""blue red red green blue blue,"" and 
- ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green.""

In these examples, ""dax"" seems to precede a color word and results in the word ""green."" In the second example, though ""dax"" follows ""bluf,"" both are translated as ""green."" This suggests ""dax"" directly translates to ""green,"" as its placement doesn't seem to affect its meaning.

The third example:
- ""wif dax"" is translated to ""red green.""

Here, ""wif"" apparently translates to ""red"" and is followed by ""dax,"" which is consistent with the previous examples, where ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

The fourth and fifth examples:
- ""dax walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue blue blue,"" and
- ""dax walm zup"" translates to ""green green green yellow.""

In both cases, ""dax"" appears at the start and is translated to ""green."" Based on these examples, the instances of ""dax"" continue to result in ""green,"" regardless of preceding or following words. The word ""walm,"" which follows ""dax,"" is translated as ""green"" when next to ""dax"" but as ""blue"" when it appears later in the sequence, suggesting a contextual dependence for the translation of ""walm"" but not ""dax.""

Considering all of this information, the rule associated with the word ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: ""dax"" translates to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position or context within the sequence of words. 

Therefore:

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we need to examine the provided examples to identify a pattern. Let's analyze the input and output combinations.

Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
Output: blue red red green blue blue

The sequence ""lug bluf"" appears at the beginning and the end of the input. Its corresponding output is ""blue blue"" both times. Therefore, we can infer that ""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" likely maps to ""blue"" as well. ""Wif"" appears once and corresponds to ""red.""

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green

Since ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue,"" the presence of ""dax"" leading to ""green green"" suggests that ""dax"" also maps to ""green.""

Input: wif dax
Output: red green

Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" once again corresponds to ""green.""

Input: dax walm zup lug walm
Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

We know ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" The word ""walm"" appears twice at the end, and we see ""blue blue blue"" at the end of the output, which could imply that ""walm"" maps to ""blue."" Since ""zup"" is followed by three occurrences of ""green"" in the output, ""zup"" could correspond to ""yellow.""

Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow

In this example, ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" ""walm"" is followed by another ""green,"" and ""zup"" maps to ""yellow.""

Similarly, 'dax' leads to ""green"" in the first and third examples but ""green"" in the second one.

5. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   - bluf follows ""wif"" and again, the output is red, consistent with the color for ""wif"".

Based on these observations, the rule for 'bluf' appears to be:

bluf -> Takes the color of the preceding word.",-4.8497497250879995,12,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each instance of ""bluf"" corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output.

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look at each example and identify a pattern that can be connected to the output.

Observing the outputs following the word ""bluf"", it seems that ""bluf"" is translated to ""red"" in every instance. To confirm this, we should check whether this meaning consistently applies across all given examples:

5. ""dax walm wif bluf"" -> ""green green green red red""

Observing the patterns:

- When ""walm"" appears, multiple ""reds"" follow in the output.
- ""Walm"" does not generate a single color; instead, it precedes a sequence of the same color.
- The number of ""reds"" following ""walm"" correlates with the number of words following ""walm"" in the input. For instance, in example 1, there are no more words after ""walm,"" hence it outputs a sequence of ""reds"" that match the number of words preceding it.

Combining these observations, ""walm"" seems to create a sequence of ""red"" in the output equivalent to the number of words that follow ""walm,"" including itself as one count. If ""walm"" is at the end of the input, it creates a sequence of ""reds"" that match the number of words preceding ""walm."" Therefore:

"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" appears to be associated with a color. Moreover, it seems that the color indicated by the nonce word ""walm"" is directly influenced by the word that precedes it. We can analyze each example for patterns:

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red
Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which translates to ""red,"" so the next ""red"" in the sequence is produced by ""walm.""

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" resulting in another ""blue.""

Input: lug walm zup lug walm
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
Both instances of ""walm"" here follow ""lug"" (blue), leading to repeats of ""blue"" again.

Input: dax lug wif walm
Output: green blue red red red
Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" yielding another ""red"" for ""walm.""

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red
Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which translates to ""green,"" and accordingly, ""walm"" produces another ""green.""

From these observations, we can conclude that ""walm"" replicates the color of the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color associated with the word that precedes it.",-7.951256054788,12,walm
"Given the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes a repeated output of the color immediately preceding it until a new color word is encountered or the sequence ends. Therefore, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"" as follows:

walm -> Repeat the color immediately preceding ""walm"" until a different color-indicating word appears or the sequence ends.

For example, in ""lug wif walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" After ""wif"" comes ""walm,"" which causes the output ""red"" to be repeated. The output sequence stops when there are no more words to process. Thus:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color.",-10.263290278060001,12,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the color ""blue"" to repeat for an amount of times that is one less than the number of letters in the preceding word. Here is the rule induction based on each example:

1. In ""lug wif walm,"" ""wif"" has three letters, and ""walm"" translates to ""red red red,"" which is three repetitions of ""red.""

2. For ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug,"" ""lug"" has three letters, following which ""walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" again three repetitions of ""blue.""

3. In ""lug walm zup lug walm,"" the first ""lug"" before ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" - three times ""blue"" for the three-letter ""lug."" The second ""lug"" before ""walm"" leads to the same repetition.

4. ""dax lug wif walm"" has ""wif"" before ""walm,"" resulting in ""red red red,"" which is three times ""red"" due to the three-letter ""wif.""

5. Finally, ""dax walm wif bluf"" presents ""walm"" after ""dax,"" which results in ""green green green,"" three times ""green"" mirroring the three letters in ""dax.""

So, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" is: Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word a number of times equal to the number of letters in that word minus one.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the output color corresponding to the previous word, as many times as there are letters in the previous word minus one.",-11.08197132772,12,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" is associated with the word ""blue"" repeated multiple times. However, the number of times the word ""blue"" is repeated corresponds to the number of words preceding ""walm"" in the input sequence.

- ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red,"" where the first ""red"" follows ""wif.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.",-8.22806955712,13,zup
"Based on the given examples, when translating from the input to the output, the word ""zup"" consistently correlates to the color ""yellow.""

2. When ""lug"" is mentioned, the output is ""blue.""
3. When ""dax"" is mentioned, the output is ""green.""
4. When ""wif"" is mentioned, the output is ""red.""

Now, let's analyze the usage of ""bluf"":

- In the first example, we observe ""bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow blue.""
- In the second example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" showing that ""bluf"" has yielded ""blue"" when next to ""lug.""
- The third example shows ""bluf dax"" translating to ""red green,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" does not consistently correspond to ""red.""
- The fourth example shows ""bluf zup bluf"" translating to ""green yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""bluf"" can transform into ""green"" when adjacent to ""dax"" or into ""yellow"" when adjacent to ""zup.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" yields ""blue"" when adjacent to ""lug.""

So, considering the consistency of ""lug""->""blue"" and ""zup""->""yellow,"" we can deduce that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word it is next to or adjacent to. Whenever ""bluf"" follows or is followed by ""lug,"" it translates to ""blue."" Similarly, it seems to take on the color associated with ""dax"" and ""zup"" when they are adjacent. There's not enough information about ""wif"" adjacent to ""bluf"" to make a concrete rule, so it doesn't help in deducing.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" could be that it takes on the color of the immediately preceding or following nonce word.

- In the second example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""yellow"" from ""zup"" is repeated thrice following ""walm.""

- In the second example, ""zup"" maps to yellow, and the output after ""walm"" is three yellows, again repeating the color.

- For ""lug walm,"" the single ""lug"" becomes three blues.

- ""Wif lug walm"" has ""lug"" before ""walm"" again, resulting in three blues after the color for ""wif,"" which is red.

4. Input: lug wif zup wif walm

5. Input: zup wif walm lug

Looking at the examples, ""walm"" always generates the color red and adds more reds to the output, seemingly proportional to the number of words before ""walm"" in the input. For instance:

- When ""walm"" is the fourth word (Example 1), there are three green outputs followed by two red outputs, suggesting possibly that ""walm"" ends a sequence and adds reds based on some of the previous words.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" directly (Examples 3 and 5), it always generates an extra red for itself and for the word ""wif"" before it.
- In Example 4, ""walm"" is at the end again but after two instances of ""wif,"" each generating a red color and ""walm"" adding two more reds to the sequence.

2. wif bluf -> red red
3. wif zup bluf lug -> red yellow yellow blue
4. wif zup -> red yellow
5. dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> green blue yellow red red green

From these examples, ""wif"" seems to consistently result in the output ""red."" This suggests that ""wif"" means ""red"" or corresponds to the color red.

To check our hypothesis, we should look at the other words too:

- ""dax"" appears three times and results in ""green"" each time.
- ""bluf"" appears three times and results in ""red"" twice and ""blue"" once.
- ""zup"" appears three times and results in ""yellow"" each time.
- ""lug"" appears twice and results in ""blue"" each time.
- ""walm"" appears once and results in ""green.""

The word ""bluf"" is the only one that does not have a consistent color associated with it. However, when it comes after ""wif,"" it is ""red,"" which might indicate that ""bluf"" on its own would mean ""blue,"" and when preceded by ""wif,"" it repeats the color associated with ""wif."" Therefore, ""bluf"" is yellow by itself and gets transformed to ""red"" when it follows ""wif."" But since it is consistently associated with ""blue,"" we could potentially have a situation where ""bluf"" means ""blue,"" but when ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the preceding color (""red"" in this case) takes precedence.

Analysis:
- ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue.""
- ""walm"" seems to be extending the ""blue"" by two additional instances.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
Analysis:
- ""zup"" is not defined in other examples but possibly translates to ""yellow.""

Analysis:
- ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- Followed sequence: ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red.""
- Following the pattern, ""walm"" appears to extend the ""red"" from ""wif"" by two more instances.

Rule:
The pattern suggests that ""walm"" takes the color of the word directly preceding it and repeats that color two more times in the output.

From the first example, ""wif dax"" translates to ""red green."" The word ""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green,"" because whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, ""green"" is in the output.

From the second example, ""wif"" seems to come before every original color mentioned, and ""walm"" seems to duplicate the previous color since ""walm"" after ""wif"" leads to repeating ""red.""

However, there appears to be an error in the sequences provided in the outputs.

"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we should look for patterns before and after ""wif"" in the examples, and how they relate to the colors in the output.

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let us compare the color outputs to the inputs containing ""bluf.""

1. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
2. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red
3. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
4. dax bluf -> green green
5. lug bluf wif -> blue blue red

We should identify any patterns related to the presence of ""bluf"" and the corresponding colors:

- In examples 1 and 4, ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"" and the output is green followed by green.
- In example 2, we have both ""dax"" and ""wif"" with ""bluf"" and the output includes three greens and two reds.
- In example 3, ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"" and then ""wif"" and ""walm"". The output is two yellows and three reds.
- In example 5, ""lug"" is with ""bluf"" and ""wif,"" resulting in two blues and a red.

From these examples, it seems that the presence of ""bluf"" causes the first color in the output to be repeated. So if ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" we see green twice. If it follows ""zup,"" we see yellow twice, and if it follows ""lug,"" we see blue twice.

With this rule in mind, here is the deduced meaning of ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word preceding it.

So when ""bluf"" follows:
- ""dax,"" the output color is green repeated.
- ""zup,"" the output color is yellow repeated.
- ""lug,"" the output color is blue repeated.
- When followed by ""wif"" or ""walm,"" additional colors (red) are introduced, but the repetition of the preceding color due to ""bluf"" remains consistent.",-1.7118770362999995,16,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""bluf."" 

In the examples, every time the word ""bluf"" appears, it is translated into two colors in the output. The colors associated with ""bluf"" seem to depend on the word that precedes it. Let's analyze this relationship:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green.""
- In the third example, ""zup bluf"" again results in ""yellow yellow,"" which is consistent with the first example.
- In the second and fifth examples, ""bluf"" is proceeded by new words (""walm"" and ""lug""), and each time, the color sequence changes.

Notice that the color before the sequences that include ""bluf"" is a single repetition of the color output associated with the word that comes before ""bluf."" This pattern suggests that ""bluf"" might indicate a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. However, this rule does not hold true for the second example, which features an additional color (red), so there is another element at play.

Additionally, ""bluf"" appears to be linked with a doubling of the color output associated with the word that comes immediately before it in the input. This is evident in all the examples except for the second one where ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and instead of a double color repetition, we have a sequence of ""red red,"" which deviates from the established pattern of the preceding word.

However, considering the examples provided, the most consistent rule we can induce is:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated in the output.

Based on this rule induction:

bluf -> Causes the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word in the sequence.

This understanding still leaves the deviation in the second example unexplained, but with the limited data provided, this is the most consistent rule we can deduce for ""bluf.""",-5.428518098540001,16,bluf
"Bluf -> reduplicating the color associated with the preceding word. Rule:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color green is reduplicated.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color yellow is reduplicated.
- When ""walm"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color red is reduplicated.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color blue is reduplicated.

Thus, the color indicated by the word directly prior to ""bluf"" is repeated an additional time.",-5.97721968814,16,bluf
"Based on the outputs corresponding to the presence of ""bluf"" in the inputs, it appears that ""bluf"" directly translates to repeating the color indicated by the previous word. So, if ""dax"" means green, then ""bluf"" after ""dax"" yields two greens. If ""lug"" means blue, then ""bluf"" after ""lug"" yields two blues. 

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" causes the duplication of the color code of the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> Duplicate the color code of the preceding word.",-7.236491020052,16,bluf
"walm -> repetition of the color associated with the previous word(s). Rule: The word ""walm"" indicates that the color associated with the previous word should be repeated a number of times equal to the total number of words before ""walm"" plus one. Here are the associations derived from the examples:

- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" must be associated with the color yellow, and since ""zup"" is one word, the color is repeated twice (for a total of three times, counting the initial occurrence).

- When ""dax lug"" precede ""walm,"" the output is ""green blue blue blue."" ""Lug"" must be associated with blue, and since ""dax lug"" are two words, the color blue is repeated three times.

- ""wif walm dax"" has the output ""red red red green."" Since ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""dax"", ""wif"" is associated with the color red. ""Walm"" causes the repetition of red three times (because ""wif"" is a single word), followed by the color associated with ""dax,"" which is green.

- ""wif lug walm"" results in ""red blue blue blue."" Here ""lug"" is associated with blue, and since ""wif lug"" are two words, the color blue is repeated three times after the color associated with ""wif,"" which is red.",-0.88865502954,16,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" dictates the following rule for the output:

- The output consists of a repeated color word. The number of repetitions equals the number of syllables in the word preceding ""walm"". 

Analyzing the examples:

1. ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow"". ""Zup"" has one syllable, so ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
2. ""dax lug walm"" outputs ""green blue blue blue"". ""Lug"" has one syllable, so ""blue"" is repeated four times (in combination with ""green"" from ""dax"").
3. ""zup walm"" (repeated example) outputs ""yellow yellow yellow"" again, maintaining consistency.
4. ""wif walm dax"" outputs ""red red red green"". ""Wif"" has one syllable, so ""red"" is repeated three times, followed by ""green"" which is associated with ""dax"".
5. ""wif lug walm"" outputs ""red blue blue blue"". ""Lug"" has one syllable, so ""blue"" is repeated four times, preceded by ""red"" from ""wif"".

However, there seems to be a consistency in color assignment for words that are not ""walm"":

- ""zup"" is consistently associated with ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" is consistently associated with ""green.""
- ""wif"" is consistently associated with ""red.""
- ""lug"" causes a repetition of the color associated with it; in the given examples, it is always followed by ""walm,"" leading to a repetition of ""blue.""

Therefore, ""walm"" could be functioning as a modifier that indicates repetition based on the syllable count of the preceding word, and the reason for the specific color choices may be determined by other latent rules or associations that are not explicitly clear from the examples given.

Rule: walm -> A modifier that induces the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. The number of repetitions equals the number of syllables in that word.",-0.985472244782,16,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can analyze the patterns provided:

1. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow""
2. ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue""
3. ""zup walm"" (repeats) results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" (consistent with 1.)
4. ""wif walm dax"" results in ""red red red green""
5. ""wif lug walm"" results in ""red blue blue blue""

From the examples given, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the word that just precedes it a certain number of times. Here's the breakdown:

- In 1 and 3, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" being repeated three times.
- In 2, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated four times.
- In 4, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", but ""walm"" does not repeat the ""red"" three times because the sequence is followed by another color word, ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"". This suggests that the presence of another color word after ""walm"" affects the pattern, possibly completing ""walm""s pattern with the new color word.
- In 5, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated four times, which is consistent with example 2.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be: ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately prior to it, unless another color word follows ""walm"". How many times the color is repeated may depend on the rule associated with the preceding word rather than ""walm"" itself, but with the examples provided, it is not clear what determines the number of repetitions.

Therefore, the rule is:

walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: Walm causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated, unless another color word immediately follows ""walm"".",-1.40356823286,16,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" look at the patterns of the output in relation to the input:

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue

From the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it, repeated the number of times equal to the total number of words in the input minus one. This deduction is made as follows:

- In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow."" Since there are only two words in the input, ""walm"" results in the color ""yellow"" being repeated three times.
- In ""dax lug walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" There are three words in the input, so ""walm"" results in the last color mentioned (""blue"") being repeated four times.
- In ""wif walm dax,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" This time ""walm"" is between ""wif"" and ""dax,"" and it generates ""red"" three times, followed by ""green"" once. Since ""walm"" is in the middle, it seems to repeat the color before it until the last word, which provides the final color.
- In ""wif lug walm,"" the pattern holds with ""walm"" repeating the color ""blue"" associated with ""lug"" four times because there are three words in the input.

Thus, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the output to consist of the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated for the output count, which is one more than the count of words in the input, except for the last word which determines the final color.

However, since ""walm"" always comes at the end of the inputs except for the ""wif walm dax"" case, there could be ambiguity about whether the repetition is solely due to the position of ""walm"" or its effect within the context. But given the consistency of the examples, we can be reasonably confident in the rule deduction.",-6.425296995083,16,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of a color word that is associated with another word in the input. Let's analyze the examples:

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" seems to represent the repetition of the color associated with ""zup"" three times.

2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

In this example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" Thus, ""walm"" seems to indicate repeating the color associated with the word immediately before it four times (as ""lug"" is right in front of ""walm"").

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

This instance is a repeat of the first example, further cementing the relationship between ""zup"" and the color ""yellow"" and its repetition.

4. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

Here, ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" and ""walm"" again seems to indicate repetition. However, since ""dax"" (which correlates to ""green"") appears after ""walm,"" ""walm"" only repeats the color associated with ""wif"" three times before the pattern is interrupted by a new color.

5. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue

In this case, ""wif"" is associated with ""red"", ""lug"" with ""blue"", and ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color related to ""lug"" since ""lug"" is the word before ""walm."" 

Given these observations, the rule can be inferred as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Indicates the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. The number of repetitions appears to be equal to one plus the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence (counting from one). For example, if ""walm"" is the second word, the color repeats twice. If ""walm"" is the third word, the color repeats three times, and so forth. If a new color word is presented after ""walm"", it ends the repetition pattern and states the color associated with that word.

"To induce the rule for the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at each example and search for a pattern:

1. When ""dax walm zup lug dax"" is inputted, the output is ""green green green yellow blue green."" The word ""dax"" appears twice, and both times it outputs ""green.""

2. When the input is only ""dax walm,"" the output remains ""green green green."" Given that ""walm"" is followed by ""green green,"" it suggests ""dax"" might mean ""green.""

3. ""dax zup"" results in ""green yellow."" Here again ""dax"" correlates with ""green.""

4. In ""dax bluf wif zup lug,"" we have ""green green red yellow blue."" Again ""dax"" aligns with ""green.""

5. The repetition of ""dax zup"" yielding ""green yellow"" reinforces the previously observed pattern.

From these examples, it seems that the occurrence of the word ""dax"" consistently correlates with the color ""green."" Thus, it appears the rule that can be induced is that the nonce word ""dax"" represents the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green",-1.1792543949799998,18,dax
"The examples suggest that ""dax"" defines a color sequence rule rather than a single static meaning. Observing the inputs and corresponding outputs, we can attempt to determine the associations between the nonce words and the colors:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears by itself or as the first word, it outputs ""green.""
- Following ""dax,"" different words seem to correspond to different colors:
  - ""walm"" seems consistently to output ""green.""
  - ""zup"" outputs ""yellow.""
  - ""bluf"" may correspond to ""red"" (observed in example 4).
  - ""lug"" outputs ""blue.""
  
With the information provided, it appears ""dax"" operates as an initiator of color sequences and might represent the start of the color pattern with ""green"" always as the first color:

Rule: ""dax"" represents the start of a color sequence, with the following words dictating subsequent colors in the sequence. The first occurrence of ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and other colors depend on the words following ""dax."" 

Therefore, we can deduce:

dax -> initiates a color sequence starting with green. Subsequent colors are determined by subsequent words.",-4.4939331635799995,18,dax
"To deduce the rule for ""dax,"" let's examine the inputs and the corresponding outputs:

- In every example where ""dax"" appears, the output starts with ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" the color ""green"" is repeated three times.
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""zup,"" the color ""yellow"" follows the initial ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the color ""red"" comes after the first ""green.""

Given these observations, it seems that ""dax"" signifies the start of a sequence and is represented by ""green."" The colors that follow ""dax"" depend on the subsequent word:

- ""walm"" seems to cause repetition of the color ""green.""
- ""zup"" introduces the color ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" brings in the color ""red.""
- The other colors (blue in the first example and again with ""lug"") could possibly represent other words not preceded by ""dax.""

Based on this, the rule for ""dax"" is:

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" is mentioned, the color sequence starts with ""green,"" and subsequent colors depend on the words that follow ""dax.""",-4.8191498929700005,18,dax
"To deduce the meaning or rules of the nonce word ""dax,"" we need to look at the consistency of the output in relation to the use of ""dax"" in the inputs:

- Whenever ""dax"" is present, at least one green appears in the output.
- ""dax"" is always followed by at least one more green in the output regardless of the following word.
- ""dax"" itself does not seem to determine the color after the first green (since both ""zup"" and ""walm"" follow ""dax"" in various inputs, but the outputs are different in terms of colors following the initial greens).

Looking at the examples:

- Input: dax walm zup lug dax → Output: green green green yellow blue green
  Here ""dax"" is followed by two greens, and when repeated, another green follows.

- Input: dax walm → Output: green green green
  Again, ""dax"" is followed by two greens.

- Input: dax zup → Output: green yellow
  ""dax"" is followed by green and then yellow, but since ""zup"" can also follow ""dax"" and yield blue in another case, ""zup"" may not be linked to yellow specifically.

- Input: dax bluf wif zup lug → Output: green green red yellow blue
  Here ""dax"" is again followed by two greens, with subsequent colors not showing a direct pattern in relation to ""dax.""

- The last example is the same as the third one, reinforcing the pattern that ""dax"" leads to a green and is followed by another green.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""dax"" indicates the start of a sequence of three greens in the output. Any following colors are determined by the words after ""dax"" and not ""dax"" itself.

Rule: dax -> Start of a sequence signifying three greens in the output.",-7.045702189277778,18,dax
"Based on the examples given, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" affects the color output associated with each subsequent word. Specifically, ""dax"" seems to initiate a sequence of color outputs where the following words dictate specific colors.

Let's analyze the examples to see if we can deduce the rule for ""dax"":

1. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   
   It starts with ""dax,"" followed by a repeated color ""green"" for ""walm,"" and then ""yellow"" for ""zup."" Following this, we see ""blue"" for ""lug,"" before another ""green"" for ""dax.""
   
2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   
   The word ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" which results in the color ""green"" being repeated.
   
3. Input: dax zup
   Output: green yellow
   
   The word ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and then ""zup"" changes the output to ""yellow.""
   
4. Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
   Output: green green red yellow blue
   
   Again, ""dax"" starts the sequence with ""green,"" then ""bluf"" results in another ""green,"" ""wif"" changes it to ""red,"" then ""yellow"" for ""zup,"" and finally ""blue"" for ""lug.""
   
5. Input: dax zup
   Output: green yellow
   
   As before, ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow.""

From these examples, we can infer a few rules:
- ""dax"" always leads to the output of ""green.""
- ""walm,"" given its repetition with ""green,"" seems to sustain the ""green"" color output.
- ""zup"" changes the output color to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" is associated with the output ""blue.""
- ""wif"" seems to be associated with the color ""red.""

Given this analysis, the rule appears to be that ""dax"" initiates a color sequence with ""green"" and might be considered a reset or start command for this series of color outputs. Here is the deduced rule:

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that follows its use. Here are the specific instances where ""bluf"" is used and what follows:

1. zup wif bluf zup lug -> yellow red red yellow blue (bluf is followed by red, translates to red)
2. zup bluf -> yellow yellow (bluf is the last word, so no color follows, but it translates to yellow which is the color corresponding to ""zup"")

In each case, ""bluf"" is immediately followed by a color. When ""bluf"" appears last, or is not followed by a named color, it defaults to the color of the preceding word.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to examine each example where this word occurs and look at the corresponding sequence of color outputs. 

From the examples given:

- In ""dax walm zup walm,"" ""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The word ""walm"" appears twice, and each time, it generates ""yellow yellow yellow."" 
- In ""lug dax zup dax walm wif,"" we see ""lug"" likely corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" After ""walm,"" one ""green"" is shown, followed by ""wif"" with a ""red"" output.
- In ""zup wif walm,"" ""zup"" produces ""yellow,"" ""wif"" produces ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" we see ""red red red.""
- In ""dax lug walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and after ""walm"" we have ""blue blue blue.""
- In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and again ""walm"" is followed by ""blue blue blue.""

Based on these examples, it appears that ""walm"" does not correspond to a specific color, but rather to a rule about repetition.

2. In ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif,"" ""lug"" translates to blue, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""wif"" to red. The ""walm"" here also appears to repeat the color preceding it, giving us ""blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red.""

3. In ""dax wif walm,"" the output ""green red red red"" again supports the notion that ""walm"" repeats the color before it, even if ""wif"" is in between ""dax"" and ""walm.""

4. In ""wif walm zup lug zup walm,"" we see red followed by three reds, then yellow, blue, yellow, and three more yellows, reinforcing the interpretation that ""walm"" repeats the color that comes before it.

5. In ""zup wif walm lug,"" the sequence is yellow red followed by three reds and then blue, consistent with the idea that ""walm"" repeats the previous color.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" can be formulated as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color immediately preceding ""walm"" three times.",-4.992130127776,19,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look more closely at the examples provided:

Input: dax walm wif dax
Output: green green green red green
Analysis: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" ""walm"" appears between two ""dax"" which are both ""green,"" yet the color before ""wif"" becomes ""red."" Notice the presence of ""walm"" before ""wif.""

Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
Analysis: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" with ""wif"" as ""red."" Wherever ""walm"" appears, the color that follows (except when it's ""wif"") seems to repeat three times (blue blue blue, yellow yellow yellow), but before ""wif"" there is no repetition.

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red
Analysis: Here ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" and the color ""red"" is repeated three times after ""wif.""

Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
Analysis: Again, ""walm"" is followed by a color word (""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"") and the ""yellow"" is repeated three times. Before ""wif,"" ""walm"" does not cause a repetition.

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue
Analysis: Same as before, ""walm"" repeats ""red"" before ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue"") but does not cause a repetition before ""wif.""

Rule: Based on these examples, ""walm"" indicates that the color word that follows should be repeated three times. However, this rule does not apply when the color word following ""walm"" is ""red"" corresponding to ""wif."" In summary:

walm -> Repeats the following color word three times except when the next word is ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red.""",-8.151380935459,19,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to identify patterns in the input-output examples provided. Let's examine the colors associated with ""walm"" in the outputs as well as what precedes and follows ""walm"" in the inputs.

Input: dax walm wif dax
Output: green green green red green
- Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" and in the output, we see a sequence of ""green red"" associated with it.

Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
- In this case, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""zup,"" resulting in ""blue yellow."" When ""walm"" comes before ""wif,"" it results in a sequence of ""yellow red.""

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red
- ""Walm"" is at the end after ""wif,"" and the output is a sequence of ""red.""

Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""zup,"" resulting in ""red yellow."" When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is an additional ""yellow.""

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue
- ""Walm"" is following ""wif"" again, leading to the output ""red red.""

Looking at the patterns, it seems that ""walm"" requires context to determine its color output. Specifically, it appears to change the color output of the word that comes immediately after it. Here are some consistent patterns:

1. When ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" the output is repeated ""red.""
2. When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""zup,"" there is an additional ""yellow"" output.
3. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" it results in another ""yellow.""
4. When ""walm"" stands alone (without a specific word after it), it takes the color of the word before ""walm.""

From these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" has an effect on the following word, transforming the color output into a specific sequence or adding more instances of certain colors. However, the exact rule for ""walm"" is not clear from the given examples, as there might be more context needed. With the provided data, a tentative rule for ""walm"" could be:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue"".
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow"".

"dax -> green. Rule: Whenever the word dax appears in the input, the color green is produced in the output at the corresponding position.",-6.358208062219999,20,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" we need to analyze the patterns in input/output pairs and identify the common thread. Looking at the examples:

1. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
2. dax zup walm wif -> green yellow yellow yellow red
3. dax walm wif dax -> green green green red green
4. wif zup bluf -> red yellow yellow
5. wif walm zup -> red red red yellow

A common pattern is that the output immediately following ""wif"" is always red. Also, notice that the color red is only present immediately after the word ""wif."" For instance:

- In example 1: ""wif"" is followed by ""red.""
- In example 2: When ""wif"" is at the end of the input, the last color in the output is ""red.""
- In example 3: ""wif"" is followed by ""red,"" even when it is in the middle of the input sequence.
- In examples 4 and 5: regardless of the position of ""wif,"" be it at the start or followed by other words, it is always followed by ""red.""

Based on this, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" appears to be that it corresponds to the output ""red"" for the next position in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red (the word following ""wif"" in the input always translates to ""red"" in the output).",-1.0703461626,20,wif
"Let's analyze the data to deduce the rule of ""wif"":

1. When ""wif"" appears at the beginning of a sequence, it outputs ""red"":
   - wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green

2. When ""wif"" appears at the end or in the middle of a sequence, it outputs ""red"":
   - dax zup walm wif -> green yellow yellow yellow red

"Observing the patterns in the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif.""

In every example where ""wif"" is present, the corresponding output color is ""red."" Additionally, ""wif"" does not seem to change the color of the following words, since each of those appears with various colors in the output depending on their position or relationship with other words. Hence, ""wif"" appears to have a consistent one-to-one mapping with the color red in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Therefore, based on the examples given, we can induce the following rule:

- ""zup dax zup wif"" corresponds to ""yellow green yellow red"" (zup corresponds to yellow).
- ""dax bluf zup"" corresponds to ""green green yellow"" (again, zup corresponds to yellow).
- ""lug zup"" corresponds to ""blue yellow"" (zup corresponds to yellow).
- ""zup lug"" corresponds to ""yellow blue"" (zup corresponds to yellow).
- ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow"" (each zup corresponds to yellow).

Therefore, the rule is consistent across all examples provided.

- For ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""
- ""bluf"" is paired with ""green,"" which is the same output as ""dax"" (suggesting that its color is not based on simply the input word itself but perhaps its position or another factor).
- ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that the output might not rely solely on the input word but could be tied to the number of letters, repeating letters, or some other characteristic specific to the word.

However, all inputs that contain ""zup"" consistently result in ""yellow,"" indicating a strong likelihood that ""zup"" translates directly to ""yellow,"" independent of the context in which it is used.

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the correspondence between the input phrases and their outputs.

1. From the first example:
- dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
- We can see that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

2. From the second example:
- dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> green blue yellow red red green
- We know ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""; ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and, by process of elimination, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

3. From the third example:
- zup bluf wif bluf -> yellow yellow red red
- Knowing that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and the pattern repeating, we can infer that ""bluf"" shares the color for the word preceding it.

4. From the fourth and fifth examples:
- ""bluf"" always takes the same color as the word before it appears, by looking at the output colors of the preceding words.

Rule:
bluf -> meaning. ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it.",-2.4378076505679998,20,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the color outputs associated with ""bluf"" in each example and compare them with the other words.

In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color yellow. The same is true for the second, third, and fifth examples. However, in the fourth example, ""bluf"" is associated with red.

Now let's analyze the position of ""bluf"" relative to other words:

1. ""dax bluf zup"" -> green yellow yellow
   Since ""dax"" is green in both the first and second positions, the output color doesn't seem to be position-dependent. ""zup"" is yellow in both the last and first positions, reinforcing that position may not determine color.

2. ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" -> green blue yellow red red green
   The second ""dax"" is still green, justifying that ""dax"" consistently leads to green. ""bluf"" is red here, breaking the initially observed pattern of ""bluf"" corresponding to yellow.

3. ""zup bluf wif bluf"" -> yellow yellow red red
   With ""bluf"" repeated here and both times corresponding to red, it seems the color may be dependent on the presence of other words, not just its position.

4. ""wif bluf dax lug"" -> red red green blue
   ""Bluf"" is red here, and the words before and after ""bluf"" appear to affect the color less, as ""dax"" after ""bluf"" is still green and ""wif"" before ""bluf"" is still red.

5. ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" -> yellow yellow red blue green
   The first ""bluf"" instance here is yellow again, which is not consistent with the red from the previous two examples.

Based on the input and output sequences, here is a possible rule for what ""bluf"" means:

The color output for ""bluf"" is context-sensitive:
- If ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it results in red.
- If ""bluf"" does not follow ""wif,"" it results in yellow.

Therefore, we can induce that the color output for ""bluf"" depends on the word immediately preceding it. If the preceding word is ""wif,"" the output is red; for any other word, the output is yellow.

Rule: bluf -> meaning
- Following ""wif"": red
- Otherwise: yellow",-2.7802002787960007,20,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we must examine the patterns between the input and the output in each example. 

Let's analyze each example's input and corresponding output closely:

1. Input: dax bluf zup
   Output: green green yellow

2. Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue yellow red red green

3. Input: zup bluf wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow red red

4. Input: wif bluf dax lug
   Output: red red green blue

5. Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
   Output: yellow yellow red blue green

Observations:
- Whenever the word ""bluf"" appears, the output is ""red.""
- ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""Wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and is followed by ""red"" as well. However, ""wif"" in the first position results in ""red,"" but this is not conclusive based on other examples.
- ""Lug,"" when it follows ""dax,"" results in ""blue,"" but when it follows ""wif,"" it is still ""blue.""

The pattern that emerges is that ""bluf"" consistently results in the color ""red"" in the output regardless of its position or neighboring words in the input. 

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> red.",-7.104903341475,20,bluf
"To deduce the rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine each example and the associated colors. Here are the instances of ""bluf"" and their corresponding colors from the input-output pairs:

1. bluf -> yellow
2. bluf -> red
3. bluf -> yellow, bluf -> red
4. bluf -> red
5. bluf -> yellow

Looking at the inputs, it seems that ""bluf"" does not have a consistent color output. However, we can see patterns in the other words:

- ""dax"" always corresponds to green.
- ""zup"" always corresponds to yellow.
- ""wif"" always corresponds to red.
- ""lug"" always corresponds to blue.

Since ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""lug"" have consistent colors, and ""bluf""'s color changes, it appears that ""bluf"" does not correspond to a specific color on its own. Instead, ""bluf"" might be acting as a modifier to the word following it.

By looking at the patterns, we see that ""bluf"" changes the output color for the word that comes right after it:

- In the first example, ""bluf zup"" results in ""green yellow"" instead of ""yellow yellow.""
- In the second example, ""bluf dax"" results in ""red green"" instead of ""green green.""
- In the third example, ""bluf wif"" results in ""red red,"" which is consistent with ""wif"" on its own, indicating that it may not impact ""wif.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf dax"" results in ""red green,"" which is similar to the second example.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf wif"" results in ""yellow red,"" but this inconsistency with example 3 suggests there might be another rule at play when multiple ""blufs"" are in the sequence.

Given the variations and that ""bluf"" does not seem to affect ""wif,"" it might be that ""bluf"" has a context-dependent meaning that affects certain words and not others. However, from the provided examples, the rule is not entirely clear. 

Based on the available data, the tentative rule for ""bluf"" in relation to green (dax) is:

Rule: When ""bluf"" is placed before ""dax,"" the output for ""bluf"" becomes red, and ""dax"" remains green. This doesn't consistently hold for ""wif,"" and the effect on ""lug"" and ""zup"" cannot be determined from the given examples as these combinations do not occur.

Given that ""zup"" proceeded by ""bluf"" resulted in yellow once and green another time, there isn't enough data to confidently determine the rule for ""bluf"" before ""zup."" Similarly, there's no instance of ""bluf"" coming before ""lug,"" so that rule remains undetermined.

In an attempt to summarize with the information at hand:

Rule: ""bluf"" might change the color associated with the word that follows it, potentially turning green into red when preceding ""dax,"" but this does not seem to affect ""wif"" and the rule for ""zup"" and ""lug"" is indeterminate without further examples.",-7.70493988154,20,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns of color outputs based on the given examples.

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""yellow."" 

2. In the second example, ""bluf"" is positioned after ""wif"" and before ""dax,"" and it corresponds to the output ""red."" 

3. In the third example, ""bluf"" appears twice, and both times it corresponds to ""red.""

4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" again and corresponds to ""red.""

5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and corresponds to ""yellow.""

From these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" does not have a consistent color output between ""green,"" ""blue,"" ""yellow,"" and ""red."" Instead, the output color associated with ""bluf"" seems to depend on its position related to other words. Notably, whenever ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the corresponding color is ""yellow,"" and when it follows ""wif,"" the corresponding color is ""red.""

Based on the given examples, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup"" and to ""red"" when it follows ""wif."" When analyzing the sequence ""dax bluf zup,"" despite the presence of ""zup"" after ""bluf,"" the rule that applies when ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" cannot be confirmed, and thus ""bluf"" in the first position defaults to being associated with ""yellow.""

Given the lack of examples where ""bluf"" follows different words, or examples illustrating what happens when ""dax"" or ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" we cannot confidently extend the rule beyond these two observed patterns. Therefore, we'll focus on the two reliable precedents:

bluf -> meaning: ""bluf"" means ""yellow"" after ""zup"" and ""red"" after ""wif.""",-9.178599917206,20,bluf
"To induce the rule for ""walm,"" let's first look at what changes between inputs and outputs in each example.

1. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red
2. dax walm zup -> green green green yellow
3. zup walm dax zup dax wif -> yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
4. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
5. wif lug zup walm wif lug -> red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue

Each time ""walm"" appears in the input, the output is a repetition of the color associated with the following word until a new word appears.

1. ""walm wif"" resulted in ""green red red"". ""wif"" is red, so after ""walm,"" red repeats.
2. ""walm zup"" resulted in ""green yellow"". ""zup"" is yellow, so after ""walm,"" yellow follows.
3. ""walm dax"" resulted in ""yellow green"". ""dax"" is green, so after ""walm,"" green follows.
4. After ""lug walm,"" blue is repeated.
5. After ""zup walm,"" there is a repetition of yellow, continuing until red appears for ""wif.""

From these patterns, we can conclude that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the following word to repeat until a new word with a different associated color appears. If there is no such word, it just continues the color pattern of the word that precedes it.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color of the following word to repeat until a different color-associated word is encountered.",-1.092370132774,20,walm
"From the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" acts as an instruction to repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. Here is how we can deduce this:

Example 1: ""dax walm wif bluf"" translates to ""green green green red red"". ""Dax"" is followed by ""walm"" and translates to ""green"", which is then repeated (""green green green""). ""Wif"" then translates to ""red"", followed by one additional ""red"" not explicitly paired with another word, likely as a standard translation.

Example 2: ""dax walm zup"" translates to ""green green green yellow"". ""Dax"" before ""walm"" again translates to repeated ""green"", while ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".

Example 3: ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red"". ""Zup"" before ""walm"" translates to repeated ""yellow"", then ""dax"" translates to ""green"", followed by a standalone ""yellow"", then another ""green"" from ""dax"", followed by a ""red"" for ""wif"".

Example 4: ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" Here, ""dax"" translates to ""green"" but does not repeat, suggesting that ""walm"" only applies to the word immediately preceding it. ""Lug"" then translates to ""blue"", which is repeated due to ""walm"".

Example 5: ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" translates to ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue"". ""Wif"" translates to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""zup"" before ""walm"" translates to repeated ""yellow"". After ""walm"", ""wif"" translates to ""red"", followed by ""blue"" for ""lug"".

Based on this analysis, the rule for walm appears to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" is encountered, it causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated once. If ""walm"" is at the end of a sequence or followed by a different word, it does not trigger another repetition beyond the first associated with it.

Walm -> causes the preceding word's associated color to be repeated once.",-1.112173743506,20,walm
"Considering the given examples and analyzing the outputs associated with the input that includes the nonce word ""walm,"" we can attempt to deduce the rule that the word ""walm"" dictates. For each instance of ""walm"" in the input, we will look for patterns in the color sequence of the output.

1. Input: dax walm wif bluf | Output: green green green red red
2. Input: dax walm zup | Output: green green green yellow
3. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif | Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
4. Input: dax lug walm | Output: green blue blue blue
5. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug | Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue

Based on the given examples, the patterns that emerge immediately after the word ""walm"" are as follows:

- In example 1, we have ""walm wif bluf"" corresponding to ""green red red"". Notice that ""green"" comes before ""walm"", so the first ""green"" in the sequence might not be caused by ""walm"".
- In example 2, ""walm zup"" matches ""green yellow"". Again, the ""green"" precedes ""walm"".
- In example 3, ""walm"" is sandwiched between ""zup"" and ""dax""; hence ""zup walm dax"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow green"".
- In example 4, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"".
- In example 5, ""walm wif lug"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red blue"".

Upon careful examination of the examples given, it seems that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. For instance, whenever ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", the color ""green"" is repeated twice immediately after. When ""zup"" precedes ""walm"", ""yellow"" is repeated twice. When ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated thrice. Following this pattern, ""walm"" appears to induce a repetition effect.

To summarize this deduced rule formally:

walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated.

This leads to a dependent rule where the meaning of ""walm"" hinges on the color association of the word that comes just before it. Hence, if a word corresponding to ""red"" appeared before ""walm,"" we would expect ""red"" to be repeated in the pattern that follows.",-7.905068212170001,20,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of ""walm"" by comparing the inputs with their respective outputs and looking for patterns: 

1. In every instance of ""walm,"" the color that follows is the one that corresponds to the word that precedes ""walm."" Let's map this out:

- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green.""
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow.""
- ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" leads to ""yellow yellow red blue,"" which again repeats the pattern of the previous word being ""zup.""

2. However, in the third example ""zup walm dax zup dax wif,"" the occurrence of ""walm"" produces three ""yellow"" in the output, corresponding to ""zup,"" which precedes ""walm."" It doesn't follow it, and ""dax"" produces a ""green"" afterward.

3. The first and last examples (""dax walm wif bluf"" and ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"") contain series of colors as outputs where we see repetition of colors from previous words multiple times after ""walm,"" although ""bluf"" does not have a direct correlation.

From these observations, the pattern suggests that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the word before it, extending beyond just the immediate next output. This repetition continues until a new color is introduced by another word:

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" until a different color word is encountered.",-8.64237084476,20,walm
"The nonce word ""walm"" seems to influence the output colors in a pattern that depends on the word(s) that come before it. In order to determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the examples provided and the respective outputs.

- In the first example, the output following ""walm"" is three occurrences of green and two occurrences of red.
- In the second example, the output following ""walm"" is one occurrence of yellow.
- In the third example, the output following ""walm"" has three occurrences of yellow and one of green.
- In the fourth example, the output following ""walm"" is three occurrences of blue.
- In the fifth example, the output following ""walm"" starts with two occurrences of yellow, followed by red and blue.

Let's attempt to deduce the rule by examining the position of ""walm"" and the words that precede it:

1. ""dax walm"" precedes three greens regardless of what follows.
2. ""lug walm"" leads to three blues following it.
3. ""zup walm"" precedes a string of yellows, and the number seems to depend on the number of ""zup"" words before ""walm"": one ""zup"" leads to one yellow; two ""zups"" lead to three yellows.
4. The presence of ""wif"" after ""walm"" leads to red but the amount of red depends on the example and it shows up in examples 1, 3, and 5.

From this analysis, it seems that ""walm"" triggers a sequence of colors that are determined by the word that immediately precedes it. Specifically, the word before ""walm"" affects the amount and type of colors outputted after ""walm.""

- ""dax walm"" → three greens
- ""lug walm"" → three blues
- ""zup walm"" → a number of yellows that might be related to the number of ""zups"" before ""walm""
- ""wif walm"" appears in different contexts and does not have a consistent output; hence, we cannot define its rule based on the provided examples.

Therefore, based on the examples given, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be tied to the word that comes immediately before it, determining the number and color of the outputs that follow it, although the rule for ""wif walm"" is not clear from the given data.

"Given the examples, we can determine a pattern correlating the nonce word ""bluf"" to a particular color in the output. Here’s the analysis:

1. ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green."" Since ""wif"" is repeated and results in a repeated ""red,"" ""bluf"" likely corresponds to ""red,"" not ""green,"" as ""dax"" is different and results in ""green,"" and ""bluf"" repeats ""red.""
2. ""dax zup lug bluf"" leads to ""green yellow blue blue."" The new occurrence of ""bluf"" results in a ""blue,"" but there is another ""blue"" in the output for ""lug,"" and ""dax"" gives ""green"" which does not align with the first example. 
3. ""dax bluf wif lug"" becomes ""green green red blue."" ""bluf"" here corresponds to ""green,"" which supports it being ""red"" from the first example if we consider that ""dax"" is before ""bluf"" and may affect its color representation.
4. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" results in ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" The appearance of ""bluf"" at the end of the sequence correlates with a ""red,"" aligning with the first example.
5. ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red,"" which directly supports ""bluf"" corresponding to ""red.""

Taking all examples into account, with particular attention to the first and last examples where ""bluf"" is directly associated with ""red,"" it seems that the most consistent rule is that ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> red",-0.855663162954,21,bluf

3. dax bluf wif lug -> green green red blue
4. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
5. wif bluf -> red red

From these examples, we can notice a pattern where ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" in the output. Another consistent rule is that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to represent the color ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> red.",-0.91536532982,21,bluf
"Observing the examples given, we attempt to determine the pattern that leads to the transformation from the input to the output.

1. Input: wif bluf dax -> Output: red red green
2. Input: dax zup lug bluf -> Output: green yellow blue blue
3. Input: dax bluf wif lug -> Output: green green red blue
4. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
5. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red

From the examples, it seems that the output color does not directly depend on the position of ""bluf"" in the series of words, but rather on a property of the word following ""bluf"". To determine the rule, we should consider what the input words have in common with their corresponding outputs when ""bluf"" is present:

- In Examples 1 and 5, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" and the output is ""red green"" and ""red"" respectively. This seems like a potential contradiction, but we can account for the fact that the output pattern might be dependent on the sequence, not just individual words.
- In Example 2, ""bluf"" is followed by no words, and the output after ""blue"" is also absent.
- In Example 3, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" and the output is ""green red"".
- In Example 4, ""bluf"" follows every color from the output pattern up till ""red red"".

Given this information, we could conjecture that ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color of the word immediately following it (if there is one). When ""bluf"" is the last word and there is no word after it to take a color from, there is no color in the output (seen in Example 2).

However, Example 4 contradicts this as ""bluf"" should repeat ""green"" from ""wif"" but instead, it repeats ""green red"" which suggests that ""bluf"" might cause the output to repeat the last two colors. Given the inconsistency, we might need an additional rule or a different interpretation.

Upon closer inspection, it is observed that ""bluf"" seems to cause a repetition of the output color of the word that precedes ""bluf"" itself:

- In Example 1, the word before ""bluf"" is ""wif"" which outputs ""red"", and after ""bluf"" is ""red green"", ""green"" being for ""dax"".
- In Example 3, the word before ""bluf"" is ""dax"" which outputs ""green"", and after ""bluf"" is ""green red"".
- In Example 4, ""bluf"" repeats the colors for ""wif lug"" which are ""green red"".

With this pattern, we can conclude:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> The meaning of bluf is to repeat the output color of the word immediately before it. If there is no previous word, there would be no color to repeat (though this cannot be confirmed with the given examples).",-6.367494787083001,21,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we must analyze patterns and corresponding outputs in each example given. The word ""bluf"" appears in every input, and we can try to pinpoint what ""bluf"" translates to in each output.

1. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green
   - ""bluf"" correlates to the second ""red.""

2. Input: dax zup lug bluf
   Output: green yellow blue blue
   - ""bluf"" correlates to the second ""blue.""

3. Input: dax bluf wif lug
   Output: green green red blue
   - ""bluf"" correlates to the second ""green.""

4. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   - ""bluf"" correlates to the second ""red.""

5. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   - ""bluf"" correlates to the second ""red.""

From these examples, ""bluf"" consistently correlates to a color that is repeated from the previous word's color in the output. More precisely, the word ""bluf"" causes the color of the output tied to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" to repeat.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> meaning. ""Bluf"" causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to be repeated in the output.

Hence, bluf -> causes the color of the precedingly associated word to be repeated.",-6.653203693415999,21,bluf
"Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red."" When ""bluf"" appears in the input, the output is consistently ""red.""

bluf -> red.",-10.25976651882,21,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let’s analyze the provided examples:

1. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
2. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
3. ""zup lug walm wif walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""
4. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" -> ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""

Looking at these examples, we can observe the following patterns:

- Each instance of ""walm"" in the output leads to a thrice-repeated color.
- The color that is repeated corresponds to a color mentioned before ""walm,"" but not directly before it.
- In examples 1, 3, and 5, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" ""wif,"" and ""lug,"" respectively, and it results in ""red red red,"" ""red red red,"" and ""blue blue blue,"" respectively. Therefore, it seems that the color that is tripled is the one associated with the word that appears first in the input sequence before ""walm.""
- In example 4, ""lug wif dax zup walm"" translates to ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow,"" here the tripled color is ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup,"" and not to the colors directly preceding ""walm"" (""green"" for ""dax"" or ""blue"" for ""lug""). Once again, it seems to affirm that the word ""zup,"" which appears first in the sequence before ""walm,"" is the one that dictates the color to be tripled.
- In example 2, ""dax lug walm"" outputs ""green blue blue blue."" Here, ""green"" corresponds to ""dax,"" and once again, it is not the immediately preceding word (""lug"") but an earlier one.
- Note that ""lug"" always translates to ""blue,"" but when ""walm"" follows it, the output is ""blue blue blue,"" indicating ""walm"" indeed triples the applicable color.

Based on these observations, the rule potentially in place for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" takes the color associated with the first word preceding it in the input and repeats that color three times in the output.

Following this rule:

walm -> takes the color of the first preceding word and repeats it thrice.",-1.136099070692,21,walm
"From the given examples, we can infer the following patterns concerning the word ""walm"":

1. ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red"".
2. ""dax lug walm"" corresponds to ""green blue blue blue"".
3. ""zup lug walm wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue blue red red red"".
4. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" corresponds to ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow"".
5. ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue"".

Looking at these, we can notice that:

- ""walm"" when following ""wif"" results in a triple repetition of the color corresponding to ""wif"" (red).
- ""walm"" when following ""lug"" results in a triple repetition of the color corresponding to ""lug"" (blue).
- ""walm"" when following ""dax lug"" results in a repetition of the color corresponding to ""lug"" (blue) three times. It doesn't seem to be affected by ""dax"" (green) directly.
- ""walm"" when follows ""zup lug"" results in a repetition of the color corresponding to ""lug"" (blue) three times, with ""zup"" yielding its color once.
- ""walm"" on its own after ""lug"" also results in a triple repetition of the color corresponding to ""lug"".

Based on this pattern, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the last mentioned color three times. The color repeated is the one directly associated with the word that comes immediately before ""walm"".

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding “walm” three times.",-1.3136372253480002,21,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at each input and corresponding output, considering the sequence and repetition of the colors in the output.

- Input: wif walm -> Output: red red red
- Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue
- Input: zup lug walm wif walm -> Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
- Input: lug wif dax zup walm -> Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
- Input: lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue

From these examples, we can attempt to identify patterns and rules:

1. In every output, the color that corresponds to ""walm"" is repeated three times. Hence, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word preceding it three times.

2. This repetition rule for ""walm"" holds regardless of the color it repeats (i.e., ""walm"" repeats red, blue, and yellow).

3. ""walm"" itself does not correspond to a new color but is dependent on the preceding word.

- Example 3: ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", followed by ""bluf"", which gives us another ""blue"" since it follows a ""blue"", and finally ""zup"" is ""yellow"". So the output is ""blue blue yellow"".
- Example 4: ""wif"" translates to ""red"", ""walm"" (which we can infer is also ""red"" given that ""walm"" is not explicitly translated in other examples and that the given output contains two consecutive ""red"" colors before ""blue""), ""lug"" which is ""blue"", and ""bluf"" which adds an additional ""blue"".

- Example 5: ""wif"" is ""red"", followed by ""bluf"", which gives us an additional ""red"" because it comes after ""wif"". So the result is ""red red"".

   Rule: ""walm"" causes ""green"" to repeat twice, and ""zup"" and ""lug"" translate to ""yellow"" and ""blue,"" respectively, followed by another ""dax"" which is ""green.""

From these examples, we can deduce that the rule for ""walm"" involves repeating the color of the preceding word three times in total (original plus two repeats). Therefore:

walm -> Causes the color of the word before it to be repeated two more times, making three instances of that color in a row.",-0.730350287676,22,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" results in a sequence of the word ""green"" being outputted three times in a row. To confirm this, we can evaluate the usage of ""walm"" in different contexts:

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - Here, ""walm"" directly follows ""dax"" and results in ""green green green.""

2. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   - ""Wif"" seems to be associated with a single ""red,"" and since ""walm"" follows it and results in ""red red red,"" ""wif"" likely has no bearing on what ""walm"" means.

3. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   - In this sequence, ""walm"" is used twice and both times it corresponds to ""green green green"" for the first instance and ""red red red"" for the second. This suggests ""wif"" could mean a change in the color sequence.

4. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   - Like the previous example, ""walm"" consistently results in a threefold repetition of a color.

5. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   - ""Walm"" again results in ""green green green,"" whereas ""zup"" and ""lug"" seem to correspond with ""yellow"" and ""blue,"" respectively.

Given the consistency in the outputs following ""walm,"" it appears that ""walm"" corresponds with the rule of outputting the color ""green"" three times.

Rule: walm -> green green green",-4.972663651497999,22,walm

Rule: The presence of the nonce word ""walm"" in the input results in the word ""green"" in the output every time it appears.",-9.29133121856,22,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in each example and their corresponding outputs.

- Input: dax walm
  Output: green green green
  Since ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and both generate ""green green green,"" the presence of ""walm"" does not appear to change the output compared to just ""dax.""

- Input: dax wif walm
  Output: green red red red
  The new element here is ""wif,"" and its presence appears to change the output significantly. However, because ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red red,"" it seems that ""walm"" alone does not directly correspond to ""red red red."" Instead, ""wif"" is more likely the trigger for the ""red"" outputs.

- Input: dax walm wif walm zup
  Output: green green green red red red yellow
  Compared to the previous input, ""wif"" had the same effect, changing the output that follows it to ""red,"" and the ""zup"" at the end corresponds to ""yellow."" The presence of ""walm"" after ""wif"" does not change the output from ""red"" as induced after ""wif"" in the previous example. So, ""walm"" following a ""wif"" maintains the ""red"" output it induced.

- Input: dax walm wif walm
  Output: green green green red red red
  This input features ""walm"" twice again but without ""zup."" The output pattern repeats from ""dax"" to the first ""walm"" as ""green green green,"" and the ""walm"" after ""wif"" does not change the output from ""red.""

- Input: dax walm zup lug dax
  Output: green green green yellow blue green
  Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and the final ""dax"" to ""green."" Notice that the presence of ""walm"" at the beginning of the series did not change the subsequent colors associated with each nonce word.

Based on these observations, it appears that the word ""walm"" does not alter the pattern of colors in a meaningful way. The outputs from ""dax walm"" and ""dax"" alone both start with ""green green green,"" implying that ""walm"" by itself does not warrant changing the color output when following ""dax."" Therefore, it's safe to conclude that ""walm"" either repeats the output color preceding it or has no effect on altering the color output in these examples.

Rule: walm -> repeats the previous color output or has no effect.",-10.624305374429003,22,walm

"Based on the given examples, the rule for the meaning of the word ""lug"" is quite straightforward:

Rule: lug -> blue,-10.214317129146,23,lug
Rule: lug -> blue,-10.214317129146,23,lug
"Based on the examples given, we can induce the following pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"":

In every instance, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" However, ""dax"" does not only define the color green, it also seems to affect the preceding words, changing their associated colors too. Whenever ""dax"" appears, the words before ""dax"" change their output to match the color of the first word before ""dax"". This pattern is consistent across all examples provided.

Here's the breakdown:

1. In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""dax"" appears, ""zup"" and ""wif"" both turn to ""green"" matching the color of ""zup,"" which is the first word in the sequence before ""dax.""

2. In the second example, only ""dax"" is present, so the output is simply ""green.""

3. In the third example, ""wif"" and ""walm"" both turn ""red,"" matching ""wif,"" the first word, after ""dax"" is introduced.

4. In the fourth example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""dax"" appears, ""walm"" also turns ""blue,"" matching ""lug,"" the first word.

5. In the fifth example, ""dax"" follows ""walm,"" and the entire output turns ""green,"" showing that ""dax"" can affect even words following it to adopt the same color, though in this case, there is no way to confirm if it's due to ""dax"" affecting ""walm"" or if ""walm"" inherently corresponds to ""green"" when preceded by ""dax.""

In summary, ""dax"" changes the color output of words before it to green, and it seems to change any surrounding words to match the color of the first word preceding ""dax."" 

Hence, the rule for ""dax"" can be formulated as:

Rule: dax -> turns the color of all preceding (and possibly following) words to match the color of the first word before it while its own color output is green.",-7.25364996552,23,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can induce the following pattern:

1. When the word ""dax"" appears after another word, the color associated with ""dax"" is green.
2. However, if ""dax"" appears alone, it is also green.
3. Without the presence of ""dax,"" the other words (""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""walm,"" ""lug"") seem to have their own associated colors regardless of their order.

To summarize:
- ""dax"" changes the output to green for itself and all words following it until a different color is specified by another word.

Thus, we can deduce:

dax -> When ""dax"" appears, it and any subsequent words not interrupted by a word with a different associated color are identified as green.

Rule: If ""dax"" is present, output green for ""dax"" and continue to output green until a different word with its own color association appears.",-7.937768645919999,23,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green."" Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output at the respective position. Additionally, there seems to be a pattern that the appearance of ""dax"" might change the color of the subsequent words. However, this pattern is inconsistent across different examples, so we will focus on the direct word-to-output correspondence.

Rule: dax -> green",-8.60478782256,23,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze its context in each example:

1. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif

2. Input: dax
   Output: green
   
3. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   
4. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   
5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

Analyzing the examples:

- In the first example, every time ""dax"" appears, the corresponding output is ""green.""
- In the second example where the only input is ""dax,"" the output remains ""green.""
- In the third example, immediately following ""dax,"" the output is again ""green.""
- In the fourth and fifth examples, the trend continues with the appearance of ""dax"" aligning with an output of ""green.""

Based on this, we can infer a rule:

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.

Therefore, dax -> green.",-8.709340213646001,23,dax
"To determine the meaning or rule behind the word ""dax,"" let's look at the patterns in the given examples where ""dax"" has been used.

1. When ""dax"" appears after ""walm,"" the output is always green.
2. When ""dax"" appears alone, the output is green.
3. When ""dax"" appears after ""zup,"" the output is green.

Based on these observations, it seems that whenever ""dax"" appears in an input, the corresponding output is always green.

Additionally, ""dax"" seems to turn all outputs following it to green until a different specific word appears that changes the output color (e.g., ""wif"" changes it to red).

Considering the above points, the inferred rule for the nonce word ""dax"" is as follows:

Rule: When the word ""dax"" appears in an input sequence, it changes the output to green for itself and any subsequent words until a new word with a specific color output is encountered.",-8.91254356634,23,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" we should look at its occurrence in various examples and the corresponding output. Let's analyze each example one by one:

1. ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red"". The word ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" which subsequently translates to ""red red"".

2. ""wif dax wif lug wif"" translates to ""red green red blue red"". Here, ""wif"" appears thrice and the colors are ""red green"", ""red blue"", and ""red"" respectively. 

3. ""dax lug wif"" translates to ""green blue red"". In this example, the word ""wif"" is at the end and translates to ""red"".

4. ""zup bluf wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red"". ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" here, and results in ""red"".

5. ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow"". ""wif"" appears at the beginning this time and translates to ""red"".

From each of these examples, we can observe that irrespective of its position in the sentence or the words following or preceding it, ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"". Therefore, we can conclude the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red.",-0.9266051278780001,23,wif
"Based on the examples given, we can see a consistent pattern where the nonce word ""wif"" is associated with the color red in the output. Each instance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence. Other words like ""zup,"" ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""walm,"" and ""bluf"" are consistently associated with other colors (""yellow,"" ""green,"" ""blue,"" etc.).

Therefore, the rule we can deduce from the examples provided is as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",-6.924527628460001,23,wif
"Based on the examples given, we can determine that each word (zup, wif, walm, dax, lug, bluf) corresponds to a color. To figure out what ""wif"" means, let's look at the patterns in which it appears and the output colors:

- In the first example, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"", and the output is ""red red red red"". Since ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red"", we can deduce that ""walm"" is ""red"" on its own, but we can't be sure about ""wif"" yet.
  
- In the second example, ""wif"" appears three times, producing ""red"" each time, regardless of whether it is followed by ""dax"" (green), ""lug"" (blue), or at the end of the input. This suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".

- The third example has ""wif"" appearing once, following ""dax"" and ""lug"", and the corresponding output is ""red"" for ""wif"".

- In the fourth example, ""wif"" appears between two ""bluf"", and it translates to ""red"", just like in the previous examples.

- The last example puts ""wif"" at the beginning followed by ""walm"", and again we see ""red"" corresponding to ""wif"".

Through consistent analysis, we can determine:

Rule: wif -> red",-7.232255971570001,23,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Each instance of the word ""wif"" in the input sequences consistently results in ""red"" in the output sequences, regardless of the position of ""wif"" or the other words around it.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's look at the consistent pattern in the examples provided:

1. Whenever the input begins with ""zup"" followed by another word, the output starts with ""yellow.""
   - ""zup dax"" -> ""yellow green""
   - ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
   - ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" -> ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue""

2. When ""zup"" follows a word, it translates to ""yellow"" in the second position of the output.
   - ""dax zup"" -> ""green yellow""
   - ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" -> ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue""

3. When ""zup"" is repeated, as seen in the last example, the output is ""yellow"" followed by another ""yellow.""
   - ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""

Considering the consistent appearance of ""yellow"" in the output wherever ""zup"" appears in the input and irrespective of the words that follow or precede it, we can infer that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",-1.3383709032559998,23,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Here's the reasoning: In all instances where ""zup"" appears, the output includes the color ""yellow."" It appears consistently at the beginning of the output when ""zup"" is the first word in the input, and it appears correspondingly in the output when ""zup"" is elsewhere in the input.

- Input: dax zup -> Output: green yellow (zup corresponds to yellow, after green which corresponds to dax)
- Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue (first zup corresponds to the first yellow and second zup corresponds to the fifth word in the output, which is yellow)

Rule: zup -> yellow",-7.851461338479998,23,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the word ""zup"" is consistently associated with the color ""yellow"". Whether it precedes or follows another color-word (like ""dax"" or ""bluf""), the output for ""zup"" remains ""yellow"".

Now let's analyze the inputs and outputs in detail:

1. Input: zup dax / Output: yellow green
   Here, ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"", and ""dax"" is inferred to correlate with ""green"".

2. Input: zup bluf / Output: yellow yellow
   ""zup"" still correlates with ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" now also correlates with ""yellow"".

3. Input: dax zup / Output: green yellow
   This reconfirms that ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".

4. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug 
   Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
   ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and this is consistent for both appearances in the input.
   ""dax"" once again corresponds to ""green"".
   ""bluf"" is confirmed as ""yellow"" as well.
   ""wif"" seems to stand for ""red"", as it is the only new word and corresponds to the only new color in the output.
   ""lug"" is inferred to mean ""blue"".

5. Input: zup bluf / Output: yellow yellow
   This confirms previous findings that ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" as well.

Based on these observations, we have a clear rule for the meaning of ""zup"":

Rule: ""zup"" -> yellow",-7.877067104935999,23,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the patterns between the inputs and outputs. Let's list the input-output pairs for each given example:

1. dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow
2. dax lug wif bluf -> green blue red red
3. lug wif bluf dax lug bluf -> blue red red green blue blue
4. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
5. wif bluf -> red red

Looking at the patterns, it seems that ""bluf"" might correspond to the color produced by the word that immediately precedes it. Let's examine:

1. ""dax"" corresponds to green, both when it appears before and after ""bluf"".
2. ""wif"" corresponds to red, both when it appears before and after ""bluf"".
3. In the third example, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" twice, and both times the output is blue.
4. ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" in one instance and the output is yellow.
5. In the fifth example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output is red.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" results in the same color as the word preceding it. Hence, the word ""bluf"" represents a mimic or echo of the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: bluf -> the color corresponding to the preceding word.",-1.02628726472,23,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we must examine the outputs associated with its appearance:

1. dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow
2. dax lug wif bluf -> green blue red red
3. lug wif bluf dax lug bluf -> blue red red green blue blue
4. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
5. wif bluf -> red red

Considering the outputs that correspond to when ""bluf"" appears:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" or ""wif,"" it matches the color of the word before it (Example 1: green; Example 3: red).
- When ""bluf"" precedes ""dax"" or follows ""lug,"" the output is blue (Examples 2 and 3: blue; Example 4: yellow).
- When ""bluf"" stands alone with ""wif,"" it is red, which aligns with following ""wif"" (Example 5).

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word unless it is preceded by ""lug,"" in which case the output is blue. If it comes before ""dax"" without any preceding word, ""bluf"" is yellow.

Rule: bluf -> The color of ""bluf"" is the same as the preceding word unless the preceding word is ""lug"" (then it is blue); if it precedes ""dax"" with no word before it, it is yellow.  If it stands alone with ""wif"" it is red.",-1.0825503964199998,23,bluf

In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (green) and the output is another ""green."" This suggests that ""bluf"" might be a repeater of the previous color.

In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red) and the output is ""red."" This reinforces the idea that ""bluf"" repeats the color stated before it.

In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red) and ""lug"" (blue), producing ""red"" and ""blue"" respectively, consistent with our current hypothesis.

In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and the output is ""yellow,"" again supporting the repeater hypothesis.

From these examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to correspond to a color. We can observe that every time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output color matches the color of the word that preceded ""bluf"" in the output sequence:

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and so does ""bluf"" that follows.
- In the second example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""bluf"" takes the same color.
- In the third example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""blue"" when it follows ""lug"".
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and so does ""bluf"" that follows.

From the first input, we see that ""walm"" and ""wif"" are repeated, correlating with multiple repetitions of ""blue"" and ""red"" respectively. In the second input, ""bluf"" is correlated with two ""blue"" outputs, but ""dax"" is followed by two ""green"" outputs, indicating that ""bluf"" may correspond to blue, and ""dax"" may correspond to green.

From the third input, we observe that ""lug"" appears twice and each time it correlates with the color ""blue"" being in the output. We can deduce that regardless of its position in the input sequence, ""lug"" relates to the color ""blue"" in some manner.

In the fifth sequence, ""lug"" appears after three colors have been established (green, red, red), and it is followed by ""blue"". This continues to support the hypothesis that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

Rule:
lug -> blue",-3.1157189075239993,24,lug
"Based on the provided examples, we can analyze the occurrences of ""lug"" and what it results in within the outputs.

Input: lug walm wif bluf
Output: blue blue blue red red
- ""lug"" appears first and is followed by two instances of ""walm"" and ""wif,"" resulting in three blue outputs before the pattern changes with ""bluf"" leading to two red outputs.

Input: lug bluf dax bluf
Output: blue blue green green
- ""lug"" is followed by ""bluf"" then ""dax"" and ""bluf"" again, resulting in two blue outputs and two green outputs.

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
- ""wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""bluf"" precede the first ""lug,"" after which we see ""walm"" and ""dax"" followed by another ""lug"" with the corresponding outputs of blue, blue, green, and blue. 

Input: dax lug
Output: green blue
- ""dax"" precedes ""lug"" and results in green followed by blue.

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
- Before ""lug,"" there are three different words that each lead to a distinct color. Then, ""lug"" produces blue, and afterwards, ""zup"" leads to repeated yellows.

From these examples, we can deduce that ""lug"" changes the pattern of color output. Before a ""lug"" appears, there is a certain color sequence dictated by the words that precede it. Once ""lug"" appears, the color pattern changes, most prominently to blue.

Additionally, the word following ""lug"" seems to set the new color pattern:

- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is blue (""lug walm"" -> blue).
- When ""dax"" follows ""lug,"" the output is blue and the next output is changed by the word following ""dax"" (""lug"" -> blue, ""dax"" -> green).
- After a sequence of colors is presented and ""lug"" appears, it resets to blue, as seen in all of the provided examples.

It is not perfectly clear how ""lug"" affects the sequence since after ""lug,"" the colors do not always follow the previous patterns of non-lug sequences. However, a consistent observation is the presence of blue immediately after ""lug.""

- In the second input, ""wif"" alone results in ""red,"" which directly associates 'wif' with the color 'red'.

"Analyzing the provided examples, a pattern wherein each word corresponds with a color is observable. We can associate the following words with their respective colors based on consistency across the examples:

- ""dax"" invariably corresponds with ""green.""
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds with ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" is always associated with ""red.""
- ""lug"" matches with ""blue"" where it appears.
- ""walm"" matches with ""red"" in the provided examples, but since the word occurs with red multiples times in one of the examples, it suggests that ""walm"" might denote a repetition of the preceding color.

To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can observe the color that follows it in each example. We see that in every example, ""bluf"" is followed by the color ""red."" Moreover, ""bluf"" appears to stand alone without directly indicating repetition itself, unlike ""walm,"" which seems to indicate repetition based on the number of times ""red"" follows ""walm"" in a sequence.

However, the output ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"" for the input ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" seems to break this pattern, because we might expect to see ""red"" after ""bluf"" based on the initial assumption. Yet, we see ""blue,"" which corresponds to ""lug,"" not ""red."" This suggests that ""bluf"" does not directly translate to ""red"" but rather that its meaning is context-dependent.

Given that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" every time it appears, and noting that ""bluf"" does not always translate directly to ""red,"" we could hypothesize that ""bluf"" might indicate the duplication of the color that ""lug"" corresponds with, which is ""blue."" This hypothesis is supported by the fact that ""bluf"" precedes ""blue"" in the first and last examples. So when ""bluf"" is used, it results in the duplication of ""blue"" somewhere after it in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule as seen in the examples suggests:

bluf -> meaning. Rule: ""bluf"" indicates that ""blue"" will appear in the sequence following ""bluf.""

This tentative rule is derived from the information available, but additional context or examples may provide further clarity or necessitate adjustment of the rule.",-4.49050029502,24,bluf
"Analyzing the examples given, we can infer the following correspondences:

- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
- ""walm"" adds another instance of the last color mentioned.

Now, let's examine the outputs where ""bluf"" appears:

1. bluf follows ""lug zup"" (blue yellow) and results in the output ""blue yellow yellow"", which suggests that ""bluf"" might be taking the color before it or combining the existing sequence of colors.

2. bluf follows ""zup"" (yellow) and leads to an output of ""yellow yellow"", which implies that ""bluf"" might be duplicating the color before it.

3. bluf follows ""wif"" (red) and the output is ""red red"", reinforcing the idea that ""bluf"" duplicates the preceding color.

4. bluf follows ""wif"" again, and the pattern holds with ""red red"".

5. bluf follows ""zup"" (yellow) and before ""lug zup"" (blue yellow), with the output showing an additional ""yellow,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" again might be duplicating the previous color.

Based on these examples, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" duplicates the color immediately before it in the sequence.

Thus, the meaning attributed to the nonce word ""bluf"" would be:

bluf -> duplicates the previous color.",-4.90559638498,24,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following pattern in relation to the nonce word ""bluf"":

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" However, ""bluf"" on its own corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" precedes ""wif walm,"" which corresponds to ""red red red."" Once again, the presence of ""bluf"" by itself results in ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is again associated with the color ""red"" when followed by ""dax walm,"" which matches ""green green green.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" followed by ""dax"" gives us ""red red green,"" where ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" followed by ""lug zup walm"" corresponds to ""blue yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""bluf"" seems to correspond to ""blue"" again.

From these examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: When ""bluf"" appears alone or at the beginning of a sequence, it corresponds to ""blue."" When it is followed by another unique word, it seems to take on the color of the word that follows it.

Given this pattern, we can define ""bluf"" as follows:

bluf -> blue when standalone or at the start. Takes on the next color mentioned when not standalone.",-5.267682270248001,24,bluf
"Based on the input-output pairs provided, we can deduce the following:

In each sequence, every word seems to correspond to a specific color. These mappings can be inferred as follows:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""walm"" has also output ""red,"" indicating it may carry the same color meaning as ""wif"" or triggers a repetition of the last color mentioned before it.

Looking at the place of ""bluf"" in the sequences, it is followed by matching colors in the output. We can induce that ""bluf"" is likely a command for repeating the last color mentioned before it in the sequence, with the exception of its first occurrence (since there is no prior color for reference). In the first example, there is no color before ""bluf"" to repeat, so it could be assumed that ""bluf"" is assigned to ""blue"" as its initial value.

However, if we further analyze all the examples including the first one, we notice that after ""bluf"" is mentioned, the next word consistently translates to ""red"" in the output, except in the first input where there is no word after ""bluf"" (suggesting it might default to its own color, blue, in such instances). This establishes the pattern that ""bluf"" causes the next color to be ""red"" unless it's the last word in the sequence, in which case ""bluf"" is ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule is:
bluf -> When followed by another word, it changes the color corresponding to the next word to red. When it is the last word in the sequence, it corresponds to the color blue.",-8.09086149994,24,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word bluf seems to correspond to the color blue. In each instance of the input, the output directly after the word ""bluf"" is ""blue."" Moreover, the fact that the other words correspond to the colors yellow, red, and green consistently across the examples strengthens the conclusion that ""bluf"" represents ""blue."" Therefore, the rule can be written as:

Rule: bluf -> blue",-9.81597459789,24,bluf
"From the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" signals a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. In each example, the output color pattern includes a series of the same color following the occurrence of ""walm."" Here's how it applies to each input:

1. Input: ""wif walm lug bluf"" translates to ""red red red blue blue"". Here, ""wif"" must mean red, and the following ""walm"" means repeat the red before moving on to ""lug"" which means blue.
   
2. Input: ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"". ""lug"" signifies blue, and ""walm"" means repeat the blue.

3. Input: ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"". ""dax"" is green, and ""walm"" indicates the repetition of green.

4. Input: ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue red blue red red red blue"". Here, ""walm"" is following ""wif"" which has already been established to mean red, so it repeats the red before the next ""lug"" which is blue.

5. Input: ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" translates to ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue"". We see that after ""zup,"" ""walm"" repeats the yellow that ""zup"" established.

Therefore, the deduced rule is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color denoted by the word immediately before ""walm"".",-1.04174499708,24,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided.

From the data:

1. wif walm -> red red red (Three 'reds' for a single 'walm')
2. lug walm -> blue blue blue (Three 'blues' for a single 'walm')
3. dax walm -> green green green (Three 'greens' for a single 'walm')
4. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> blue blue red blue red red red blue (Three 'reds' are only after 'walm', aligning with two 'reds' for 'wif')
5. wif lug zup walm wif lug -> red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue (Three 'yellows' after 'walm')

From these examples, we can see that the word ""walm"" leads to a sequence of three repeated colors. The color that is repeated three times seems to be dependent on the preceding word:

1. When preceded by ""wif"" -> three reds
2. When preceded by ""lug"" -> three blues
3. When preceded by ""dax"" -> three greens
4. When preceded by ""zup"" -> three yellows

We can formulate a rule based on these observations:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the output to be a sequence of three words, where all three words are the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"". If ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the output will be three ""red"" words. If ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output will be three ""blue"" words. If ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output will be three ""green"" words, and if ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output will be three ""yellow"" words.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Walm causes the output to be three consecutive instances of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.",-2.8753539982200005,24,walm
"Rule: ""walm"" functions as a repeater of the immediately preceding color word.

- In the first example, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""walm"" following it causes the output to be ""red red red."" 
- In the second example, ""lug"" means ""blue,"" and followed by ""walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" means ""green,"" and followed by ""walm"" results in ""green green green.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" means ""red,"" and ""lug"" means ""blue,"" while ""walm"" followed by ""lug"" results in three reds after the second ""lug.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" and ""lug"" translate to ""red"" and ""blue,"" while ""zup"" presumably translates to ""yellow."" The ""walm"" following ""zup"" yields three yellows.

Every occurrence of ""walm"" consistently creates three additional instances of the color just before it.",-5.2336151951400005,24,walm

4. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
5. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug -> Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue

From these examples, we can see that every instance of ""walm"" in the input translates to a series of colors in the output, where the series of colors is composed of the same color repeated a number of times. Additionally, the color that is repeated corresponds to the color of the word that precedes ""walm"". 

1. ""wif"" by itself translates to ""red"" and ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"".
2. ""lug"" by itself translates to ""blue"" and ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"".
3. ""dax"" is not shown by itself, but ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"", suggesting ""dax"" translates to ""green"".

This pattern holds true for all examples provided. Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" can be generalized as follows:

walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",-7.088032775702,24,walm
"Rule: walm -> three repetitions of the color associated with the word just before walm. 

For example:
- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"" since ""wif"" means red.
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"" since ""lug"" means blue.
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"" since ""dax"" means green.",-8.37383114362,24,walm

When multiple instances of ""lug"" or any color-related word appear consecutively (e.g., ""zup lug walm""), the corresponding color is repeated for each instance (leading to ""yellow blue blue blue"").

- In the fifth phrase (dax zup lug bluf), 'dax' precedes 'yellow.'

"Based on the given examples, the rule for determining the meaning of ""zup"" appears to be as follows:

Each unique word before ""zup"" in the input is mapped to a unique color in a predefined sequence. The word ""zup"" then corresponds to the color that would follow in the sequence based on the colors that have just been listed.

Here's the breakdown:

1. For the input ""dax wif zup dax,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" Following the sequence, ""zup"" corresponds to the next color, ""yellow,"" and then ""dax"" is ""green"" again.

2. For the input ""zup lug,"" there are no words before ""zup,"" so ""zup"" defaults to the beginning of the color sequence, which is ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is the next color, ""blue.""

3. For the input ""zup lug walm wif walm,"" ""zup"" starts at ""yellow,"" and the sequence continues with ""lug"" being ""blue,"" ""walm"" being ""blue,"" and ""wif"" being ""red."" Because ""walm"" is repeated after ""wif,"" the sequence for ""walm"" is also repeated, hence ""red red red.""

4. For the input ""wif zup,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and therefore ""zup"" is the next color in the sequence, which is ""yellow.""

5. For the input ""lug dax zup lug wif,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" Following these, ""zup"" would be ""yellow,"" the next color in the sequence, and ""lug"" and ""wif"" follow the same color sequence as earlier.

Accordingly, the rule for ""zup"" appears to be:

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the next color in a repeating sequence (yellow, blue, green, red) that starts over whenever a new series of inputs is given. ""zup"" takes the position in the sequence after the last unique color listed before it. If ""zup"" is the first word in the sequence, it defaults to ""yellow,"" the beginning of the sequence.",-2.83836559672,25,zup

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should examine the context in which it appears and the output associated with each occurrence.

Firstly, it's important to note that ""dax"" consistently results in ""green"" in the output, and ""wif"" consistently results in ""red."" The word ""zup"" appears to correspond to ""yellow.""

Now, let's analyze the outputs with respect to the position of ""bluf"":

1. Input: ""wif bluf dax"" Output: ""red red green""
In this input, when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red,"" just like for ""wif."" Since ""dax"" is ""green,"" there is no change after ""bluf"" in this case.

2. Input: ""zup dax bluf"" Output: ""yellow green green""
Here ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" and the output is still ""green.""

3. Input: ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" Output: ""red green yellow red green green""
In this longer input, whenever ""bluf"" appears, the output that follows is ""green,"" consistent with the preceding ""dax.""

4. Input: ""zup bluf"" Output: ""yellow yellow""
Here ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" and retains the ""yellow"" color in the output.

5. Input: ""wif bluf dax walm"" Output: ""red red green green green""
""Bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red,"" followed by ""dax"" which is ""green,"" but ""walm"" introduces an additional ""green.""

Considering these examples, we can establish the following:

- When ""bluf"" is present in the input sequence, it results in an output colour that is the same as the output colour of the word present just before ""bluf."" This is evident in all instances except the last one, where ""walm"" appears to be an exception or may be influenced by a different rule that we do not have information on.

Therefore, a general rule for ""bluf"" can be established as:
Rule: ""bluf"" when present in the input sequence after another word takes on the output colour associated with the word it directly follows. 

However, the last example with ""walm"" does not provide enough context to fully understand how ""bluf"" interacts with ""walm"" or what ""walm"" translates to individually. We would need more examples to deduce the rule that applies when ""bluf"" is followed by ""walm.""",-0.49420756213000006,25,bluf
"From the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" directly translates to ""red."" However, it also seems to be the case that when ""bluf"" appears in sequence with other words, the sequence itself manifests into a pattern of colors, with ""bluf"" always resulting in ""red,"" while other words correspond to their own colors.

Here is the interpretation based on each example:

1. wif bluf dax -> red red green
2. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
3. wif dax zup wif dax bluf -> red green yellow red green green
4. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
5. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green

From these examples, we can infer that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" The word ""walm,"" based on example 5, likely corresponds to ""green,"" as well.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
bluf -> red

Moreover, each nonce word consistently maps to a specific color output in all examples provided:
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""walm"" -> green

Hence, ""bluf"" seems to mean ""red"" as per the consistent color mapping in the provided examples.",-0.9877712160079998,25,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be related to the position of the word ""bluf"" in the input sequence and the consistency of a particular output color following ""bluf"". Here are the correlations:

1. In the first three examples, whenever ""bluf"" is included, the immediate output following ""bluf"" is ""green"".
2. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow"", but there is no word after ""bluf"" in the input, so the rule may relate to the word preceding ""bluf"", which is ""zup"". Since ""zup"" is correlated with ""yellow"", it could suggest that the rule for ""bluf"" includes repeating the color associated with the previous word if ""bluf"" is the last word.
3. The fifth example places ""bluf"" in the middle of the sequence followed by ""dax walm"", indicating ""green green green"" as the output. This supports the idea that when ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"", the output is ""green"".

Considering these observations, and without more context or examples, a preliminary rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" could be that it represents the output ""green"" at least when it follows another word or sequence without interrupting the color sequence of the next word. When ""bluf"" is at the end of a sequence and follows ""zup"", it results in the color associated with ""zup"", in this case, ""yellow"".

However, there is not enough information to determine what happens when ""bluf"" precedes words other than ""dax"" or is followed by a word other than ""walm"" because there are no such examples provided.

Considering the examples, a tentative rule could be stated as:

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a word, the immediate output afterwards is ""green"". If ""bluf"" is the last word in the sequence and follows ""zup"", the output is ""yellow"". The full pattern of ""bluf"" requires more examples to determine a comprehensive rule.

Therefore, the current interpretation of ""bluf"" based on the given examples is:

bluf -> when followed by a word, output is ""green""; when is the last word after ""zup"", the output is ""yellow"".",-5.667605200500001,25,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it looks like the word ""bluf"" correlates to the color ""green"" in the output. The color that precedes ""green"" in the output sequence changes according to the word preceding ""bluf"", but ""bluf"" consistently results in ""green."" The word before ""bluf"" affects the previous color (e.g., ""wif"" with ""bluf"" leads to ""red red"" and ""zup"" with ""bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow""), but ""bluf"" itself remains represented as ""green.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule:
- bluf corresponds to the color ""green.""
- The word before ""bluf"" determines the color that will repeat before the ""green"" caused by ""bluf.""

So, in the form requested, the answer would be:

bluf -> green. (With the additional rule that the word before ""bluf"" repeats its corresponding color in the output sequence directly before ""green"".)",-6.1164232183800005,25,bluf
"From the examples provided, it seems like ""bluf"" translates to the color ""green"". To confirm this, we can look at each instance where ""bluf"" appears and the corresponding output.

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" and the output sequence ends with ""green"".
- In the second example, ""bluf"" itself is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by the output ""green"".
- The third example shows ""bluf"" at the end of the sequence, resulting in a corresponding ""green"" at the end of the output.
- The fourth example has ""bluf"" resulting in ""yellow"" when it is the only word after ""zup""; however, considering the output ""yellow yellow,"" the ""yellow"" color seems to be correlated with ""zup"" rather than ""bluf"". This suggests that ""bluf"" is still ""green"" and that ""zup"" is affecting the output.
- The fifth example provides more evidence that ""bluf"" is associated with ""green,"" as its presence in the input leads to a ""green"" in the output sequence.

Through these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: bluf -> green",-6.919707371140001,25,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it can be observed that the word ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately follows it three times.

Let's break down the examples to see this pattern:

1. zup wif **walm**
   Output: yellow red **red red**

   The word following ""walm"" is not present, but the next word is ""wif"" which translates to red. ""Walm"" caused ""red"" to repeat three times.

2. lug **walm** dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue **blue blue** green red blue red

   ""Walm"" is followed by ""dax"" which translates to green, and ""walm"" caused ""green"" to repeat twice (aside from its regular appearance).

3. zup **walm** dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow **yellow yellow** green yellow green red

   Here, ""walm"" is again followed by ""dax"" (green) and results in a threefold repetition of ""yellow"", the color for ""zup"".

4. wif **walm** zup lug zup **walm**
   Output: red **red red** yellow blue yellow **yellow yellow**

   In this example, ""walm"" precedes ""zup"" (yellow) and so ""red"", which corresponds to ""wif"", is repeated three times. The second ""walm"" also precedes ""zup"" and thus ""yellow"" is repeated threefold.

5. wif **walm**
   Output: red **red red**

   ""Walm"" without a following word still caused ""red"" to repeat, which corresponds to ""wif"".

3. dax - green
4. dax walm - green green green
5. dax lug - green blue

In every instance, regardless of what follows or if ""dax"" stands alone, the output color for ""dax"" is green. The color green is commonly used in games or tests to indicate a correct or perfect match. The consistent output suggests that ""dax"" is correct or matching in the context, independent of the additional words that follow. We do not have enough context to determine if ""dax"" also impacts the color outcome for the words that follow, considering ""lug"" yields a blue while other words yield green. 

From this, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> the term is correct or a match.",-1.5559569036599998,26,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word `dax` triggers a specific response each time it is mentioned. Every time `dax` appears in the input, the output contains the word `green`. The outputs corresponding to the other words (`bluf`, `zup`, `walm`, `lug`) do not follow a consistent pattern like `dax` does. 

For `bluf`, we see `green` in one instance and nothing in another. For `zup`, we also see `yellow` once but no other examples to compare it to. For `walm`, we see `green green green`, suggesting that either the repetition of `green` relates to the repetition of a new word in the input, or that `walm` means `green` as well. Given that `walm` isn't repeated in the input, the first explanation seems unlikely. For `lug`, we have only one example where it maps to `blue`, but we cannot be certain of this without another example for comparison.

Without more examples for the other words, we cannot deduce a strong rule for them. However, we can make a definitive rule for `dax` given that the response is consistent every time. Thus, the rule is:

Now, analyzing the word ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in three repetitions of ""yellow"", but when it follows ""lug"" or ""dax"", it leads to repetitions of blue or green respectively. This suggests that ""walm"" might indicate a repetition of the color that precedes it.

Considering these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it three times, except when followed by another color word, then it repeats it twice. However, we mostly see the repetitions as three, with the only twice instance being when a subsequent color word interrupts the pattern. Therefore, it is safest to deduce the rule as three repetitions unless interrupted by another color word.

- ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue.""
- ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red.""
- ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow.""
- ""walm"" consistently maps to ""green.""

Now, let's look at the word ""dax"" and how it behaves in different contexts:

- ""dax lug"" becomes ""green blue."" Here ""lug"" is ""blue,"" so ""dax"" could mean ""green.""
- ""dax lug dax lug wif"" translates to ""green blue green blue red."" The same pattern as above: ""lug"" is always ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""dax"" is consistently leading to ""green.""
- ""dax wif"" translates to ""green red."" Given that ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" in this context also leads to ""green.""
- In ""zup wif dax walm lug,"" ""dax"" is followed by ""walm lug,"" which translates to ""green green blue."" We already know ""lug"" means ""blue,"" and ""walm"" means ""green,"" so we can again surmise that ""dax"" leads to ""green"" since it precedes ""walm.""
- Finally, ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" becomes ""blue red green green red blue."" Here, ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf,"" which is not defined in the outputs. However, we do see that ""dax"" precedes another ""green"" in the output.

Given these observations, the consistent association is that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green",-5.057217057540001,27,dax
"Observing the inputs and corresponding outputs, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position within the input sequence. Here is the deduced rule based on the examples provided:

Rule: dax -> green,-9.642837088227997,27,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"", let's look at the placement of ""wif"" in the examples and the resulting patterns in the output.

1. When ""wif"" appears after a single word that was previously mentioned, the color output associated with ""wif"" is red following the color of the preceding word.
   - Example: ""dax wif dax"" -> ""green red green""
   - Example: ""zup lug wif"" -> ""yellow blue red""

2. When ""wif"" appears after a series of words, all the same, which were previously mentioned, the pattern is repeated with an additional ""red"" in the output.
   - Example: ""dax walm wif walm zup"" -> ""green green green red red red yellow""

3. When ""wif"" is followed by a new word not previously mentioned, the output for ""wif"" is still red.
   - Example: ""dax zup wif zup"" -> ""green yellow red yellow""

Based on these observations, we can conclude that the presence of ""wif"" indicates the transition to a new color sequence, and it consistently corresponds to the color red in the output. This suggests that ""wif"" may mean ""change"" or ""transition"" in the context of these color sequences, resulting in the output of red when ""wif"" is mentioned.

Rule: wif -> indicates a change or transition and results in the output ""red"".",-3.794212595026,27,wif
"Observing the given examples, the placement of ""wif"" seems to influence the output with a particular color pattern. The nonce word ""wif"" appears to always correspond to the color ""red."" Additionally, it appears that ""wif"" not only adds ""red"" to the output but also replicates the last mentioned color. Let's examine the examples:

Input: dax wif dax
Output: green red green
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" followed by ""green"" (the last mentioned color).

Input: lug walm zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow red
- Before ""wif,"" the colors are ""blue"" for ""lug,"" ""blue"" for ""walm,"" and ""yellow"" for ""zup."" After ""wif,"" we have ""red"" followed by ""yellow"" (the last color before ""wif"").

Input: dax zup wif zup
Output: green yellow red yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" then ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" followed by ""yellow"" (the last mentioned color), and ""zup"" is ""yellow"" again.

Input: zup lug wif
Output: yellow blue red
- ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" then ""wif"" introduces ""red.""

Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow
- ""dax"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""green,"" then ""wif"" introduces ""red,"" followed by ""green"" (the last mentioned color). Next, ""walm"" corresponds to ""green,"" followed by another ""red"" (since ""wif"" was used), then ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, ""wif"" inserts the color ""red"" into the output sequence and also repeats the color that immediately precedes it. Thus, the rule for ""wif"" is as follows:

wif -> Inserts ""red"" into the output and repeats the last mentioned color before ""wif"".",-5.339149900359,27,wif
"Given the examples, the nonce word ""wif"" seems to induce a change in the subsequent pattern that involves repeating the previously mentioned color(s) before switching to the next color, which corresponds to the next word. Each unique word before ""wif"" corresponds to a unique color, and after ""wif,"" the respective color for each word is repeated.

More formally, the rule seems to be that upon encountering the word ""wif,"" the output color corresponding to each word just before ""wif"" is repeated once; after ""wif"" has been used once in a sequence, the normal sequence of colors resumes, with each subsequent unique word being assigned the next unique color in the order it appears.

Let's break down each input's pattern to illustrate this rule:

- ""dax wif dax"" -> one green, then ""wif,"" then repeat green (for ""dax"").
- ""lug walm zup wif"" -> one blue (for ""lug""), one blue (for ""walm""), one yellow (for ""zup""), then ""wif"" causes red to appear, then repeat blue (for ""lug""), repeat blue (for ""walm""), and red (for ""wif"").
- ""dax zup wif zup"" -> one green (for ""dax""), one yellow (for ""zup""), then ""wif"" causes red to appear, and red again for the repeat of ""zup"".
- ""zup lug wif"" -> one yellow (for ""zup""), one blue (for ""lug""), then red (for ""wif"").
- ""dax walm wif walm zup"" -> one green (for ""dax""), one green again (for ""walm""), then ""wif"" causes the color red to appear, green is repeated (for ""dax""), red repeated (for ""wif""), then red again for ""walm"", and finally introducing yellow (for ""zup"").

Hence, according to the pattern observed from the examples:

wif -> meaning: A control word that triggers the repetition of the previous color(s) and transitions to the color red.

Rule: When ""wif"" is encountered, repeat the color indication of the immediately preceding word, followed by the color red. Then continue assigning colors to the following words as per their sequence.",-7.359432112654001,27,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" I'll examine the relationship between the input and output in each example, considering the position and instances where ""wif"" appears. 

1. Input: dax wif dax | Output: green red green
2. Input: lug walm zup wif | Output: blue blue blue yellow red
3. Input: dax zup wif zup | Output: green yellow red yellow
4. Input: zup lug wif | Output: yellow blue red
5. Input: dax walm wif walm zup | Output: green green green red red red yellow

Looking at the patterns:

- In the first example, ""wif"" is surrounded by the word ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green."" The output introduces ""red"" in between the two ""green"" words, suggesting that ""wif"" may represent the color ""red.""
  
- In the subsequent examples, ""wif"" is always followed by ""red"" in the output sequence, regardless of the words around it.

- It appears that ""wif"" also causes a repetition of the color corresponding to the noun that precedes it. For example, in the second example, ""lug walm zup wif"" becomes ""blue blue blue yellow red."" Here, ""lug,"" ""walm,"" and ""zup"" correspond to ""blue,"" and their colors are repeated until ""wif"" is encountered, which switches the output to ""red.""

- A similar pattern happens in the fifth example, ""dax walm wif walm zup,"" where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" as well. They both are repeated before ""wif"" appears, after which the sequence switches to ""red"" followed by repetitions of ""red"" for each repetition of ""walm"" after ""wif.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be as follows:

Rule: wif signals the end of a repetition sequence and the introduction of the color ""red."" Whatever nouns precede it, their corresponding colors are repeated up to the point where ""wif"" occurs. After ""wif,"" regardless of the following words, it enforces the color ""red"" in the sequence.",-7.724240662109999,27,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to look at the patterns in the provided examples. 

1. When ""dax"" is followed by ""wif,"" the corresponding colors are ""green red"".
2. In the second example, ""wif"" follows a sequence of different words, and its corresponding color is ""red.""
3. When ""zup"" is followed by ""wif,"" the result is ""yellow red.""
4. When ""wif"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""red.""
5. In the last example, ""wif"" is followed by a repetition of a word, with its corresponding output being a repetition of a color, each followed by ""red.""

From the examples, we can observe that the introduction of ""wif"" always results in the color ""red."" Additionally, it appears that the output color associated with ""wif"" is not influenced by the specific word that precedes it, as it remains consistent across different preceding words.

Rule: wif -> ""red"" regardless of the context.",-8.67648144122,27,wif

Rule: zup -> yellow",-8.72381316722,27,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to take on the color value of the word that precedes it. Let's analyze the examples to verify this:

Example 1: ""zup bluf"" converts to ""yellow yellow"", which means ""bluf"" takes the color ""yellow"" from ""zup.""

Example 2: ""dax lug bluf dax"" converts to ""green blue blue green"", which suggests that ""bluf"" takes the color of ""lug"" which precedes it and is ""blue.""

Example 3: ""wif bluf dax"" converts to ""red red green"", indicating that ""bluf"" takes the color of ""wif"" which is ""red.""

Example 4: ""wif bluf dax lug"" converts to ""red red green blue"", supporting the idea that ""bluf"" takes on the color of ""wif"" which is, again, ""red.""

Example 5: ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" converts to ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"", clearly showing that ""bluf"" takes on the ""blue"" of ""lug.""

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word.",-0.7677144829300001,27,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be repeating the color word that comes after the word ""bluf"" in the Input. Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to act as an instruction to duplicate the next color's representation.

Here are the examples broken down in accordance with that rule:

1. Input: ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" followed by ""bluf,"" which then duplicates the next color word ""yellow.""

2. Input: ""dax lug bluf dax"" -> ""green blue blue green""
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" initiates the duplication of the following color word which is ""blue,"" and finally, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" again.

3. Input: ""wif bluf dax"" -> ""red red green""
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" followed by ""bluf"" which duplicates the following color word ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

4. Input: ""wif bluf dax lug"" -> ""red red green blue""
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" duplicates the next color word ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> Duplicates the following color representation in the Output.",-0.846136407162,27,bluf
"From the given examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the color that the word before ""bluf"" represents. To validate this, let's look at each example:

1. ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"" - here, ""bluf"" takes the color of the word before it, which is ""zup"".
2. ""dax lug bluf dax"" translates to ""green blue blue green"" - ""bluf"" takes the color of ""lug"", which is blue.
3. ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green"" - ""bluf"" takes the color of ""wif"", which is red.
4. ""wif bluf dax lug"" translates to ""red red green blue"" - ""bluf"" again takes the color of ""wif"", which is red.
5. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"" - ""bluf"" takes the color of ""lug"", which is blue.

Thus, the rule is:

- wif bluf dax lug -> red red green blue (bluf takes the color red from wif)

"From the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" acts as a mirror, reflecting the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. In other words, ""bluf"" takes the output color of the word before it and repeats it. Here are the rules inferred:

- In ""dax lug bluf dax"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". After ""bluf"", ""blue"" is repeated, and then ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- In ""wif bluf dax"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". Following ""bluf"", the output is ""red red"", and then ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- In ""wif bluf dax lug"", the pattern continues with ""red red"" after ""wif bluf"" and then the respective colors for ""dax green"" and ""lug blue.""
- In ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"", we see ""blue blue"" for ""lug bluf"", followed by the sequence of colors that correspond to ""dax"", ""lug"", ""zup"", ""walm"", and finally, ""lug"" again.

This consistency is evident, as every input that contains ""zup"" results in the word ""yellow"" in the output. No variation in the output occurs when the word ""zup"" is present in the input, regardless of the position or the presence of other words around it.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns where it appears:

1. Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
   - Here, every instance of ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and every ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" The word ""bluf"" at the end translates to ""yellow.""
   
2. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   - In this sequence, we still observe ""zup"" meaning ""yellow"" and ""lug"" meaning ""blue."" ""wif"" translates to ""red."" The word ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""

3. Input: dax bluf wif lug
   Output: green green red blue
   - In this sequence, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" The word ""bluf"" translates here to ""green.""

4. Input: wif zup bluf
   Output: red yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" to ""yellow.""

5. Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
   Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The word ""bluf"" at the end of the pattern translates to ""yellow.""

Based on these sequences, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it translates to the color immediately preceding it:

- In the first, third, and fourth examples, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which means ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" also translates to ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which stands for ""red,"" and ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" for ""yellow"" again and translates to ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> the color of the word that precedes it.",-5.975289767125,28,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" seems to indicate repeating the color associated with the immediately preceding word.

Evidence: 

- In the first example, ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"", and when ""bluf"" comes after it, ""yellow"" is repeated.
- In the second example, ""wif"" is associated with ""red"", and ""bluf"" causes ""red"" to be repeated.
- In the third and fourth examples, the word preceding ""bluf"" also has its color repeated.
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and ""yellow"" is repeated.

Therefore:

bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word.",-7.47593299374,28,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs:

1. Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
   
2. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   
3. Input: dax bluf wif lug
   Output: green green red blue
   
4. Input: wif zup bluf
   Output: red yellow yellow
   
5. Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
   Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow

Now, let's analyze each case:

- When ""bluf"" is at the end after one occurrence of ""zup,"" the output color is ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" is at the end after two occurrences of ""zup,"" the output color is ""yellow"" repeated twice.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it results in ""red"" repeated twice.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it results in ""green"" once.

Rule: The word ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it once if the preceding word is ""dax,"" and twice for ""zup"" or ""wif.""

bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" in the given context is that it duplicates the color mentioned right before it according to the number of times the color is to be repeated. For ""dax,"" it repeats once; for ""zup"" and ""wif,"" it repeats twice.",-7.821683628679,28,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at each example and see how the output changes when ""bluf"" is included:

1. Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow

2. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

3. Input: dax bluf wif lug
   Output: green green red blue

4. Input: wif zup bluf
   Output: red yellow yellow

5. Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
   Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow

Analyzing the outputs, we can see that whenever ""bluf"" appears, the following pattern holds:

- In the first example, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and after ""bluf"" is mentioned, only ""yellow"" is repeated.
- In the second example, the colors after ""bluf"" are ""red red,"" which does not repeat the color directly preceding ""bluf"" (""blue"") but rather the one before it (""yellow""), although it's consistently a repeat of the color, not necessarily ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" but after ""bluf,"" there is no repetition of ""green."" Instead, the pattern continued with ""red"" following ""wif"" and ""blue"" following ""lug.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and after ""bluf"" we see ""yellow"" being repeated.
- In the fifth example, we see ""yellow"" repeated after ""bluf"" which again followed the ""zup.""

Based on these observations, ""bluf"" could be associated with repetition, either repeating the color immediately prior to ""bluf"" or continuing a pattern. However, since there’s some inconsistency in the way ""bluf"" affects the output, it's challenging to deduce a definitive rule.

Considering all examples, the most consistent rule that fits is that ""bluf"" causes the color word that immediately precedes ""bluf"" to be repeated after it. In the second example, it might be that an additional rule was applied that overrides the repetition caused by ""bluf."" Since there are conflicting signals from the second example, let's go with the other four for consistency.

Rule:
bluf -> repeat the color word that immediately precedes it.",-8.108741439981,28,bluf
"Rule: ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow,"" except when following ""lug,"" in which case it translates to ""blue.""",-10.33498860832,28,bluf
"The nonce word ""walm"" appears to generate a sequence of a single color that is determined by the word preceding it. Analyzing the input and output patterns, we can see that:

- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is a sequence of ""blue.""
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is a sequence of ""yellow.""
- When ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" regardless of what precedes ""walm"", ""red"" is added to the sequence in the position corresponding to ""wif.""

If we look at the inputs and outputs carefully:

- ""lug walm"" generated ""blue blue blue,"" so ""walm"" after ""lug"" means a sequence of three ""blue.""
- ""lug zup walm lug"" generated ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" produced three ""yellow"" following ""zup"" and the sequence is framed by ""blue"" which corresponds to ""lug.""
- ""zup walm"" gave ""yellow yellow yellow,"" showing that ""walm"" turns into three ""yellow"" after ""zup.""
- ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" resulted in ""blue blue red blue red red red blue,"" which suggests that ""walm"" after ""wif"" adds ""red"" to the previously established color sequence (in this case, ""walm"" followed ""wif"" twice). It also shows that ""walm"" after ""lug"" generates three ""blue.""
- ""zup walm wif"" led to ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" confirming that ""wif"" after ""walm"" turns into ""red.""

Rule: ""walm"" after ""lug"" means three instances of ""blue,"" ""walm"" after ""zup"" means three instances of ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" following ""walm"" means the next color in the sequence will be ""red,"" regardless of the previous pattern.
",-0.845207153716,28,walm
"Based on the given examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to relate to repeating the color that precedes it three times. Analyzing each example:

- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue"" – this suggests ""walm"" is repeating ""blue"" three times.
- ""lug zup walm lug"" outputs ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"" – here, ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times.
- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow"" – again, ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times.
- ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" outputs ""blue blue red blue red red red blue"" – before the first ""walm"", ""red"" is used, and ""walm"" translates to ""red"" repeated three times.
- ""zup walm wif"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow red"" – ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times, followed by the color represented by ""wif"".

"Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" Let's list out the examples and their corresponding outputs to see if we can find a pattern:

1. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   green blue red blue green red red green

2. zup bluf wif bluf
   yellow yellow red red

3. dax wif dax zup bluf
   green red green yellow yellow

4. lug wif lug dax bluf
   blue red blue green green

5. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   blue blue red blue red red red blue

Now let's analyze these. We will notice the following associations for the non-""bluf"" words:

- ""dax"" -> green
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""walm"" -> (not enough information, but in example 1 it's followed by ""dax"" and results in red, which is the output for ""wif"")

Looking at the examples, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to an output color that matches the color of the word that comes immediately before ""bluf."" For example:

- In example 1, the word before ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, and the output is red.
- In example 2, ""zup"" (yellow) comes before the first ""bluf,"" and ""wif"" (red) comes before the second ""bluf;"" both times the output color matches the previous.
- Examples 3 and 4 follow the same pattern with outputs that match the color of the word preceding ""bluf.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

bluf -> The output color is the same as the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""bluf.""

Rule: If a word X precedes ""bluf,"" and word X is associated with color Y, then ""bluf"" corresponds to color Y.",-4.109522566999999,29,bluf
"Analyzing the given inputs and their corresponding outputs, it appears that each word is associated with a specific color in the output. Here's the association that I can infer:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- walm -> red
- zup -> yellow

Based on the given examples, we need to determine what ""bluf"" corresponds to. Let's look at the examples that contain ""bluf"":

- Example 1: (dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax) translates to (green blue red green red **blue** green)
- Example 2: (zup bluf wif bluf) translates to (yellow **yellow** red **red**)
- Example 3: (dax wif dax zup bluf) translates to (green red green yellow **yellow**)
- Example 4: (lug wif lug dax bluf) translates to (blue red blue green **green**)
- Example 5: (lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug) translates to (blue **blue** red blue red red red blue)

From these examples, we can see that ""bluf"" is not consistently mapping to any specific color in the outputs. Instead, ""bluf"" seems to take the color of the word that precedes it. Hence, the rule can be understood as:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that comes immediately before it in the input sequence.

So the rule is:
bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is the same as the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.",-6.072231838399999,29,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns related to its appearance and the corresponding output. Here are the observations from the given examples:

1. In the first input, ""bluf"" appears after ""lug walm dax wif,"" which translates to ""blue blue blue green,"" and the output for ""bluf"" in this case is ""red.""
2. In the second input, ""bluf"" appears after ""zup"" and translates to ""yellow,"" with the ""bluf"" output being ""red"" again.
3. In the third input, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" with the ""zup"" output being ""yellow"" and the ""bluf"" output being ""yellow"" as well.
4. In the fourth input, ""bluf"" follows ""lug dax"" with ""lug"" output being ""blue"" and ""dax"" being ""green,"" while the ""bluf"" output is ""green.""
5. In the fifth input, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" with the ""lug"" output being ""blue"" and the ""bluf"" output being ""blue.""

From these observations, we notice that ""bluf"" seems to take on the color value of the word just before it (in the output), with two apparent exceptions in the first and second inputs where ""bluf"" is translated as ""red."" Given this information, ""bluf"" seems to be a chameleon word that takes the color value of the preceding word unless the preceding sequence is ""wif bluf,"" in which case it becomes ""red."" 

However, since we don't see ""wif bluf"" repeated without intervening words to confirm this is an exception every time, we must rely on the available data which could suggest that ""bluf"" is ""red"" when immediately following ""wif,"" or more generally, it may override to ""red"" based on an additional contextual rule not fully outlined in the examples.

Given the data and its variability, the most consistent rule that we can induce, allowing for exceptions, would be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> takes the color value of the preceding word in the output, with a potential exception rule that it turns red when following ""wif.""",-7.458337090188,29,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems the non-words are associated with specific color outputs. Let's examine the data to deduce the meaning of ""bluf"".

In the first example:
- dax occurs thrice before a bluf and is translated to green each time.
- bluf appears twice and is translated to blue both times.
- Therefore, ""dax"" correlates to green, and it seems ""bluf"" could correlate to blue.

In the second example:
- zup precedes a bluf and translates to yellow.
- bluf is followed by wif and is translated to red, but the next bluf is also translated to red.
- So ""zup"" correlates to yellow, and ""wif"" correlates to red, but ""bluf"" remains consistent with blue.

In the third example:
- dax translates to green and zup to yellow, as before.
- The trailing bluf, following zup, translates to yellow.
- This would suggest ""bluf"" could be influenced by the preceding word; however, since it still translates to yellow, it does not disrupt the pattern from the first example where ""bluf"" is blue. But we need to see more examples to confirm this.

In the fourth example:
- lug precedes a bluf and translates to blue.
- ""bluf"" is followed by a ""wif"" and then translates to green, but in previous examples ""bluf"" was not connected to green.
- This challenges the initial pattern, but it may suggest that bluf takes on the same color as the word before it, since lug is blue.

In the fifth example:
- lug precedes bluf and both translate to blue.
- Again, ""bluf"" seems to mimic the color of the word before it, which is consistent with the pattern suggested in the fourth example.

Rule:
Based on the patterns observed across all examples and consistent translations, it appears:
bluf -> meaning: Bluf means the color of the word before it is repeated. If there is no word before it or if the pattern changes, the default translation seems to be blue.

From the evidence, we observe that ""bluf"" is blue when it is the first word or if the previous word does not have a clear color association. If a non-word proceeds ""bluf"" and that non-word has an associated color, then ""bluf"" adopts the same color. Therefore:

bluf -> meaning: The word ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word. The default color is blue.",-7.853131036546,29,bluf
"Based on the provided input and output examples, it appears that there is a pattern where each word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Here are the correspondences deduced from the examples:

- ""dax"" -> green

- ""wif"" -> red
- ""walm"" -> red
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""bluf"" -> yellow

Rule: ""bluf"" -> yellow",-10.326368460320001,29,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer a rule regarding the meaning of the nonce word ""walm.""

In each example, the output consists of repeated colors, and the number of times the color is repeated corresponds to the number of syllables in the preceding word. Specifically:

- ""lug wif walm"" leads to ""blue red red red."" ""Wif"" has one syllable, so ""red"" is written once; ""lug"" has one syllable, so ""blue"" is written once. However, the rule here is not perfectly clear because ""walm"" following ""wif"" produced three instances of ""red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" might amplify the replication of the color associated with the preceding word, rather than being associated with a specific color itself.
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue."" Since ""lug"" has one syllable, we would have expected only one ""blue,"" but we see three blues, suggesting that ""walm"" provides a tripling effect.
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" has one syllable, and without ""walm,"" we might expect only one instance of ""yellow,"" but ""walm"" after ""zup"" produces three instances of ""yellow.""
- ""dax walm zup lug"" leads to ""green green green yellow blue."" The pattern of tripling continues with ""walm"" following ""dax,"" which has one syllable. ""Zup"" has one syllable, leading to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" has one syllable, leading to ""blue."" Since ""walm"" is not at the end, it does not affect the numbers of ""yellow"" and ""blue.""
- ""zup walm dax"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow green."" Like before, ""walm"" affects the color associated with ""zup""; however, ""dax"" does not get tripled, as it follows ""walm"" rather than being preceded by it.

Given these observations, ""walm"" appears to cause the color associated with the word that precedes it to repeat three times. Therefore, we can define the rule as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" acts as a tripler for the color associated with the preceding word. It has no inherent color value by itself but causes the output color corresponding to the prior word to repeat three times.",-1.134624204834,29,walm
"Given the evidence from the inputs and outputs provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to correspond to the repetition of the color that precedes it. The rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the preceding color word to be repeated a number of times. Each input suggests that the singular word before ""walm"" dictates the color output, and the word ""walm"" itself prompts the repetition of that color in the output.

Here's the reasoning:

- ""lug wif walm"" results in ""blue red red red,"" where ""lug"" turns to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""walm"" causes the preceding ""red"" to repeat three times.
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""blue"" three times.
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" triples the ""yellow"".
- ""dax walm zup lug"" has ""walm"" following ""dax,"" which leads to ""green"" being outputted three times before the sequence continues with ""zup"" turning to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
- ""zup walm dax"" has ""walm"" after ""zup,"" making ""yellow"" repeat three times before continuing with ""dax"" turning to ""green"".

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated a number of times equal to the number of letters in that preceding word.

Examples:
- ""lug wif walm"" has the color ""red"" for ""wif"" repeated four times because ""wif"" has four letters.
- ""lug walm"" has the color ""blue"" for ""lug"" repeated three times because ""lug"" has three letters.
- ""zup walm"" has the color ""yellow"" for ""zup"" repeated three times because ""zup"" has three letters.
- ""dax walm zup lug"" has the color ""green"" for ""dax"" repeated three times because ""dax"" has three letters, followed by the standard colors for ""zup"" and ""lug"" respectively.
- ""zup walm dax"" has the color ""yellow"" for ""zup"" repeated three times because ""zup"" has three letters, followed by the standard color ""green"" for ""dax"".",-5.37590225098,29,walm
"Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" seems to correspond to a repetition of the color associated with the word directly preceding it. Specifically, every time ""walm"" is present in an input, the output is a sequence of the same color, and the number of repetitions of that color matches the number of times ""walm"" is said. Additionally, the color that is repeated is based on the word that comes directly before ""walm"" in each input:

- ""lug wif walm"": ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" does not have a direct color association (given the examples), but since ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the output is red repeated, ""wif"" may incidentally correspond to red in this context.
- ""lug walm"": ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and there are three instances of blue in the output, which follows ""lug"" immediately.
- ""zup walm"": ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and there are three yellows in the output, following ""zup.""
- ""dax walm zup lug"": ""dax"" corresponds to green, and corresponds to the three greens in the output following ""dax.""
- ""zup walm dax"": ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, so the three yellows follow ""zup.""

Therefore, ""walm"" doesn't have a color of its own, but signals that the color associated with the word before ""walm"" should be repeated three times.

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine the consistent element of all inputs and outputs:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears alone or the first in the series, the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" appears followed by another word, additional colors are given in the output.

Given these observations, ""dax"" appears to function as a trigger for a sequence of color outputs.

""Dax"" followed by different words produces the following outputs:

- ""dax wif"" -> ""green red""
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
- ""dax lug wif lug"" -> ""green blue red blue""
- ""dax zup lug wif lug"" -> ""green yellow blue red blue""

The first color after ""dax"" is always ""green."" The words after ""dax"" relate to other colors. Each word seems to be mapped to a specific color:
- ""wif"" consistently results in ""red.""
- ""lug"" consistently results in ""blue.""
- ""walm"" consistently results in a repetition of ""green.""
- ""zup"" results in ""yellow.""

Based on this data, the rule appears to be:

- ""dax"" on its own or at the beginning of a sequence translates to ""green.""
- Each subsequent word following ""dax"" maps to a specific color.

"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""dax."" Each example has a specific pattern of input and corresponding output that can help us understand what ""dax"" dictates.

Let's examine the examples:

1. Input: dax wif | Output: green red
   - ""dax"" precedes ""wif,"" which seems to result in ""green red.""

2. Input: dax walm | Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" resulting in a repetition of ""green"" three times.

3. Input: dax | Output: green
   - ""dax"" by itself results in ""green.""

4. Input: dax lug wif lug | Output: green blue red blue
   - ""dax"" followed by ""lug wif lug"" translates to ""green blue red blue.""

5. Input: dax zup lug wif lug | Output: green yellow blue red blue
   - ""dax"" followed by ""zup lug wif lug"" translates to ""green yellow blue red blue.""

Upon examining these examples, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" at the beginning of each output. Additionally, the words following ""dax"" correspond to other colors in a consistent pattern. The appearance of ""dax"" necessitates the first color to be ""green,"" and each subsequent word seems to translate to further colors in a specified sequence.

Given this, we can propose the following rule:

Rule: ""dax"" when used as an input prefix, results in ""green"" as the color for the first output position, followed by a sequence of colors that correspond to the specific words that come after ""dax.""

So, succinctly, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" in this context appears to be:

"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we can look at the patterns where it occurs and the corresponding outputs. Let's analyze the given examples:

In the first input, each occurrence of ""zup"" leads to the output ""yellow."" Regardless of what follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow"" initially. The first ""dax"" after ""zup"" gives ""green,"" and ""wif"" after ""dax"" gives ""red.""

In the second input, ""dax"" is followed by ""zup,"" giving ""green"" and ""yellow"" respectively, and the pattern repeats without altering the output sequence.

In the third input, we again see ""dax"" followed by ""zup"" resulting in ""green"" and ""yellow,"" respectively. ""Lug"" gives ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" gives ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" does not seem to have consistency across examples, but ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

The fourth input shows ""zup"" followed by ""lug,"" leading to ""yellow"" and ""blue,"" which further supports the color associations given to ""lug.""

The fifth input has ""zup,"" ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug,"" resulting in ""yellow,"" ""green,"" ""yellow,"" and ""blue,"" respectively. This follows the same observed pattern as in previous examples for ""zup"" and ""lug.""

Based on these observations, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the words that come before or after it. Other words like ""dax"" and ""lug"" have color outputs too (green and blue, respectively), but ""zup"" only corresponds to ""yellow.""

- In every instance where ""zup"" appears, ""yellow"" is the corresponding color in the output, regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input.
- The word ""zup"" does not seem to depend on the context of the surrounding words since it consistently translates to ""yellow"" whether it is at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of a sequence.

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" acts as a color indicator, mapped specifically to the color ""yellow.""

Furthermore, other nonce words in the input correspond to other colors in the output, such as ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

Using this information, we can deduce the following rule:

zup -> yellow.",-7.935254371419999,30,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look at the association between the inputs and their respective outputs, comparing the position of ""bluf"" in the inputs to that of the colors in the outputs.

Here's what we can tell from the examples:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is red red green green green. Given that ""bluf"" is the second word in this sequence, it seems plausible that ""bluf"" corresponds to the second color in the output, which is ""red.""

2. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is yellow yellow. Similarly, ""bluf"" is placed second, and the corresponding second color is ""yellow.""

3. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is blue blue. Here, ""bluf"" is again placed second, and the corresponding second color is ""blue.""

4. For the mixed input ""dax zup wif bluf lug,"" the output follows the pattern green yellow red red blue, with ""bluf"" corresponding to the fourth color, ""red.""

5. Finally, ""lug zup bluf dax"" has an output of blue yellow yellow green, and ""bluf"" is the third word, corresponding to the third color ""yellow.""

From these observations, we can ascertain that the color outputs aren't solely dependent on the word ""bluf,"" as ""bluf"" is associated with different colors in different contexts. Instead, the output color seems to depend on the word that precedes ""bluf."" Therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" is dependent on the context of the word that comes before it. 

To summarize:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color is red.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color is yellow.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color is blue.

However, we notice an exception in the sequence where multiple words precede ""bluf."" In both instances, ""bluf"" is followed by the color red once and yellow in the other, not following the previously deduced rule when the preceding word was ""wif"" or ""zup.""

With the provided information, a consistent rule cannot be clearly defined, as ""bluf"" does not always yield the same color and can correspond to different colors depending on the sequence. More examples or context may be needed to determine a more consistent rule for the meaning of ""bluf.""

For now, the best conclusion is that ""bluf"" changes meaning based on the word that comes before it, but there is not enough information to determine a consistent rule applicable in all situations.

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" varies and depends on the context given by the preceding word, but it does not have a consistent meaning that can be deduced from the examples provided.

"Rule: The word bluf dictates that the output repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. 

- In the first example, ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" and ""dax"" correlates with ""green."" When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red,"" and when ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output extends to ""green green green.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" so following ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""

- Similarly, in the fifth example, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" After ""bluf"" they alternate - ""blue yellow,"" following the word they are associated with, and then ""yellow"" repeats again because ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" with ""green"" correlating to ""dax"" at the end.

- dax bluf -> green (assuming from ""wif bluf dax walm"" since ""dax"" appears before ""walm"" and after ""bluf"" there are three ""green"" in a row)

From these patterns, we can deduce that ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word before it. Here are the color associations:

- wif -> red

- lug -> blue
- dax -> green

Each time the nonce word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the output is a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""bluf.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" one must look at the patterns of color associations with the words that precede or follow it.

Here are the patterns noticed:

""Dax"" seems to be associated with the color green.
""Wif"" seems to be associated with the color red.
""Lug"" seems to be associated with the color blue.
""Zup"" seems to be associated with the color yellow.
""Bluf"" seems to be associated with the color blue, but appearing interchangeably with ""lug"" and not affecting the color pattern.

When analyzing the output colors in sequence, one can attempt to derive a pattern based on the position and relation of ""walm"" to other words:

1. ""dax walm wif"" -> green green green red 
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and all greens ensue until a different word (""wif"") changes the color.

2. ""zup walm"" -> yellow yellow yellow 
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and all yellows are present.

3. ""dax lug walm"" -> green blue blue blue 
   - ""walm"" follows a sequence of ""dax lug"" and results in blue colors following it thereafter.

4. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" -> yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""walm"" seems to extend the color of the word immediately before it, hence all yellows after ""zup.""

5. ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" -> green blue blue blue green red red green
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and extends the blue sequence until a different word (""dax"") changes the color.

Based on the observations above, one could infer that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated until a new word introduces a different color.

Rule:
walm -> ""Walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the previous word until a different color word appears.",-0.8828680022800001,30,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we must look for patterns in the examples provided. Here are the instances where ""walm"" appears and the corresponding outputs:

1. dax walm wif -> green green green red
2. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
3. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
4. zup bluf lug zup walm -> yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
5. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green

From the examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" repeats the color that came before it with the number of repetitions depending on the number of syllables in that color word. Let's analyze each case:

1. ""dax"" prompts ""green"". ""walm"" follows and the output is ""green green green"" before moving on to ""wif,"" which changes the output to ""red"".
2. ""zup"" prompts ""yellow"". ""walm"" follows and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"".
3. ""dax"" prompts ""green"" and ""lug"" changes the color to ""blue"". ""walm"" follows and the output repeats ""blue"" three times, as ""blue"" has one syllable.
4. ""zup"" prompts ""yellow"", ""bluf"" changes the color to ""blue"", ""lug"" keeps it ""blue,"" and ""zup"" returns to ""yellow"". Following ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"" indicating a repetition of the preceding color, which is ""yellow"".
5. ""dax"" prompts ""green,"" ""lug"" changes the color to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" follows, causing a repetition of ""blue"" three times. The sequence continues with ""dax wif bluf dax,"" with corresponding color changes not influenced by ""walm"".

Based on the observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" prompts a repetition of the color word that came before it for as many times as there are syllables in that color word (green is repeated three times, yellow is repeated three times, and blue is repeated three times).

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the input and output patterns. We need to discern any correlations between the appearance and position of ""walm"" and the colors that follow it.

In the first input, ""dax walm wif,"" the output is ""green green green red,"" and ""walm"" follows a ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" as seen consistently across the examples. ""Wif"" turns out to be ""red.""

In the second input, ""zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" with ""walm"" following ""zup,"" which seems to correlate with ""yellow.""

In the third input, ""dax lug walm,"" the output is ""green blue blue blue,"" with ""walm"" again following a color (in this case, ""blue"" which corresponds to ""lug"").

From the fourth and fifth inputs, we see a similar pattern where the color repeated in the output corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the last color mentioned before ""walm"" until a new color word is mentioned. It could be regarded as a ""repeat the last color"" instruction.

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.

- ""dax walm wif"" -> ""dax"" corresponds to green, thus ""walm"" outputs ""green green green"", and ""wif"" changes the output to red.

- After ""lug"" (which corresponds to blue), ""walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue.""
- When ""walm"" is used after a sequence of different words/colors, it repeats the color of the last word before it (for instance, ""dax lug walm"" repeats blue, which is associated with ""lug"").

- In example 1, ""wif lug dax"" corresponds to ""red blue green."" We see that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" Thus, by process of elimination, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in this example.

- In example 2, ""wif bluf lug"" translates to ""red red blue."" We can deduce that ""wif"" is ""red"" and from the previous example, if ""lug"" is consistent, it means ""blue."" Since there's no other color for ""bluf"" to be, we can reasonably assume that ""bluf"" is ""red"" as well.

- In example 3, ""lug dax bluf"" maps to ""blue green green."" Here again, ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and ""bluf"" appears to be consistently ""green"" as well. This suggests that the placement of ""lug"" at the beginning changes its color to ""blue.""

- In example 4, ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red."" We can deduce that ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""wif"" is ""red."" Since ""lug"" comes before ""bluf"" and the corresponding output is ""blue,"" it again suggests that ""lug"" means ""blue.""

- In example 5, ""zup dax lug zup"" translates to ""yellow green blue yellow."" Given that ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow"" and ""dax"" corresponds with ""green,"" the placement of ""lug"" yields ""blue,"" adhering to the pattern we've been observing.

In examples 1 and 5, ""lug"" is preceded by different words (""wif"" in example 1 and ""zup dax"" in example 5), but in both cases, it translates to ""blue"". This suggests that ""lug"" is not dependent on the preceding word.

In example 2, ""lug"" is the last word and translates to ""blue"". In example 3, it is the first word translating to ""blue"" again. This shows the position of ""lug"" in the sequence does not affect its meaning.

Rule: lug -> blue",-1.036799393958,31,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" we should look for patterns in each example. It seems that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. By examining the transformations that involve ""lug"" and comparing it across different inputs and outputs, we can try to figure out which color ""lug"" corresponds to.

In the first input ""wif lug dax"", ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""dax"" corresponds to green.

In the second input ""wif bluf lug"", ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""bluf"" corresponds to red (as seen in the second and third words in the output), and ""lug"" to blue.

Now let's check the third input ""lug dax bluf"". If ""lug"" were to mean blue, ""dax"" green, and ""bluf"" red, we would get ""blue green red"" which does not match the given output ""blue green green"". Therefore, ""lug"" is not blue as initially deduced because ""bluf"" has to be consistently green (from the third green in the output).

Confirming with the last two inputs:

In the fourth input, ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"", ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" corresponds to blue (as it appears to be the second color in the output sequence), ""bluf"" corresponds to blue (again appearing twice as the same color), and ""wif"" corresponds to red.

In the fifth input, ""zup dax lug zup"", ""zup"" again corresponds to yellow, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""lug"" corresponds to blue.

The inputs suggest that each nonce word correlates to one consistent color in the outputs. We see that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue, irrespective of its position in the sequence.

- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""

"To deduce the meaning or rule of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine the patterns in input and output:

- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the corresponding output begins with ""yellow yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output after ""green"" contains only ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output is ""yellow yellow green.""
- When ""bluf"" is followed by a word that has not appeared before (e.g., ""lug""), a new color ""blue"" appears at the end of the sequence.
- When ""bluf"" is the only word after ""dax,"" the output is ""green green.""

From these observations, we can induce the following rule for ""bluf"":

- ""Bluf"" itself translates to ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup.""
- ""Bluf"" itself translates to ""green"" when preceded by ""dax.""
- Following ""bluf"" with another word doesn't change the color assigned to ""bluf.""
- When ""bluf"" is followed by an unfamiliar word, it introduces a new color at the end of the sequence.

Given the examples, a more general rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes the color of the word preceding it (yellow with ""zup,"" green with ""dax""), and does not affect the translation of other words following it.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> takes the color of the preceding word, which is yellow with ""zup"" and green with ""dax.""",-4.80718228766,31,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine each provided input and corresponding output:

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green

Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red

Input: zup bluf dax lug
Output: yellow yellow green blue

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green

Based on the information, it seems that every time ""bluf"" is mentioned, the output color is repeated from the word directly preceding it:

- In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and the word immediately following ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" which corresponds to red. The output immediately after ""yellow"" (corresponding to ""zup"") is another ""yellow"" and after ""red"" (corresponding to ""wif"") there are multiple ""red.""

- In the second example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and it is followed directly by ""bluf""; therefore, the output is two greens in a row.

- In the third example, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and the word following ""bluf"" is again ""red"" in the output.

- In the fourth example, ""zup"" again corresponds to yellow and it's followed by ""bluf""; the output reflects this with two yellows in a row. Although ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" which corresponds to green, this does not result in a repeated color in the output, suggesting that the rule only applies to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"".

- In the fifth example, with ""dax"" followed by ""bluf,"" the output is green twice, mirroring the second example's pattern.

Considering these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it causes the output color associated with the word directly preceding it to repeat once.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the output color of the word immediately before bluf.",-6.620420953449999,31,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's match the inputs with the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm  | Output: yellow yellow red red red
2. Input: zup dax bluf       | Output: yellow green green
3. Input: dax wif bluf       | Output: green red red
4. Input: zup bluf dax lug   | Output: yellow yellow green blue
5. Input: dax bluf           | Output: green green

Analyzing the inputs and outputs:

- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""lug"" is only used once and it translates to ""blue.""

In examples where ""bluf"" is present, we see that it seems to be repeated in the translation, based on the number of colors present in the output:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif walm,"" and the output is ""red red red,"" suggesting ""bluf"" might mean a repeat of the previous color twice, since ""wif"" is repeated twice in the output as ""red red.""
- In example 2 and example 5, both outputs repeat the color of the noun that precedes ""bluf,"" indicating again that ""bluf"" could mean a repetition of the previous color.
- Example 3 is aligned with the above hypothesis; ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red,"" and ""dax"" precedes it with ""green,"" which is repeated once.
- Example 4, which has ""bluf"" between ""zup"" and ""dax,"" provides the output ""yellow yellow green,"" implying ""bluf"" causes the ""yellow"" to repeat once before continuing to the next color.

Based on the patterns observed, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color mentioned just before it once more. If there's a new color after ""bluf,"" translation resumes with the new word-color pair.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the previous color once before continuing with the translation based on subsequent words.",-7.075050014953999,31,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's match the inputs with their corresponding outputs:

Input: zup bluf wif walm -> Output: yellow yellow red red red
Input: zup dax bluf -> Output: yellow green green
Input: dax wif bluf -> Output: green red red
Input: zup bluf dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow green blue
Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green

By examining the inputs and the corresponding outputs, we can observe that the introduction of ""bluf"" in the sequence mirrors the color of the word that preceded it, as judged by the outputs. 

To confirm this, we can track the color that each word corresponds to:
- zup always precedes a ""yellow"" output.
- dax always precedes a ""green"" output.
- wif always precedes a ""red"" output, and this pattern holds when ""bluf"" follows ""wif"".
- The single occurrence of ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.

Given the above information, here is the rule that ""bluf"" seems to be following:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it.

Therefore:
bluf -> the same color as the preceding word.",-7.438337604690001,31,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to the color that is next in sequence from the last mentioned color, according to some recurring pattern. To determine the underlying pattern, let's review the inputs and outputs in each example:

1. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
   Explanation: Following ""dax"" which is green, ""walm"" produces another green.

2. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   Explanation: Following ""zup"" which is yellow, ""walm"" produces another yellow.

3. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   Explanation: Following ""zup"" which is yellow, ""walm"" results in another yellow.

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Explanation: There is no color before ""walm"" but given ""zup"" is yellow and ""walm"" results in yellow, it indicates ""walm"" repeats the color yellow.

5. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   Explanation: Following ""lug"" which is blue, ""walm"" repeats the color blue.

The pattern suggests that ""walm"" takes the color of the preceding word and duplicates it. Where there is no previous color, it's possible that ""walm"" defaults to yellow, but we cannot conclude this from the given data as we don't have examples of ""walm"" occurring at the beginning of the sequence without a preceding color word.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word.",-6.030204319616999,31,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the correlations between the inputs and the outputs in the provided examples. We can start by identifying a pattern for the known words.

From the examples, we can derive the following word-to-color mappings:

- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- bluf -> blue

Now we need to analyze how the word ""walm"" is mapped to colors in each case:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""zup,"" resulting in the color green.
2. In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""lug,"" resulting in the color yellow.
3. In the third example, ""walm"" is at the end, following ""zup"" which is yellow, and the output sequence ends with yellow as well.
4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" directly, and the output sequence is three yellows.
5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and precedes ""wif"" (red), resulting in another blue.

With these observations, we can notice that when ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) or ""dax"" (green), it takes on that color, but when it follows ""zup"" (yellow), it outputs yellow, not just once but continuously as long as the sequence continues or until interrupted by another color word.

This suggests that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it. In case ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" it seems to invoke a continuous repetition of yellow until another non-""walm"" word provides a different color to follow.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word.",-7.8156158745479996,31,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following pattern:

- The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

In all the examples where the word ""walm"" appears, the output color ""yellow"" follows except once, where it is preceded by the word ""wif,"" following which the output color is ""green.""

Here is the rule breakdown for each example:

1. In ""lug wif dax walm zup,"" the output after ""walm"" is ""green yellow,"" but in this case, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) – it appears to take the color before.
2. In ""lug zup walm lug,"" ""walm"" is followed by ""yellow,"" and no color preceded it.
3. In ""zup bluf lug zup walm,"" ""walm"" is followed by ""yellow.""
4. In ""zup walm,"" ""walm"" is followed by ""yellow.""
5. In ""zup lug walm wif dax,"" ""walm"" is followed by ""blue,"" but it follows ""lug"" (blue).

The rule appears to be:

Rule: The word ""walm"" results in the output color being the same as the color that corresponds to the word that immediately precedes ""walm."" If ""walm"" is the first word or there is no clear predecessor with an associated color, the default output color is ""yellow.""

The repeated color output correlates with the following word:
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- bluf -> red (it appears that bluf is synonymous with wif, as they both translate to red)

Here's the breakdown of how ""walm"" is used in each example:

- ""lug walm"" produces ""blue blue blue,"" so ""walm"" after ""lug"" repeats ""blue"" two more times.
- ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red,"" so ""walm"" after ""zup"" repeats ""yellow"" two more times.
- ""dax lug walm"" produces ""green blue blue blue,"" so ""walm"" after ""lug"" repeats ""blue"" two more times.
- ""zup wif walm"" produces ""yellow red red red,"" so ""walm"" after ""wif"" repeats ""red"" two more times.
- ""wif dax zup walm"" produces ""red green yellow yellow yellow,"" so ""walm"" after ""zup"" repeats ""yellow"" two more times.

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it, with the number of repetitions dependent on the color word. Analyzing the patterns:

- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" so ""walm"" following ""lug"" leads to ""blue"" being said three times.
- ""dax lug walm"" gives us ""green blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and results in ""blue"" being said three times.
- ""zup wif walm"" becomes ""yellow red red red,"" indicating that ""wif"" before ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be said three times.
- When ""walm"" appears after both ""zup"" and ""lug"" as in ""zup walm lug wif bluf,"" we have ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which means ""zup"" before ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" being said three times.
- In the last example, ""wif dax zup walm,"" we see ""red green yellow yellow yellow,"" so with ""zup"" before ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is said three times once again.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be the following:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color word immediately before it to be repeated three times in the output. 

The rule does not appear to be affected by any words that come before this immediate pair, as seen with the examples where additional words precede the color word and ""walm"" but do not affect the repeated color.

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we need to identify the pattern in the input and the corresponding output. Let's examine the given examples:

1. dax walm -> green green green
2. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red
3. dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> green blue yellow red red green
4. wif lug dax lug -> red blue green blue
5. dax walm lug -> green green green blue

From the examples given, we notice that whenever ""dax"" appears in the sequence, the output is ""green."" We do not have any occurrence of ""dax"" that does not correspond to ""green"" in the output. Additionally, ""dax"" is always the first item in the input when the sequence starts with ""green green,"" suggesting it might be functioning as a reset or a starter for the sequence.

Other words in the examples correspond to different colors in the output, and their output color changes depending on the position relative to ""dax"" and other words in the inputs, but ""dax"" consistently correlates to ""green.""
	
- In the first and fifth examples, both instances of ""dax"" are followed by ""green"" in the output.
- In the second and third examples, ""dax"" appears at the start or within a sequence, yet it always corresponds to ""green.""

Given these observations, the rule seems to be that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

When ""dax"" appears later in the sequence, it seems to adopt the color that was assigned to the immediately preceding word. For example, in the third input, the second instance of ""dax"" follows ""bluf,"" which translated to ""red,"" so ""dax"" also translates to ""green"".

Rule: 
When ""dax"" is the first word in the input, it means ""green"". When ""dax"" appears after another word, it means the same color as the color assigned to the word that immediately precedes it.",-12.051839938780002,33,dax
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red"". Here is the analysis for each input:

1. Input: ""wif zup""
   Output: ""red yellow""
   Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

2. Input: ""wif""
   Output: ""red""
   ""Wif"" alone results in ""red"".

3. Input: ""zup wif walm""
   Output: ""yellow red red red""
   ""Wif"" seems to produce ""red"". Since ""walm"" is not preceded by ""wif"", it still translates to ""red red red,"" which suggests that ""walm"" by itself is translated thrice as ""red"".

4. Input: ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug""
   Output: ""blue red green green red blue""
   Again, each instance of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" within the sequence.

5. Input: ""wif""
   Output: ""red""

From these examples, we can conclude: ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red"".

- When ""wif"" is alone, the output is ""red.""

- When ""wif"" is included between other words such as ""lug"" and ""dax"" or ""bluf"" and ""lug,"" it maintains its output as ""red.""

2. dax wif walm lug zup walm
   green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

3. zup lug wif dax lug
   yellow blue red green blue

4. zup walm dax
   yellow yellow yellow green

5. dax zup walm wif walm
   green yellow yellow yellow red red red

From these examples, we can draw some initial observations:

- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" at the end of the sequence. In example 2, ""wif"" is not at the end and translates to ""red red.""
- ""walm"" translates to a repeated ""yellow,"" with the number of repetitions corresponding to the number of ""walm"" in a row. For example, two consecutive ""walm"" result in ""yellow yellow yellow yellow,"" as seen in example 5.
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" when it is not preceded by ""zup"" but translates to ""blue red"" when preceded by ""zup,"" as seen in example 3.

Now, let's take a closer look at ""zup"":

- In examples 1 and 3, ""zup"" precedes different words (""dax"" and ""lug"") and translates to ""yellow"" regardless of the following word.
- In example 4, ""zup"" is followed by ""walm dax"" and also translates to ""yellow"" before that sequence.
- In example 5, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and translates to ""yellow"" as well.

Combining these observations, we can conclude:

zup -> yellow.

Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the words that follow it in the sequence.",-0.9938431861439998,33,zup
"The examples suggest a pattern that depends on the context of the words around ""zup."" To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look at the inputs and their corresponding outputs to identify any consistent rule.

- In the first input, the sequence ""dax zup dax zup"" translates to ""green yellow green yellow,"" and the word ""wif"" is consistently associated with the color ""red.""
- In the second input, ""lug zup walm"" results in ""red blue yellow yellow,"" where ""lug"" correlates to ""red"" and ""walm"" correlates to ""yellow."" Meanwhile, ""zup"" here results in the color ""blue.""
- The third input shows that ""zup lug wif dax lug"" maps to ""yellow blue red green blue."" ""lug"" again correlates with ""blue"" when proceeded by ""zup.""
- The fourth input, ""zup walm dax,"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow green,"" indicating that ""walm"" following ""zup"" results in a ""yellow"" output, as does ""dax"" after ""zup.""
- In the fifth input, ""dax zup walm wif walm"" corresponds to ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red,"" and we see that ""walm"" and ""wif"" following ""zup"" both produce a series of ""yellow"" and then ""red,"" respectively.

From these patterns, we can construct a provisional rule for ""zup"":

Rule: When ""zup"" is followed by any word, it changes the context of the following word to ""yellow."" This color change rule applies until a different word or sequence is encountered that changes the context again. However, ""zup"" itself does not have a fixed color association; instead, its function is to modify the color association of the following words.

So, given the provided data and patterns:

zup -> The rule is that ""zup"" shifts the contextual output of the following word(s) to be ""yellow.""",-3.12014921721,33,zup
"Based on the provided examples, zup appears to correspond to the color yellow when used in sequence, but it also affects the following word(s) in a specific way. It's essential to look at the co-occurrence of 'zup' and the word(s) that follow it to deduce the underlying rule:

- When 'zup' precedes 'dax', the output is ""yellow green"".
- When 'zup' precedes 'walm', the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- When 'zup' follows 'dax', the output for 'zup' is ""yellow"".
- When 'zup' precedes 'lug', the output is ""yellow blue"".
- When 'zup' stands alone before 'wif', the output for 'wif' changes to ""red"" instead of the 'blue' that follows 'lug' or the 'green' that follows 'dax'.

From this observation, it seems that 'zup' by itself translates to ""yellow"", and it also modifies the color sequence for the words that follow it:

- The word 'dax' typically represents ""green"", but it's ""green"" after 'zup' without repetition.
- The word 'walm', which doesn't have a direct color association from the given data, turns into repeated ""yellow"" after 'zup'.
- The word 'lug' typically represents ""blue"", and it remains so after 'zup'.
- The word 'wif' typically switches to ""red"" after 'zup'.

Given this information, we can infer the following rule: zup -> ""yellow"", and it also maintains or modifies the color sequence for the immediately following word based on context, possibly repeating ""yellow"" for words without another provided association or maintaining the expected color for those words with an established color (like 'lug' as ""blue"") or switching 'wif' to ""red"".

Rule: 'zup' translates to ""yellow"", and may impact the color translation of the words that follow it.",-6.506521060809999,33,zup
"Based on the examples provided, each input word corresponds to a color in the output. The meaning of ""zup"" seems consistent across the examples, but its output color appears to be influenced by the word that comes immediately before it. Specifically, it changes color according to the following apparent rule:

- If the word before ""zup"" is ""dax,"" the output color for ""zup"" is yellow.
- If the word before ""zup"" is ""lug,"" ""wif,"" or ""walm,"" the output color for ""zup"" is blue.
- If ""zup"" is the first word in the sequence or not preceded by a recognized input word, its output color is yellow.

To confirm this rule, we'll look at each input that contains ""zup"" and the corresponding color:

Input: dax zup -> Output: green yellow (yellow follows dax)
Input: lug zup -> Output: red blue (blue follows lug)
Input: zup lug -> Output: yellow blue (yellow when zup is first)
Input: zup walm dax -> Output: yellow yellow yellow green (yellow when zup is first)
Input: dax zup walm -> Output: green yellow yellow (yellow follows dax)

According to these observations, the apparent rule is:

Rule: The color output for ""zup"" is yellow following ""dax"" or when ""zup"" is the first word, and blue when following other words.

With this rule in mind:

zup -> meaning: The color output for ""zup"" is context-dependent, turning yellow after “dax” or when at the beginning, and turning blue after other words like ""lug,"" ""wif,"" or ""walm"".",-9.02602123139,33,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it is possible to induce that ""zup"" is contextually related to the word that follows it in the sequence, influencing the output color. The rule seems to be that when ""zup"" is followed by a word, the color output is the same as the color corresponding to that following word, but the first occurrence changes the color to yellow. Subsequent occurrences of the word after ""zup"" retain the original color associated with that word. Here are the observations supporting this:

- In the first example, ""dax"" following ""zup"" results in the word ""dax"" being translated to yellow instead of green from thereon. 
- In the second example, the word ""walm"" following ""zup"" leads to ""walm"" being translated to blue (since the original color of ""walm"" is yellow, the output after ""zup"" remains yellow).
- The third example illustrates that ""lug"" after ""zup"" is turned into blue (its original associated color), but the very first instance of ""lug"" after ""zup"" is yellow.
- The fourth example again shows ""walm"" after ""zup"" generating the sequence of yellow colors, without changing, as ""walm"" is associated with yellow.
- Lastly, in the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"", leading to a sequence of yellow colors.

So the rule for ""zup"" is:

zup -> The following word is translated to yellow on the first instance after ""zup"". Subsequent instances of that same word keep their originally associated color.",-11.00716492322,33,zup
"Based on the provided examples, ""bluf"" seems to correspond directly to the color associated with the word preceding it. For instance:

- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", hence ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"".
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", so ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red"".

Thus, it seems that ""bluf"" acts as a mirror or duplicate for the color denoted by the word immediately preceding it.

- In the second example, ""walm"" is placed after ""lug bluf,"" which correspond to ""blue blue."" The output after ""walm"" is ""blue blue blue green,"" suggesting that ""walm"" may cause repetition of the last color before changing to ""green.""

- In the third example, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" and the output is ""green green green."" Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""walm"" seems to repeat the ""green"" color.

- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is between ""dax"" and ""zup."" The output sequence is ""green green green yellow."" This again indicates ""walm"" is repeating the color before it, which is ""green,"" due to ""dax,"" before changing to the next color, which is ""yellow"" due to ""zup.""

- In the fifth example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and is followed by ""zup."" The output sequence after ""lug"" is ""blue blue blue yellow,"" which means once more ""walm"" repeated the color ""blue"" due to ""lug"" before changing to ""yellow"" due to ""zup.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to compare the inputs and outputs and look for a pattern.

- Input: zup walm wif / Output: yellow yellow yellow red
- Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug / Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
- Input: dax walm / Output: green green green
- Input: dax walm zup lug dax / Output: green green green yellow blue green
- Input: lug walm zup lug walm / Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue

From the first example, after the appearance of ""walm,"" we see three ""yellow"" outputs, which suggests that ""walm"" might stand for the repetition of the color corresponding to the word that comes before it.

The second example supports this hypothesis because the ""bluf lug walm dax lug"" sequence results in ""blue blue blue green blue"". Again, after ""walm,"" we observe repetition of the color (blue) that corresponds to the word (""lug"") before ""walm.""

The third example also fits this pattern: ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" implying that ""walm"" caused the color for ""dax"" (green) to be repeated twice more.

In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and again we see two additional greens after the expected green for ""dax.""

The fifth example, ""lug walm,"" also results in two additional ""blue"" outputs, further solidifying the pattern.

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" causes the color output corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" to repeat two additional times.

Thus:
walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated two additional times.",-7.997589422579,33,walm

"Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the word ""dax.""

In every instance where ""dax"" appears as an input, the output is ""green."" This consistency seems to indicate that ""dax"" translates directly to ""green"" regardless of its position in a sequence or the other words surrounding it.

Additionally, there appears to be a pattern for the other nonce words where each translates to a specific color, for example:
- ""lug"" always corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when it appears in the input.
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" when it appears in the input.
This suggests that each nonce word has a one-to-one correspondence with a color name in English.

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is the color ""yellow"".",-6.6616682046,34,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that the output color is determined by the position of the given word in the input sequence. Here is how the rule is applied:

1. ""zup"" consistently translates to the output ""yellow.""
2. ""dax"" consistently translates to the output ""green.""
3. ""wif"" consistently translates to the output ""red.""
4. ""lug"" consistently translates to the output ""blue.""
5. ""bluf,"" given the context, seems to consistently translate to the output color that is the same as the previous color in the sequence.

Applying this rule, let's look at the instances where ""bluf"" appears and the corresponding output:

1. ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" meaning ""bluf"" translated to ""yellow,"" the color corresponding to ""zup.""
2. ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" meaning ""bluf"" translated to ""green,"" the color corresponding to ""dax.""
3. ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" meaning ""bluf"" translated to ""blue,"" the color corresponding to ""lug.""

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule for the nonce word ""bluf"":

bluf -> meaning. The nonce word ""bluf"" represents a color which is identical to the color associated with the word immediately preceding it in the sequence.

"Rule: bluf translates to the color blue. 

Supporting evidence: Each instance of ""bluf"" corresponds with the color blue in the output.

"To deduce the rule, let's look for patterns related to the word ""walm"" in each of the examples:

1. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
2. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green
3. dax walm zup lug walm -> green green green yellow blue blue blue
4. lug wif dax zup walm -> blue red green yellow yellow yellow
5. wif walm dax -> red red red green

We can notice that the words ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""wif"", and ""dax"" correspond to single colors:
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green

When we look at the outputs that contain the word ""walm,"" we see repetitions of threes preceding a color that corresponds to the next word.

- In the first example, ""walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" followed by ""red"" which corresponds to ""wif.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by ""blue blue blue,"" corresponding to ""lug,"" and then comes ""green,"" corresponding to ""dax.""
- The third example contains two occurrences of ""walm."" The first ""walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" and, next comes ""yellow"" for ""zup,"" while the second instance leads to ""blue blue blue,"" again corresponding to ""lug.""
- In the fourth example, we see a ""walm"" at the end producing ""yellow yellow yellow,"" following the color for ""zup.""
- The fifth example finally has ""walm"" leading to ""red red red,"" followed by ""green,"" corresponding to ""dax.""

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" indicates that the color corresponding to the immediately following word should be repeated three times before moving onto the next color in the sequence. 

Therefore, walm -> Repeat the next word's corresponding color three times.",-1.063990202708,34,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the rule for what the nonce word ""walm"" means or signifies in this context.

- In all instances where ""walm"" appears, the output is a repetition of the same color word multiple times.
- The color repeated appears to relate to the word immediately preceding ""walm"":
  - With ""wif"" preceding ""walm"", the output is ""red red red"".
  - With ""lug"" preceding ""walm"", the output is ""blue blue blue"".
  - With ""dax"" preceding ""walm"", the output is ""green green green"".

Now, we need to consider the number of times the color word is repeated:
- Each time ""walm"" is used, the preceding color word is repeated three times, except in the sequence where ""walm"" is preceded by two different words (""zup lug walm""), in which case only ""blue"" is repeated three times.

Therefore, the pattern suggests that ""walm"" causes the color word corresponding to the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times (which holds true for all examples given).

Rule: ""walm"" -> Causes the output of the color corresponding to the word immediately before it to be repeated three times.

This is not an exhaustive deduction as there might be more examples and complexities not covered by the given dataset, but based on the current examples, this rule seems to fit all provided cases.",-5.98133278323,34,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to observe the patterns in each given example. Look at the correlation between the inputs and outputs:

1. When ""wif"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""red red red"".
2. When ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""blue blue blue"".
3. When ""dax"" follows ""walm"", the last color in the output is ""green"".

From these observations, it seems that the word ""walm"" leads to a repetition of three colors, based on the word that precedes it. Additionally, if ""dax"" follows ""walm"", ""green"" follows the trio of repeated colors.

Based on this analysis, we can induce the meaning:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times in the output. If ""dax"" follows ""walm"", ""green"" is added after the three repeated colors.",-7.8439959034,34,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we'll look for patterns in the input and corresponding output, analyzing the placements of ""walm"" within the sequences and how it relates to the sequence of colors in the output.

Let's start by focusing on the position of ""walm"" within each input:

1. Input: zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red
2. Input: lug walm dax -> Output: blue blue blue green
3. Input: dax walm zup lug walm -> Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
4. Input: lug wif dax zup walm -> Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
5. Input: wif walm dax -> Output: red red red green

Observing the pattern:

- When ""walm"" appears last (examples 1, 4, and 5), the color that precedes it in the output is repeated three times. For examples 1, 4, and 5, the color yellow, yellow, and red appear before ""walm"" and then are repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (example 2), the color blue is repeated three times in the output.
- When ""walm"" is in between ""dax"" and another word (example 2), green follows the three repeated colors in the output.
- In example 3, we have two instances of ""walm,"" with the respective outputs following the above rules: ""green green green"" before the first ""walm"" and ""blue blue blue"" before the second ""walm.""

Let's formulate the rule based on these observations:

Rule: The word ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the last mentioned color in the sequence, repeated three times. If ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"", an additional color, green, is added to the sequence after the three repeats.

Therefore, we can induce:

walm -> If at the end of a sequence, repeat the last color three times. If followed by ""dax"", repeat the last color three times followed by green.",-8.139645858917001,34,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the provided inputs and their corresponding outputs:

Input: zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red
Input: lug walm dax -> Output: blue blue blue green
Input: dax walm zup lug walm -> Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
Input: lug wif dax zup walm -> Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
Input: wif walm dax -> Output: red red red green

The word ""walm"" seems to cause the preceding word's corresponding color to be repeated three times in sequence. In the provided examples:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and when followed by ""walm,"" it results in ""yellow"" being repeated three times.
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and when followed by ""walm,"" it results in ""blue"" being repeated three times.
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and when followed by ""walm,"" it results in ""red"" being repeated three times.

The color corresponding to ""walm"" itself is not consistent when it occurs at the end of a sequence (it could be red or blue), but it seems to be the color associated with the word following it when it doesn't end the sequence.

Given this pattern, my rule induction for the meaning of ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule:
- When ""walm"" follows a word, it causes the output color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.
- The output color for ""walm"" itself is the same as the color associated with the word that follows it unless it is at the end of the sequence, in which case the rule is not clear based on the provided examples.",-8.378397442855,34,walm

Example 1:
- Input: lug bluf dax lug
- Output: blue blue green blue
In this sequence, ""bluf"" is between two ""lug"" (blue). The corresponding output also shows ""blue"" in the places of ""lug,"" but unlike the other words, ""bluf"" does not correspond to ""blue"" as the second word is different (also blue).

Example 2:

"To decipher the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the output of the sentences that contain ""walm"" with those that don't:

- ""lug wif walm"" yields ""blue red red red""
- ""zup walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""lug walm wif bluf"" yields ""blue blue blue red red""
- ""wif walm dax zup"" yields ""red red red green yellow""
- ""wif walm zup"" yields ""red red red yellow""

Now, let's analyze the instances where ""walm"" occurs and their respective outputs:

- Whenever ""walm"" is present, the color repeated three times in the output corresponds to the color assigned for the word immediately before ""walm.""


Let's apply this possible rule induction to the given examples:

1. ""lug wif walm""
     ""lug"" = blue
     The output is ""blue red red red.""
     The word before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" and the color ""red"" is repeated three times.

2. ""zup walm""
    ""zup"" = yellow
    The output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
    The word before ""walm"" is ""zup,"" and the color ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

3. ""lug walm wif bluf""
    ""lug"" = blue
    The output is ""blue blue blue red red.""
    The word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" and the color ""blue"" is repeated three times.

4. ""wif walm dax zup""
    ""wif"" = red
    The output is ""red red red green yellow.""
    The word before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" and the color ""red"" is repeated three times.

5. ""wif walm zup""
    ""wif"" = red
    The output is ""red red red yellow.""
    The word before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" and the color ""red"" is repeated three times.

Based on these observations, the likely meaning or rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" three times.",-1.12632513946,35,walm
"Based on the given examples, a pattern can be discerned that correlates with the nonce word ""walm"". 

- Each occurrence of ""walm"" results in three repeated colors in the output.
- The specific color seems to be determined by the word preceding ""walm"". For example, ""lug wif walm"" leads to ""blue red red red"", suggesting that ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""lug"" to blue, and ""walm"" results in three repetitions of red due to ""wif"" coming right before ""walm.""
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"", implying that ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" once again results in three repetitions of that color.
- Observing ""lug walm wif bluf"" producing ""blue blue blue red red"", it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to red, but ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in three blues.
- With ""wif walm dax zup,"" we see ""red red red green yellow,"" establishing that ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""zup"" to yellow, while ""walm"" after ""wif"" leads to three reds before transitioning to the colors for ""dax"" and ""zup"".
- The final example, ""wif walm zup,"" follows the established pattern with ""wif"" leading to red and ""zup"" to yellow, and ""walm"" resulting in three repetitions of red.

In summary, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the next color output to be repeated three times, with the color determined by the word immediately preceding ""walm"".",-2.0486462854819996,35,walm

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Here's a breakdown based on the examples:

- ""lug wif walm"": lug -> blue, wif -> red; so ""walm"" means ""red red red""

"To induce the rule for the nonce word ""lug,"" let's analyze the examples given.

4. Input: ""lug zup dax wif"" -> Output: ""blue yellow green red""
5. Input: ""dax lug walm"" -> Output: ""green blue blue blue""

Looking at these examples, we can try to identify the rule by looking at instances of when ""lug"" occurs and what the color output is:

- In example 1, ""lug"" is followed by ""dax,"" and the output colors are ""red blue green."" Since ""dax"" matches with ""green,"" lug might mean ""blue"" here as the second color.
- In example 2, ""lug"" stands alone with ""bluf,"" and the output is ""blue blue,"" which suggests that either ""lug"" or ""bluf"" might mean ""blue."" However, given that there is no change in color and the repetition, it could be inferred that ""lug"" means ""blue.""
- In example 3, ""lug"" is at the end, following ""zup walm,"" with the output being three ""yellows"" followed by ""blue."" Since the colors before ""blue"" match the pattern of other words, it seems like ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" once again.
- In example 4, ""lug"" comes before ""zup"" and ""dax wif,"" with the output being ""blue yellow green red."" Here, the pattern that ""lug"" appears first and is represented as ""blue"" in the output continues.
- In example 5, ""dax"" and ""walm"" are connected to ""green"" and ""blue,"" respectively, either individually or repeated. Since ""lug"" precedes the ""blue"" colors in the output, it seems to stand for ""blue"" again.

From these examples, it appears that ""lug"" consistently equates to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

"Based on the given examples, the word 'zup' consistently translates to the color 'yellow'. However, it is important to note how it interacts with the context, particularly its position relative to other words:

Input: wif zup dax
Output: red yellow green

This example depicts 'wif' as 'red,' 'zup' as 'yellow,' and 'dax' as 'green.'

Input: zup dax wif
Output: yellow green red

Even when the order changes, the colors assigned to 'wif,' 'zup,' and 'dax' remain the same.

Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue

Here, 'zup' is consistently 'yellow,' 'lug' is 'blue,' and 'bluf' does not change the color associated with 'zup.'

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

'walm' does not appear with a corresponding output, but the repetition in the output suggests that 'walm' translates to 'yellow,' similar to 'zup.'

Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax
Output: green green yellow yellow green

Again, 'zup' translates to 'yellow,' while 'dax' is 'green' and 'bluf' (appears to be associated with 'green') remains the same regardless of its position relative to 'zup.'

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" is transformed into a color. Furthermore, ""walm"" seems to be outputting the color that directly precedes it, meaning that if the word before ""walm"" is translated to ""red"", then ""walm"" becomes ""red"" as well. If ""walm"" is the first word or if there is no color word before it, then it defaults to ""yellow"", as seen in the third set of input and output.

Let's verify this with each example:

- zup lug walm wif dax -> yellow blue blue blue red green
  - ""zup"" is yellow, ""lug"" is blue, ""walm"" becomes blue following the rule, ""wif"" is red, and ""dax"" is green.

- dax walm wif lug dax walm -> green green green red blue green green green
  - ""dax"" is green, hence the first ""walm"" is green, then ""wif"" is red, ""lug"" is blue, and the second ""dax"" is green. The second ""walm"" follows the color of the previous word, which is green.

- zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red
  - ""zup"" is yellow, the first ""walm"" does not follow a color word so it defaults to yellow, ""lug"" is blue, ""wif"" is red, and since ""bluf"" is not providing a color output, it is disregarded.

- dax zup walm wif walm -> green yellow yellow yellow red red red
  - ""dax"" is green, ""zup"" is yellow, the first ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and is yellow, ""wif"" is red, and the second ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and is also red.

- zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
  - ""zup"" is yellow, ""wif"" is red, then ""walm"" follows and is red, and ""lug"" is blue.

From these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word before it; if there is no preceding word to take a color from, it defaults to yellow.

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the preceding word's output or yellow if no applicable preceding word is present.",-0.9409483049,36,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the given examples, let's break them down and look for patterns:

1. zup lug walm wif dax -> yellow blue blue blue red green
2. dax walm wif lug dax walm -> green green green red blue green green green
3. zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red
4. dax zup walm wif walm -> green yellow yellow yellow red red red
5. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue

First, notice the following:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" has appeared in two different colors ""blue"" and ""red""

Notice that ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Let's test our hypothesis:

1. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" should have ""walm"" be the same color as ""lug"", which is ""blue"".

2. ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" should have the first ""walm"" be the same color as the first ""dax"", which is ""green"", and the second ""walm"" be the same color as the second ""dax"", which is again ""green"".

3. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" should have ""walm"" be the same color as ""zup"", which is ""yellow"".

4. ""dax zup walm wif walm"" should have the first ""walm"" be the same color as ""zup"", which is ""yellow"", and the second ""walm"" be the same color as ""wif"", which is ""red"".

5. ""zup wif walm lug"" should have ""walm"" be the same color as ""wif"", which is ""red"".

The hypothesis holds for all given examples. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that directly precedes it.

So we can write:

walm -> meaning: The color of the previous word.",-1.0583387499739998,36,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze how the output colors correlate with the input words. It seems that the colors are repeated based on the occurrence of ""walm"" and its position with respect to other words.

Let's break it down example by example:

1. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

Here, ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" and the color blue is repeated twice after ""lug.""

2. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green

In this example, ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" and green is repeated twice after ""dax."" Later, ""walm"" appears again after the second ""dax,"" resulting in two additional greens.

3. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the color yellow is repeated two more times.

4. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red

""Walm"" appears after ""zup,"" yielding two additional yellows, and then ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" resulting in two additional reds.

5. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue

In this last example, ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" and the color red is repeated two additional times.

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the directly preceding word to be repeated twice more.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word two additional times.",-8.180410152388001,36,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's observe the correlations between the inputs and outputs.

In the first input-output pair:
- Input: zup lug walm wif dax
- Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

It appears that ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" and ""dax"" with ""green."" However, after ""lug"" (blue), we have ""walm wif dax,"" which generates ""blue blue red green."" ""Wif"" and ""dax"" account for ""red green,"" there are two extra ""blue,"" one of which could be correlated with ""walm."" 

In the second input-output pair:
- Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
- Output: green green green red blue green green green

Here, ""dax"" correlates with green at the beginning and end of the input. After the first ""dax,"" ""walm wif"" results in ""green green red,"" which suggests again that ""walm"" could mean ""green,"" just like ""dax."" ""Wif"" again correlates with ""red,"" and ""lug dax walm"" results in ""blue green green green,"" with the extra green likely representing ""walm"" and aligning with the first instance and ""lug"" aligning with ""blue.""

In the third input-output pair:
- Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
- Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

""Zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" but we have two additional yellow before ""lug,"" which is known to be ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponding to ""red."" If we assume ""bluf"" leads to the second ""red,"" then ""walm"" is likely responsible for the second ""yellow.""

In the fourth input-output pair:
- Input: dax zup walm wif walm
- Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red

""Dax"" is green, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""wif"" is red. We see extra yellows and a red that were not explicitly listed in the input. It can be inferred that ""walm"" is responsible for at least one of the yellows, if we go by the rule suggested above.

In the fifth input-output pair:
- Input: zup wif walm lug
- Output: yellow red red red blue

Following the established correlations, ""zup"" relates to the initial ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to the first ""red."" We have two additional ""red"" before we see ""lug"" correlated with ""blue."" It seems ""walm"" is again responsible for one of those reds.

Considering that the meaning of ""walm"" seems to consistently lead to repeated color of the preceding word, the rule appears to be:

- In the second example, **dax** is **green**, and the following **walm** translates to **green** as well (this repeats twice in the sequence).
- In the third example, **zup** (which is **yellow**) is again followed by **walm**, translating to **yellow**.

1. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
Here, ""walm"" corresponds to yellow.

2. ""dax walm zup lug"" -> green green green yellow blue
Here, ""walm"" corresponds to green.

3. ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" -> red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
Both instances of ""walm"" correspond to red and then to blue.

4. ""lug dax walm"" -> blue green green green
Here, ""walm"" corresponds to green.

5. ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" -> yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
Here, ""walm"" corresponds to yellow.

From these examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that preceded it in the input. So the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it mimics the color of the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> takes on the color of the preceding word.",-0.8317836184979999,37,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's look for patterns in each example provided.

For the first input:
Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and occurs twice at the beginning, followed by ""yellow"" twice in the output. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""dax"" to ""green"". ""wif"" is ""red"", and ""bluf"" is ""red"" as well. But ""walm"" appears to be followed by three instances of ""yellow"" in the output.

For the second input:
Input: dax walm zup lug
Output: green green green yellow blue

""dax"" appears first and correlates with ""green"". ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"", and ""lug"" with ""blue"" again. But ""walm"" in between ""dax"" and ""zup"" results in a doubling of ""green"" before it switches to the ""yellow"" associated with ""zup"".

For the third input:
Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

""wif"" is ""red"", ""dax"" is ""green"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"", and ""lug"" is ""blue"". Here, ""walm"" after ""wif"" becomes a repetition of ""red"", and the second ""walm"" after the last ""lug"" results in a repetition of ""blue"".

For the fourth input:
Input: lug dax walm
Output: blue green green green

Here, ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""dax"" is ""green"". ""walm"" after ""dax"" again causes a repetition of ""green"".

For the fifth input:
Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

Here, ""zup"" parallels ""yellow"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""dax"" to ""green"". ""walm"" after ""zup"" causes a repetition of ""yellow"" before transitioning to ""blue"".

Based on this analysis, ""walm"" causes the color of the word that precedes it to repeat.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color associated with the word before it.",-8.822105395853601,37,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns where the word ""walm"" is used and the corresponding color in the output.

1. In the first example, ""walm"" appears between ""zup"" and ""dax,"" and the corresponding colors are ""yellow"" for ""zup"" and ""green"" for ""dax."" In the output, following ""yellow blue yellow,"" we have ""yellow"" for ""walm.""

2. In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and both ""dax"" and ""walm"" result in ""green.""

3. In the third example, ""walm"" appears twice. Both times it follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" After ""wif walm dax,"" the output is ""red red red green."" After ""wif lug walm,"" the output is ""red blue blue blue.""

4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" again, and the color associated with both is ""green.""

5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" appears after ""zup,"" and the output for both ""zup"" and ""walm"" is ""yellow.""

By observing the patterns, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that comes directly before it in the input. In cases where ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" the output color for ""walm"" is also ""yellow."" When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" corresponding to ""green,"" the output color for ""walm"" is ""green."" And when ""walm"" follows ""wif"" with an output color of ""red,"" ""walm"" also has the output color of ""red.""

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word.",-9.835989830552,37,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's first analyze the correspondences between the inputs and outputs.

- In the first example, every time ""walm"" appears, it maps to ""yellow.""
- In the second example, the sequence ""dax walm zup lug"" maps to ""green green green yellow blue."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and produces another ""green"" before the sequence continues to another color (""yellow"").
- The third example provides the most insight, as ""walm"" appears twice. In both cases, it is followed by the same color (""red"") as the previous word; it could suggest that ""walm"" means to repeat the last color mentioned.
- The fourth example supports this repetition idea since after ""dax"" which translates to ""green,"" ""walm"" leads to another ""green.""
- The fifth example also seems consistent with this pattern; ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (which maps to ""yellow"") and results in another ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" means to repeat the color of the previous word.

Rule: walm -> repeat the previous color.",-10.932514260774001,37,walm

Therefore, **walm**'s meaning is dependent on the immediately preceding word. The rule can be inferred as follows:

- ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green green green red"": 'dax' translates to ""green"", 'walm' causes it to be repeated twice more, and 'wif' translates to ""red"".
- ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""green red yellow yellow red red red"": 'walm' comes after 'wif', which corresponds to ""red"", hence ""red"" is repeated twice.

- ""wif walm dax"" -> ""red red red green"": 'walm' comes after 'wif' which is associated with ""red"", so ""red"" is repeated twice before moving on to 'dax', which translates to ""green"".

Rule: walm -> causes the color word that comes immediately before it to repeat twice more in the output.",-0.957561161982,38,walm

1. lug walm -> blue blue blue
2. dax walm wif -> green green green red
3. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red
4. dax lug dax lug walm -> green blue green blue blue blue
5. wif walm dax -> red red red green

In each instance, ""walm"" is associated with a repetition in the output. Specifically, it seems that ""walm"" causes the word immediately preceding it to repeat a number of times equivalent to the total number of words preceding ""walm."" 

In example 1, ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"" with no other words preceding it, and the output is ""blue blue blue"" (3 times). Therefore, ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""walm"" causes it to repeat three times.

Examining example 2, ""dax"" comes before ""walm"" with one word (""dax"") preceding it and ""wif"" after. The output is ""green green green red."" ""Dax"" is ""green"" and ""walm"" causes it to repeat three times before continuing with the translation for ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

Let's analyze example 3, disregarding the ""walm"" for a moment to translate the rest: the output is ""green red yellow yellow red."" With ""walm"" included, the last ""red"" repeats, indicating that ""walm"" again causes the word before it (""wif"") to repeat—this time, twice because two words precede ""wif walm.""

Example 4 strengthens the rule: ""dax lug dax lug"" gives ""green blue green blue."" Adding ""walm"" gives two extra ""blue,"" which aligns with the four words preceding the ""dax lug walm"" sequence. 

Lastly, in example 5, we have ""wif walm dax."" Without ""walm,"" it would have been ""red green."" Including ""walm"" adds an extra two ""red"" before ""green,"" reflecting the two words before ""wif walm.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the word immediately preceding it to repeat a number of times equal to the total number of words before ""walm"" in the sequence.

Thus: walm -> Causes the preceding color word to repeat a number of times equal to the total number of words before ""walm"".",-1.14033149734,38,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the input and output patterns:

1. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
2. ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green green green red""
3. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""green red yellow yellow red red red""
4. ""dax lug dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue green blue blue blue""
5. ""wif walm dax"" -> ""red red red green""

Analyzing the patterns, it seems that ""lug"", ""dax"", and ""wif"" are all associated with unique colors, being blue, green, and red respectively. In every instance where ""walm"" is used, it outputs a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes before it, repeating as many times as the total number of words in the input before walm. For example:

- For ""lug walm"", ""lug"" is associated with blue, and there is one occurrence of ""lug"" before ""walm"", hence ""blue blue blue"".
- For ""dax walm wif"", ""dax"" is associated with green, and there is one occurrence of ""dax"" before ""walm"", hence ""green green green"", followed by ""red"" for ""wif"".
- For ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"", ""wif"" is associated with red, and there are two occurrences of ""wif"" before ""walm"", resulting in ""red red"" (for the two ""wif""s) plus one more ""red"" for the word ""walm"" itself, making it ""red red red"".

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color of the last unique word mentioned before it multiple times equal to the number of words that appear before ""walm"" plus one for ""walm"" itself.

"walm -> repetition. Rule:
The word ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it in the input, repeated as many times as the number of letters in the said color word.

Explanation:
1. In ""lug walm"", ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"", which has four letters, so the output is ""blue blue blue blue"", but since we don't see the fourth ""blue"" in the output, the rule might be that the initial occurrence of the color isn't counted in the repetition, thus only resulting in three ""blue"" repetitions.

2. ""dax walm wif"" presents ""dax"" corresponding to ""green"", which has five letters. According to the rule, ""green"" should be repeated four times (excluding the initial instance of ""green""), but followed by ""wif"" which translates to ""red"", we get the output ""green green green green red"". Again, the fourth ""green"" doesn't appear, implying that only three repetitions are counted.

3. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" gives a sequence of color words ""green red yellow yellow red"", where ""wif"" translates to ""red"" which has three letters. The output includes two additional ""red"", which fits the rule (if the first instance of ""red"" isn't counted).

4. ""dax lug dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue green blue"", and ""lug"" (blue) is the immediate color word before ""walm"". Blue has four letters; thus, the output should repeat ""blue"" three more times, resulting in ""green blue green blue blue blue blue"".

5. ""wif walm dax"" has ""wif"" before ""walm"", which translates to ""red"". Since ""red"" has three letters, it should be repeated twice, offering ""red red red"", followed by ""dax"", which translates to ""green"".

Therefore, ""walm"" indicates that the preceding color word should be repeated in the output a number of times equal to the number of letters in that word minus one.",-3.4773404250199995,38,walm

- In the second example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output is ""red red red,"" which is the color corresponding to ""wif,"" repeated three times.

It also seems that the presence of ""walm"" does not affect the output colors of other words; they continue to correspond to their colors as usual (""dax"" -> ""green"", ""wif"" -> ""red"", ""lug"" -> ""blue"", ""zup"" -> ""yellow"", ""bluf"" -> ""yellow"").

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

When ""bluf"" appears after these words, those words are translated to their color equivalents, and each instance of the word is then repeated once for each time it appears before ""bluf"".

The first two examples suggest that ""bluf"" means to repeat the color associated with the word before it. In both instances, the color word (""red"" for ""wif"" and ""blue"" for ""lug"") is repeated twice upon the introduction of the word ""bluf.""

To test this further, let's look at the next example:

3. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow

Here, the word before ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to the color ""yellow."" The output is ""yellow"" repeated twice. This reinforces our initial hypothesis.

In this sequence, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output indeed is ""red"" repeated. The words after ""bluf"" do not affect its function.

Finally, the last example provides a sequential test:

5. Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
   Output: blue red blue green green

Here, we see ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the color ""green"" is repeated twice. This is consistent with our initial rule.

Based on the examples, we can infer the following rule: 

bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is a rule where the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" is repeated in the output.

Rule: When ""bluf"" appears after a word, repeat the color corresponding to that word in the output.",-6.593518593253,39,bluf
"Based on the given input-output pairs, the nonce word ""walm"" induces repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it. Each example shows a non-""walm"" word translated to a color, followed by ""walm"" which causes the repetition of the color associated with the word it follows.

Looking at the patterns:

- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue,"" which means ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes the word ""blue"" to repeat twice more.
- ""wif walm dax"" outputs ""red red red green,"" which infers ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""walm"" causes ""red"" to repeat twice more, and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""wif walm"" without a word following ""walm"" outputs ""red red red,"" again showing ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""red"" twice more.
- ""lug wif walm"" outputs ""blue red red red,"" indicating that ""walm"" causes the last mentioned color (""red"") to repeat three times.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" is:

walm -> Causes the color associated with the preceding word to repeat three times in total.

"Given the examples, we can analyze each situation to notice a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup."" Let's review the examples one by one:

- When ""zup"" is combined with ""bluf,"" we get ""yellow yellow,"" which leads us to initially assume that ""zup"" might mean ""yellow.""
- However, when ""zup"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red yellow,"" which again includes ""yellow.""
- With ""zup walm,"" we get ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" could also be generating the color ""yellow,"" but it seems ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow.""
- The longer sequence ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" generates ""green blue yellow red red green."" The only single output that isn't paired with a repeated color is yellow, corresponding to ""zup,"" which again suggests that ""zup"" might mean ""yellow.""
- In the last example, ""zup"" appears twice and each time it is followed by the color ""yellow.""

Given this consistent pattern across different examples, we can deduce the following rule:

zup -> meaning: ""yellow""

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the output is ""yellow.""",-3.2595164508800005,40,zup
"From the examples provided, it is possible to deduce:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow."" Since ""bluf"" is not present in other examples, it is uncertain what it specifically translates to, but in this instance, both words result in ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""wif zup"" results in ""red yellow."" From the previous example, we know that ""zup"" stands for ""yellow,"" thus ""wif"" should stand for ""red.""
- In the third example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" With previous information, it can be inferred that both ""zup"" and ""walm"" translate to ""yellow.""
- The fourth example, ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax,"" translates to ""green blue yellow red yellow green."" Given that ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" can be deduced to be ""green"" (since it translates the same at the beginning and the end), and ""lug"" can be deduced as ""blue"" through its position and resultant color.
- The fifth example, ""dax zup lug wif zup,"" translates to ""green yellow blue red yellow."" This further confirms the meanings of ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif.""

Based on this analysis, the rule for ""zup"" is consistent across all the examples, and its meaning does not change with context. Therefore, ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",-3.87521154264,40,zup
"Based on the examples provided, each word seems to correspond to a color:

bluf -> yellow
wif -> red
walm -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.",-5.46925370339,40,zup
"Based on the provided examples, zup consistently translates to the color yellow regardless of its position within the inputs. 

This conclusion can be drawn as follows:

- In all instances where 'zup' appears, the output includes the word 'yellow.'
- 'zup' does not depend on the position within the sequence, as it results in 'yellow' whether it's in the beginning, middle, or end of the input.
- The position of 'zup' relative to other words does not alter its output; it is consistent across all examples.

Therefore, the rule can be defined as follows:

zup -> meaning. Rule: 'zup' consistently translates to the color 'yellow.'",-10.44094196152,40,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow."" It does not appear to change meaning based on position or the presence of other words. Therefore, we can write the rule as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",-10.555847493485999,40,zup
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to examine the patterns in the input and output sequences. Let's start by isolating instances of ""bluf"" and its output counterpart:

1. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
2. wif dax zup wif dax bluf -> red green yellow red green green
3. lug zup bluf dax -> blue yellow yellow green
4. dax bluf lug wif -> green green blue red
5. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red

Looking at the examples we see that ""bluf"" always has a pair of colors in the output which are identical. We also observe that, in every case, the color preceding ""bluf"" is the same color repeated twice in the output. This implies that ""bluf"" may mean to repeat the color of the word immediately prior to it.

For instance:
- Example 1: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow.""
- Example 2: The word immediately before ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" thus ""bluf"" translates to ""green green.""
- Example 3: ""zup"" is before ""bluf"" and corresponds to ""yellow,"" making ""bluf"" output ""yellow yellow.""
- Example 4: ""dax"" comes before ""bluf"" and matches ""green,"" so ""bluf"" means ""green green.""
- Example 5: Here, ""wif"" is before ""bluf"" and represents ""red,"" so ""bluf"" leads to ""red red.""

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" is to output the color associated with the immediately preceding word, repeated twice.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the previous word twice.",-0.8233554424299999,40,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the output color corresponding to the nonce word ""bluf"" depends on the color that is output by the word immediately preceding ""bluf"".

Let's examine each case:

- In the first example, ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"" and the output for ""zup"" is ""yellow"" followed by another ""yellow"" for ""bluf"".
- In the second example, ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" translates to ""red green yellow red green green"". Here, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output for ""dax"" is ""green"", so ""bluf"" also outputs ""green"".
- In the third example, ""lug zup bluf dax"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow green"". Here, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output for ""zup"" is ""yellow"", so ""bluf"" also outputs ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""dax bluf lug wif"" translates to ""green green blue red"". Here, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output for ""dax"" is ""green"", so ""bluf"" also outputs ""green"".
- In the fifth example, ""dax walm wif bluf"" translates to ""green green green red red"". Here, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output for ""wif"" is ""red"", so ""bluf"" also outputs ""red"".

By observing these patterns, we can deduce the rule for ""bluf"" as follows:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""bluf"" outputs the same color as the word immediately before it.",-1.474099636728,40,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" by examining its relationship with other known words and their corresponding color outputs. Here's a breakdown of each example:

1. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   - Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and both are translated to ""yellow.""

2. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
   Output: red green yellow red green green
   - In this case, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the result is ""green,"" which is the same color as the output for ""dax.""

3. Input: lug zup bluf dax
   Output: blue yellow yellow green
   - ""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" again, with ""yellow"" as the output for both.

4. Input: dax bluf lug wif
   Output: green green blue red
   - ""Bluf"" follows ""dax"" with ""green"" as the output for both.

5. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   - ""Bluf"" follows ""wif"" with ""red"" as the output for both.

From these examples, we can induce that the rule for ""bluf"" is to repeat the color of the word that precedes it. Therefore:

**Rule:** bluf -> Repeats the color associated with the previous word.

In each case, ""bluf"" takes the color of the word directly before it. Hence, ""bluf"" is a mimic or a repeater for the color of the preceding word.",-5.723028902628999,40,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color that immediately follows the color corresponding to the word preceding ""bluf."" For example, if the color before ""bluf"" is ""yellow,"" then ""bluf"" translates to ""green,"" which follows yellow in the given sequence.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

bluf -> meaning: The color that is next in the sequence following the color represented by the word immediately before ""bluf."" If there is no word before ""bluf"" or the preceding color is the last in a sequence, the color for ""bluf"" repeats the preceding color.",-9.20158157062,40,bluf
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it.,-9.514553235800001,40,bluf
"In each example, the occurrence of the word 'walm' corresponds to repeating the color related to the word immediately preceding it. So, 'walm' seems to function as an instruction to repeat the color associated with the previous word.

Given the data:

- ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue,"" where 'walm' causes the repetition of the color 'red' which is associated with 'wif'.
- ""wif dax lug walm"" translates to ""red green blue blue blue,"" where 'walm' causes the repetition of the color 'blue' which is associated with 'lug'.
- ""zup lug walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue,"" where 'walm' causes the repetition of the color 'blue' which is associated with 'lug'.

- ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" where 'walm' causes the repetition of the color 'yellow' which is associated with 'zup'.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.",-1.0649985859920001,40,walm
"From the given examples, we can induce the following patterns for the outputs corresponding to each input:

1. Whenever ""walm"" is present, the color blue appears an additional number of times minus one, compared to the previous color's number of occurrences.
2. ""Zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
3. ""Wif"" corresponds to the color red.
4. ""Lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
5. ""Dax"" corresponds to the color green.

Looking closely at the examples:

- In the ""zup wif walm lug"" -> ""yellow red red red blue"": The presence of ""walm"" resulted in an additional two reds before the blue that ""lug"" represents.
- In the ""wif dax lug walm"" -> ""red green blue blue blue"": Here, ""walm"" adds two more blues to the one from ""lug"".
- In the ""zup lug walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue"": Again, ""walm"" adds two more blues to the one from ""lug"".
- In the ""lug walm zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow red"": Here, we see that the order of colors does not matter; ""walm"" still adds two blues after ""lug"".
- In the ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"": ""Walm"" adds two additional yellows, following the pattern.

The pattern suggests that ""walm"" tends to replicate the previous color mentioned an additional two times. However, in the case where there's no explicit color before ""walm"" (as shown in ""zup walm""), ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the word before it, which in this case is ""zup"" yellow.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color denoted by the preceding word three times.",-4.90349573973,40,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I will look for patterns in the examples provided. Let's analyze each example and their outputs:

4. Input: lug walm zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red
   
5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

In each example, ""walm"" is present, and it appears to contribute to a repetition of the color (in the output) that precedes it:

1. ""walm lug"" leads to ""red red blue."" Prior to this, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   
2. ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue."" Prior to this, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   
3. ""lug walm"" again leads to ""blue blue blue."" Here as well, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   
4. ""walm zup wif"" leads to ""blue blue yellow red."" Prior to this, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   
5. ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow."" Prior to this, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Based on these patterns, it would seem that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately before it. In the absence of a word before it, as in example 5, ""walm"" is associated with the color corresponding to ""zup,"" which comes right after. 

This would imply:

2. ""dax wif walm"" corresponds to ""green red red red.""
3. ""lug wif"" corresponds to ""blue red.""
4. ""dax wif"" corresponds to ""green red.""
5. ""wif dax bluf"" corresponds to ""red green green.""

We notice that in examples 1, 3, and 4, ""wif"" appears at the end of the input and corresponds to a ""red"" at the end of the output.

In example 5, ""wif"" is at the beginning of the input and corresponds to the ""red"" at the beginning of the output.

We also notice that the presence of other words like ""dax,"" ""bluf,"" and ""lug"" in the input seems to correspond to distinct colors like ""green"" and ""blue"" in the output, and when they are paired with ""wif,"" the consistent color that ""wif"" corresponds to is ""red.""

Therefore, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red.",-0.8621348987800002,41,wif
"To induce the rule for the nonce word ""wif,"" we look at each occurrence and the corresponding output:

1. dax bluf wif -> green green red
2. dax wif walm -> green red red red
3. lug wif -> blue red
4. dax wif -> green red
5. wif dax bluf -> red green green

Analyzing the outputs, we can see that the presence of ""wif"" always corresponds with a ""red"" in the output. In examples 1, 4, and 5, where ""dax"" is present, it corresponds to ""green."" In example 3, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" And in example 2, ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" repeated for every letter in ""walm.""

Since ""wif"" changes position in the input but always results in ""red"" in the output, it seems to be independent of its position and is not tied to a particular corresponding word (like ""dax"" or ""lug"").

From these observations, the rule for ""wif"" can be deduced as:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input.

Hence,
wif -> red",-1.137752444992,41,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following relationships:

- The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""
- The word ""bluf"" also corresponds to the color ""green.""
- The word ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" repeated four times, indicating that the number of letters in ""walm"" might be linked to the number of times ""red"" appears in the output.
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Now we must determine what ""wif"" means within this context. It appears alongside other words, and when it stands alone with ""dax"" or ""lug,"" it produces ""red"" immediately after it. When it precedes ""dax"" and ""bluf,"" its corresponding color comes before the colors associated with those words.

From these observations, we can infer that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" It doesn't seem to affect the output's length—only the order of the colors.

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" is:

wif -> red.

2. wif bluf -> red red
3. lug bluf -> blue blue
4. wif dax zup bluf -> red green yellow yellow
5. lug dax bluf zup lug wif -> blue green green yellow blue red

From these examples, we can consistently observe that the color word immediately preceding ""bluf"" is repeated in the output. This allows us to induce the following rule:

bluf -> The color word preceding ""bluf"" is repeated in the output.

So, if ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", then ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red"". If ""lug"" stands for ""blue"", then ""lug bluf"" becomes ""blue blue"". Hence, ""bluf"" acts as an instruction to repeat the color mentioned right before it.",-1.019258228386,42,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it in the sequence. Here are the observed patterns:

- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is blue for both ""lug"" and ""bluf"" (""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue"").
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is green for ""dax"" but yellow for ""bluf"" (""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow""), which is contradicting since ""zup"" already maps to yellow.
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is red for both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" (""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"").

Upon re-evaluation of the outputs and looking for consistency, it seems like the ""green"" output for ""dax"" precedes a ""yellow"" output for ""bluf,"" which indicates that ""bluf"" is taking on the color ""yellow,"" not green. Considering the influence of adjacent words, it's important to recognize that while ""dax"" leads to both ""green"" and ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" always results in ""yellow"" when it follows ""dax.""

After reviewing the sequences and their corresponding outputs once again and correcting the second point to be consistent with the pattern found in the last input, here's the refined rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" means to repeat the color of the word directly before it.",-6.380996768212001,42,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. Given the provided examples, the meaning of ""bluf"" can be deduced by examining its corresponding output in each case.

Example 1:
Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow

In this first example, every other word has a corresponding color output except ""bluf,"" which seems to correspond to the color ""yellow."" However, we cannot yet determine if ""bluf"" always means ""yellow,"" as ""zup"" also corresponds to ""yellow.""

Example 2:
Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

In this second example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red,"" which suggests the possibility that ""bluf"" may take on the meaning of the color word that precedes it.

Example 3:
Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Just as with the previous examples, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" takes on the same color, reinforcing the idea that ""bluf"" might replicate the color of the word before it.

Example 4:
Input: wif dax zup bluf
Output: red green yellow yellow

In this example, the pattern holds. ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""

Example 5:
Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
Output: blue green green yellow blue red

Again, the output for ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""bluf"" that comes after ""dax"" also corresponds to the color green. The pattern is consistent with previous input-output pairs.

Rule:
Considering all the examples, we can deduce that ""bluf"" takes on the meaning (or color) of the word that immediately precedes it. 

bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is to replicate or take on the color of the preceding word.",-8.094854710664999,42,bluf
"Based on the examples given, each instance of ""bluf"" produces an output that repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it:

1. In the first example ""dax zup lug zup bluf,"" ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" and translates to blue, so ""bluf"" also translates to blue.
   
2. In the second example ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and translates to red, so ""bluf"" also translates to red.

3. In the third example ""lug bluf,"" ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" and translates to blue, so ""bluf"" also translates to blue.

4. In the fourth example ""wif dax zup bluf,"" ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and translates to yellow, so ""bluf"" also translates to yellow.

5. In the fifth example ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif,"" ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and translates to green, so ""bluf"" translates to green in this instance.

So the rule is as follows: 
bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is the same color as the word immediately before it.

Rule: If a word X precedes the word ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" translates to the color that word X represents.",-8.23108864272,42,bluf
"Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to trigger a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it, three times. 

For instance:
1. ""zup walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow"" – ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" repeats this color thrice.
2. ""lug walm"" in ""lug walm zup lug walm"" gives ""blue blue blue"" before ""yellow"", which is from ""zup"", and then ""blue blue blue"" again after ""zup"", as ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
3. ""dax walm"" in ""dax walm wif bluf"" gives ""green green green"" and ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"", since ""wif"" comes before ""bluf"" and seems to correspond to a single ""red""; ""bluf"" has no rule evident from the examples and thus does not repeat.
4. For ""zup dax walm zup wif"", ""zup"" forthwith is ""yellow"", followed by ""dax"" which is green, leading to ""walm"" causing ""green green green"". Finally, ""zup wif"" results in ""yellow red"", with ""wif"" seemingly causing ""red"" to follow.

Therefore: walm -> triggers a repetition of the previous color word mentioned, three times.",-3.2875644871,42,walm
"Reviewing the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the colored output that directly follows it. Here's the breakdown:

- The first instance of ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which indicates that ""walm"" causes the word before it, ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" to be repeated three times.

- The same occurs with the second instance of ""zup walm.""

- In the third example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" again repeating ""blue,"" indicated by ""lug,"" three times. 

- ""Dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" suggesting that ""dax"" means ""green,"" and ""walm"" is causing the repetition.

- Lastly, with ""zup dax walm zup wif,"" we see ""yellow"" followed by ""green green green"" and then ""yellow"" again, followed by ""red,"" further supporting the idea that ""walm"" causes the color word before it to be said three times.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color word preceding it to be repeated three times in the output.

Walm -> Causes the preceding color word to repeat three times.",-4.04151552858,42,walm

2. Whenever ""lug"" is present, the output is ""blue.""
3. Whenever ""dax"" is present, the output is ""green.""
4. Whenever ""wif"" is present, the output is ""red.""

Now we need to understand how ""walm"" affects the output:

- In the first two examples, ""walm"" is placed after ""zup,"" and the output is a repetition of ""yellow"" three times.
- In the third example, ""walm"" is placed after ""lug"" and before ""zup,"" and the output repeats the color associated with ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" three times, but after ""zup,"" the color does not repeat.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" leading to ""green"" being repeated three times, and then ""bluf"" leads to two ""red"" outputs.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and ""green"" is repeated three times, then ""zup"" and ""wif"" respectively correspond to ""yellow"" and ""red.""

3. Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green
4. Input: zup dax bluf -> Output: yellow green green

- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" we get ""yellow yellow.""
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" we get ""red red.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" we get ""green green.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the given examples, let's analyze the pattern of outputs corresponding to the presence of ""walm"" and other words.

Looking at all the inputs that contain ""walm"", we see that the word immediately following ""walm"" is always red, except when ""walm"" is the last word. Let's now look at the color immediately preceding ""walm"":

1. In the first example, ""dax walm zup"" translates to ""green green green"", suggesting a repeated green before turning to the next color associated with ""zup"" (yellow).

2. In the second example, ""wif walm lug"" translates to ""red red red"", suggesting repeated red before turning to the next color associated with ""lug"" (blue).

3. The third example is simpler: ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"", which shows us that ""walm"" is followed by repetitions of ""red"".

4. The fourth example, ""dax walm wif,"" translates to ""green green green red,"" again suggesting that ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color green before finally transitioning to red.

5. In the last example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" showing us once more that ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the preceding color which is yellow.

From these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat the color corresponding to the previous word until the next word, which will have its own color. If ""walm"" is at the end, it will simply repeat the color corresponding to the word just before it without a transition to another color.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> causes a repetition of the previous color in the output until the next word. If ""walm"" is the last word, that color is simply repeated.",-5.156329889579999,43,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to change the meaning of the output colors according to the following pattern: after walm is used, the colors repeat in reverse order of their appearance immediately before ""walm,"" until the sequence reaches the start of the input or another walm. ""Walm"" itself, when first encountered, translates into the color that immediately precedes it.

Let's analyze the provided examples to pinpoint the pattern:

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red
Explanation: 
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds to green
- ""walm"" changes ""dax"" to green (same color that immediately precedes it)
- Following ""walm,"" the pattern reverses: ""zup"" is now green instead of its original yellow
- ""wif"" at the end becomes yellow, the color that ""zup"" was the first time

Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow
Explanation: 
- ""dax"" corresponds to green
- ""wif"" corresponds to red
- ""walm"" changes ""wif"" to red
- Following ""walm,"" the pattern reverses: ""lug"" is now red instead of blue, and ""zup"" is yellow, the original color of ""dax""

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
Explanation: 
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow
- ""wif"" corresponds to red
- ""walm"" changes ""wif"" to red
- There is nothing after ""walm"" in this case, so the output ends there

Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
Output: blue green yellow green green green red
Explanation: 
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to green
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow
- The second ""dax"" is still green
- ""walm"" changes the second ""dax"" to green
- Following ""walm,"" the pattern reverses with ""zup"" now green instead of yellow and ""dax"" green as it was originally
- ""wif"" at the end becomes red, the original color of ""lug""

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
Explanation: 
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow
- ""walm"" changes ""zup"" to yellow
- Since ""zup"" is the first word and also yellow, the output repeats the yellow color after ""walm""

Rule: walm -> Changes the output color to the color that immediately precedes it, and then causes the following colors to reverse their sequence in the output, becoming the colors they were in the input before ""walm"" appeared. If ""walm"" is the last word or if it's followed by another ""walm,"" the last color before ""walm"" will simply repeat.
",-5.607395528703,43,walm
"Based on the output associated with each input, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the previous color in the sequence, with the number of repetitions equal to the number of times ""walm"" appears. Additionally, the other words ""zup,"" ""dax,"" ""wif,"" and ""lug"" seem to be consistently mapped to specific colors regardless of their position in the sequence.

Here are the apparent mappings for the other words:
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""lug"" -> blue

With this in mind, let's deduce the rule for ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) and results in three repetitions of green.
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) and results again in three repetitions of red.
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), leading again to three repetitions of red.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" (red) comes after ""walm,"" which follows ""dax"" (green), hence ""walm"" seems to extend the sequence of greens before the red.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and leads to two repetitions of yellow including the initial ""zup.""

Given this information, the rule for ""walm"" appears as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word. The number of repetitions corresponds to the number of ""walm"" appearances plus one for the original color appearance.",-7.94155283614,43,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns before and after it appears in the examples. The output is a sequence of colors that correspond to the input sequence of words which includes ""walm.""

1. In ``zup dax walm zup wif``, ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""zup"". The corresponding output for ""dax"" is ""green"" and for ""zup"" is ""yellow"". The output for ""walm"" in this case is ""green green green yellow"".

2. In ``dax wif walm lug zup``, ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""lug"". The corresponding output for ""wif"" is ""red"" and for ""lug"" is ""red"". The output for ""walm"" in this case is ""red red red blue"".

3. In ``zup wif walm``, ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" and has no following word. The corresponding output for ""wif"" is ""red"". The output for ""walm"" in this case is ""red red red"".

4. In ``lug dax zup dax walm wif``, ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""wif"". The corresponding output for ""dax"" is ""green"" and for ""wif"" is ""red"". The output for ""walm"" in this case is ""green green green red"".

5. In ``zup walm``, ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" and has no following word. The corresponding output for ""zup"" is ""yellow"". The output for ""walm"" in this case is ""yellow yellow yellow"".

Based on the outputs associated with ""walm,"" it seems that ""walm"" replicates the color of the word that precedes it three times in the output. If there is a word after ""walm,"" it takes the color of that word for its last color in its output. If there is no word following ""walm,"" it repeats the color of the preceding word for all four outputs.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" results in the color of the word before it being repeated three times. If there is another word after ""walm,"" the fourth color is the color of that following word. If there is no word after ""walm,"" the fourth color repeats the color of the word before it.

- Example 1: ""dax wif"" corresponds to ""green red.""
- Example 2: ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" corresponds to ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow."" Since ""dax"" is only at the beginning, it can be inferred that ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- Example 3 (repetition of example 1): ""dax wif"" corresponds to ""green red"" again reaffirming the translation.
- Example 4: ""zup lug dax"" corresponds to ""yellow blue green."" ""Dax"" is at the end and ""green"" accounts for its position.
- Example 5: ""dax lug wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green blue red red."" Again, ""dax"" is at the start and corresponds to ""green.""

Rule: ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""",-1.1326161055219999,44,dax
"Rule: The word ""dax"" signifies a color change sequence starting with green.

Explanation:

In each example where ""dax"" appears, the sequence always starts with the color green. The subsequent colors don't seem to be dependent on the presence of ""dax"", as ""wif"" appears to consistently result in red, ""walm"" in yellow, ""lug"" in blue, and ""zup"" in yellow. The repetition of ""walm"" causing a sequence of yellows and the lack of additional greens after the initial ""dax wif"" or ""dax lug wif"" sequences seems to indicate that ""dax"" does not repeat its effect and affects only the first term following it.

dax -> the rule is that ""dax"" indicates the starting color green, followed by other colors which are determined by the sequence of words following ""dax"".",-6.03647730348,44,dax
"To induce the rules related to the nonce word ""dax,"" we need to analyze the Input/Output pairs provided.

Input: dax wif
Output: green red

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

Input: dax wif
Output: green red

Input: zup lug dax
Output: yellow blue green

Input: dax lug wif bluf
Output: green blue red red

Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

1. In the first and third examples, ""dax wif"" consistently translates to ""green red.""
2. In the second example, the appearance of ""dax wif"" at the beginning still results in ""green red,"" while the remaining words ""walm lug zup walm"" translate to ""red red blue yellow yellow yellow."" Notably, the repeated word ""walm"" generates more ""yellow""s. 
3. In the fourth example, the word ""dax"" appears at the end, and its position doesn't affect its associated color ""green.""
4. In the fifth example, ""dax lug wif bluf"" translates to ""green blue red red,"" indicating that ""dax"" is still ""green"" despite being followed by different words.

The rule appears to be quite straightforward:

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence. The context or surrounding words do not seem to affect this translation. 

Therefore:

dax -> green. Rule: ""dax"" consistently means ""green,"" and the meaning is context-independent.",-6.462279400079,44,dax

This suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm

Here we can see that ""dax"" is still producing ""green"" and ""wif"" is producing ""red."" Furthermore, ""lug"" seems to consistently correspond to ""blue,"" while ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Also, it looks like repeating a word prolongs its corresponding color.

Input: dax wif
Output: green red

Again, this confirms that ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" and ""wif"" with ""red.""

"Based on the examples provided, the following observations can be made:

1. ""lug bluf"" outputs ""blue blue"" which indicates that ""bluf"" might stand for ""blue"", given ""lug"" also translates to ""blue"".

3. ""dax zup bluf"" outputs ""green yellow yellow"", suggesting that ""bluf"" represents ""yellow"" in this instance, following ""zup"" which also means ""yellow"".

- zup -> yellow

When ""bluf"" follows any of these words, it repeats the color associated with that word in pairs, as seen in the outputs. For example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"" because ""lug"" is associated with blue, and ""bluf"" repeats it.

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the one instance it appears.

Now, we observe what happens when ""walm"" is introduced:

3. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
4. ""dax zup dax walm"" -> ""green yellow green green green""
5. ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green""

Analyzing the patterns, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word that comes before it, given that after ""walm"" is introduced, the color that follows is a repetition of the color corresponding to the word just before ""walm.""

- In ""dax walm zup,"" again we have ""dax"" for green, then ""walm"" repeats the green three times followed by ""zup"" for yellow.
- In ""wif walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" repeats red three times: red red red.
- In ""dax zup dax walm,"" the sequence is green (dax), yellow (zup), green (dax), and then ""walm"" causes the preceding color green to be repeated three times.
- In ""zup walm lug zup wif dax,"" we have yellow (zup), then ""walm"" makes it repeat three times (yellow yellow yellow), blue (lug), yellow (zup), red (wif), green (dax).

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: Repeat the color that comes immediately before ""walm"" as many times as the number of colors that come before ""walm.""

So we get:

walm -> repetition of the preceding color, with the count being the number of distinct color words preceding it in the sequence.",-2.4638730839200003,44,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following patterns for each word:

- Whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the corresponding output is ""green.""
- Whenever the word ""zup"" appears, the corresponding output is ""yellow.""
- Whenever the word ""wif"" appears, the corresponding output is ""red.""
- The presence of the word ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" in the output.

The word ""walm"" appears in each input and seems to contribute to the output in the following way:

1. When preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green,"" which suggests that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word, as ""dax"" contributes to a single ""green.""
2. When followed by ""zup"" in ""dax walm zup,"" it still gives ""green green green yellow,"" where ""yellow"" is linked to ""zup,"" and ""walm"" once again seems to be repeating ""green"" associated with ""dax.""
3. When preceded by ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red,"" again indicating repetition, but this time of ""red"" associated with ""wif.""
4. When preceded and followed by ""dax,"" as in ""dax zup dax walm,"" the output follows the colors associated with each known word but ends with ""green green green"" corresponding to ""dax walm,"" again suggesting repetition.
5. In the mixed example ""zup walm lug zup wif dax,"" we see the output corresponds to the known words ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""dax,"" with an additional ""yellow yellow yellow"" in place associated with ""walm,"" which this time repeats the color for ""zup,"" which was the word right before it.

From these observations, we can deduce that the rule for ""walm"" involves repeating the color associated with the word that precedes it three times.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.",-4.23419918198,44,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to observe its usage and the pattern of outputs in different contexts. Here are the given examples with their corresponding outputs, along with an analysis of each:

1. Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green
2. Input: dax walm zup -> Output: green green green yellow
3. Input: wif walm -> Output: red red red
4. Input: dax zup dax walm -> Output: green yellow green green green
5. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

From these examples, it's clear that the presence of ""walm"" results in a repetition of the same color output: ""green"" after ""dax,"" ""red"" after ""wif,"" and ""yellow"" after ""zup."" Therefore, observing the pattern, it seems that ""walm"" means to repeat the output color associated with the word that comes before it.

Walm -> meaning: ""Repeat the output color associated with the previous word.""

Rule:
- If ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" repeated.
- If ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red"" repeated.
- If ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow"" repeated. 

For example, in ""dax walm,"" since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" results in repeating ""green"" three times. Similarly, in ""zup walm lug zup wif dax,"" the word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and when followed by ""walm,"" it results in ""yellow"" being repeated three times before the pattern resets with a new color for ""lug.""",-5.850872842788001,44,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should first analyze how the presence of ""walm"" in the input affects the output. The provided examples indicate a consistent pattern:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" (examples 1, 3, 4), the output corresponding to ""walm"" is ""green.""
- However, when ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" (example 3), the output corresponding to ""walm"" is ""red.""
- The presence of other words before ""walm"" does not change the output of ""walm"" (example 5).

Based on this analysis, it seems that ""walm"" translates to a color, but the specific color is determined by the word immediately preceding it.

- ""dax"" before ""walm"" causes ""walm"" to output ""green.""
- ""wif"" before ""walm"" causes ""walm"" to output ""red.""
- The color for ""walm"" when preceded by any other word is not shown in the examples, except for ""lug"" in example 5, which results in ""blue,"" but since there is only one instance, we can't readily generalize the rule from that alone.

Therefore, the rule we can induce is that ""walm"" outputs a color dependent on the word immediately before it. When that word is ""dax,"" the color is ""green""; when it is ""wif,"" the color is ""red."" There's not enough data to determine what happens with other precedents.

- The positions of other words (e.g., ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup"") correlate with other colors in the output (""blue,"" ""green,"" and ""yellow"" respectively), but ""wif"" consistently correlates with ""red.""

2. When ""lug walm zup walm"" is mentioned, ""lug"" and ""walm"" precede ""zup,"" each is output as ""blue"" three times, and then ""zup"" is output as ""yellow"" three times. (Example 3)
3. When ""zup lug"" is mentioned, ""zup"" is output as ""yellow"" and ""lug"" as ""blue."" (Example 4)
4. When ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" is mentioned, ""wif"" leads to the output of ""red"" three times, ""walm"" isn't directly followed by a color output, ""zup"" is output as ""yellow"" and is followed by ""lug"" which is ""blue,"" and then ""zup"" is followed again by ""yellow"" two times, and ""walm"" at the end leads to ""yellow"" two times. (Example 5)

From these observations, one can infer that ""zup"" may not have a fixed meaning on its own, but may rather signify a repetition of the color output associated with the preceding word, repeated the same number of times as the preceding output. However, the last example complicates this because ""wif"" and ""walm"" do not have an immediate repeated color output, and the repetition doesn't hold consistently for these cases. Additional patterns or examples would be needed to refine this rule.

Based on the limited data and to keep it as consistent as possible with the provided examples, we could infer the following:

Rule: ""zup"" means to repeat the color output of the word before it the same number of times the color has been output right before ""zup.""

"Observing the outputs, it's clear that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"". However, before we can finalize this rule for ""zup"", we should also analyze the other words in the provided examples to ensure that their outputs are consistent and do not affect the meaning of ""zup"".

- ""lug"" always translates to ""blue"".
- ""walm"" seems to consistently result in three repetitions of the color in the output.

Given these observations, we have:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- walm -> three repetitions of the consequent color.

Hence, the rule for ""zup"" irrespective of the context appears to be that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"". Therefore:

Rule: zup -> yellow",-5.100837031359999,46,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the output includes the color ""yellow."" However, there is a pattern that suggests a rule for the number of times ""yellow"" appears in the output. Let's break down the examples and look for patterns:

Example 1:
Input: zup
Output: yellow

Here, ""zup"" results in a single ""yellow.""

Example 2:
Input: zup
Output: yellow

Again, ""zup"" by itself results in a single ""yellow.""

Example 3:
Input: lug walm zup walm
Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow

""lug"" seems to translate to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" seems to represent the repetition of the previous color mentioned in the output. Since ""walm"" is mentioned twice before ""zup"" and once after, it causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times before ""zup"" and two additional ""yellow"" after the initial ""yellow"" from ""zup."" This suggests that ""walm"" may influence the number of times ""yellow"" repeats after ""zup.""

Example 4:
Input: zup lug
Output: yellow blue

Here, ""zup"" is followed by ""lug,"" which results in ""yellow"" followed by ""blue,"" with no repetition noticed.

Example 5:
Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

The word ""wif"" appears to translate to ""red"" and is repeated thrice because of ""walm"" following it. Examining the sequence ""zup lug zup walm,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" then ""zup"" again translates to ""yellow."" Here ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" indicating it should repeat ""yellow."" However, there are three repetitions instead of the expected two, suggesting there could be carryover repetition from previous instances of ""zup.""

The repetitions of colors appear to be dictated by the words ""walm"" and the mention of a color word or a nonce word that has a color meaning before it. Specifically, ""walm"" repeats the color output preceding it and seems to be cumulative or additive when encountering multiple instances.

Rule:
The nonce word ""zup"" means ""yellow."" When followed by ""walm,"" ""zup"" causes ""yellow"" to repeat a number of times equal to the repetitions of ""walm"" before it, with possible additional repeats if there are multiple sequences of ""zup walm"" without an intervening color word.",-5.4250119998669994,46,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output. The number of occurrences of ""zup"" corresponds to the number of times ""yellow"" appears in the output:

- ""zup"" on its own results in a single ""yellow""
- ""zup"" followed by other words ""lug"" still results in ""yellow"" for ""zup"" and a different color for ""lug""
- Multiple ""zup"" instances increase the number of ""yellow"" outputs accordingly

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

zup -> ""yellow""

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the presence of other words.",-7.37325760088,46,zup
"To deduce the meaning of 'zup,' I'll need to look closely at the given examples and analyze the patterns.

1. Input: zup → Output: yellow
2. Input: zup → Output: yellow
Every time 'zup' appears as a solitary word in the input, the output is 'yellow.' This suggests a direct translation for 'zup' being the color 'yellow.'

3. Input: lug walm zup walm → Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
In this example, 'zup' is preceded by 'lug walm' which translates to 'blue blue,' and followed by 'walm' which translates to 'blue.' The output in sequence is 'blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow,' with the appearance of 'zup' correlating with three 'yellow's that follow. This might suggest 'zup' not only translates to 'yellow,' but also dictates the number of 'yellow' repeats, potentially influenced by the number of words preceding it. However, this rule doesn't fit with the previous examples where 'zup' occurs alone, so this interpretation might be incorrect.

4. Input: zup lug → Output: yellow blue
Once again, 'zup' appears first and translates directly to 'yellow,' followed by 'lug' which translates to 'blue.' This is consistent with the understanding of 'zup' as 'yellow.'

5. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm → Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
In this example, we note that 'wif walm' translates to 'red red' and 'lug' translates to 'blue.' The two instances of 'zup' are separated by 'lug.' From the output, we can see that after 'wif walm,' we have three 'red's making us to revisit the thought that the number of colors before 'zup' might impact the replication of 'yellow' after 'zup.' The pattern is not entirely clear but focusing purely on 'zup':

First 'zup' → one 'yellow' follows it,
Second 'zup' → two 'yellow's follow it.

Considering the input 'lug walm zup walm,' it could mean that the number of 'yellow's following 'zup' is influenced by the number of words between the 'zup's or before 'zup.' However, with the given information, this pattern is not consistently conclusive.

Based on the available information, and the consistencies across examples, the most straightforward rule we can deduce is that:

"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color produced by either combining the colors immediately preceding it or by repeating the color of the word that precedes it. Let's identify the patterns:

1. dax bluf wif -> green green red
   - ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and both have the output of green. It's not followed by any identical terms, so it looks like ""bluf"" takes the color of the term before it.

2. lug bluf dax lug -> blue blue green blue
   - ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and both have the output of blue.

3. lug zup bluf dax -> blue yellow yellow green
   - ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and repeats the output of yellow.

4. wif bluf -> red red
   - ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and both have the output of red.

5. zup lug zup lug zup bluf -> yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
   - ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and repeats the output color of yellow.

Looking at all these patterns, the rule that seems to be consistently applied is:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the immediate word preceding it.

So, bluf -> meaning. Meaning is: the color corresponding to the word that precedes ""bluf"".",-1.19869866814,46,bluf
"Rule: bluf represents the color that follows it. If there is no color following ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" represents the color that preceded it.

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" which corresponds to red. Hence, ""bluf"" corresponds to red.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" which corresponds to green. Hence, ""bluf"" corresponds to green.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" which also corresponds to green. So ""bluf"" corresponds to green again.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is not followed by any color, but it is preceded by ""wif,"" which is red. So ""bluf"" takes on the color that precedes it, which is red.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is not followed by a color. The sequence before ""bluf"" is ""lug zup,"" which corresponds to blue and yellow, but considering the pattern we've seen, the immediate color before ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" which is yellow. Therefore, ""bluf"" corresponds to yellow.

bluf -> meaning: Bluf represents the color that follows it; if no color follows ""bluf,"" it represents the color that preceded it.",-4.3118708247079995,46,bluf
"Rule: The word bluf corresponds to the color of the word immediately following it. If there is no word after bluf, it defaults to red. 

bluf -> meaning.

- Following ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, ""bluf"" also means green.
- Following ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, ""bluf"" also means blue.
- In the case where ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence, as in ""wif bluf,"" it means red, which follows the default rule. 

Rule: bluf means the same color as the following word; if no word follows, it means red.",-6.813346634972001,46,bluf
"Considering the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or the rule behind the nonce word ""bluf"".

Input: dax bluf wif | Output: green green red
Input: lug bluf dax lug | Output: blue blue green blue
Input: lug zup bluf dax | Output: blue yellow yellow green
Input: wif bluf | Output: red red
Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf | Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow

We can see that the output color following ""bluf"" matches the color that was described immediately before ""bluf"". For instance, if ""wif"" is red, then ""wif bluf"" yields ""red red"". If ""dax"" is green, then ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green"".

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the previous word.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it.",-7.919797738000999,46,bluf
"Bluf -> meaning. Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that bluf takes the color of the word immediately preceding it, as seen in each example where the output color for bluf matches the color of the word just before it.

Rule: bluf takes the color of the preceding word.",-8.48041489238,46,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the color outputs relevant to its presence:

- ""dax walm lug"" outputs ""green green green blue""
- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" outputs ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue""
- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue""
- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow""

From these examples, we can see that whenever ""walm"" appears, the output color is repeated three times. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it indicates that the color should be repeated three times. It is not the source of the color itself but rather a modifier that dictates the quantity of the previous color output to be repeated.

Rule: walm -> repeat the previous color three times.",-1.2282117334,46,walm
"The provided examples indicate that the nonce word ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Each time ""walm"" is used, the color that corresponds to the preceding word is repeated three times.

- In the first example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green."" It suggests that ""dax"" stands for ""green,"" and therefore ""walm"" causes it to repeat.
- In the second example, ""zup walm"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup"" is correlated to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" repeats it.
- The third example, ""zup dax lug walm zup lug,"" provides a sequence of colors. ""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" which is then repeated three times.
- The fourth example, ""lug walm,"" again shows ""blue blue blue,"" confirming the pattern for ""lug"" and ""walm.""
- Finally, the fifth example is identical to the second, which shows the same pattern as before.

Based on observation, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" requires the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.",-3.9755009169499997,46,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat three times. To solidify this deduction, let's examine how ""walm"" alters the output when it follows different words:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" (""dax walm""), the output is ""green green green blue"". ""Dax"" by itself would output ""green"", so with ""walm"" following it, ""green"" is repeated three times before the sequence continues.
- Similarly, when ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" (""zup walm""), the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"". Without ""walm"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", so ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to repeat three times.
- ""Lug"" by itself corresponds to ""blue"". When ""lug walm"" appears together, the output is ""blue blue blue"", indicating that ""walm"" is again causing the repetition of ""blue"" three times.

It's important to note that in the third example (""zup dax lug walm zup lug""), ""walm"" is followed by ""zup lug"", which should produce ""yellow green"", yet we observe that ""walm"" only affects the word that immediately precedes it (""blue"" from ""lug"") and the pattern continues as normal afterwards, indicating that ""walm"" does not carry its effect to subsequent words after the repetitions.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.",-4.318061938158001,46,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine where it appears and what comes before and after it.

In all examples, ""walm"" corresponds to a threefold repetition of the color code just before it:

- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green.""
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue.""

Hence, ""walm"" seems to indicate that the color named before it should be repeated three times. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color indicated before ""walm"" three times.",-5.065315522200001,46,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" translates into three repetitions of the color word that precedes it. 

Proof: 
- In ""dax walm lug,"" ""dax"" is translated to ""green,"" and next, we see ""walm,"" which results in ""green green green."" 
- In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow,"" followed by ""walm,"" which turns into ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- For ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" turns into ""blue,"" and ""walm"" produces ""blue blue blue.""

- In the second example, 'zup' precedes 'wif' and corresponds to 'yellow,' followed by 'red' for 'wif.'

- In the third example, 'zup' is followed by 'walm' (which translates to 'yellow') and then 'dax' (which translates to 'green'), so 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow' here as well.

- In the fifth example, 'zup' directly precedes 'lug' and still corresponds to 'yellow,' followed by 'blue' for 'lug.'

- In the second example, ""lug bluf"" leads to ""blue blue."" Again, ""bluf"" is repeating the color of the word before it.

- The fifth example has ""zup bluf lug walm,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow blue blue blue."" This again shows that ""bluf"" is repeating the color of the word before it twice, since the color of ""lug,"" which is blue, is repeated three times.

5. In ""wif zup bluf lug walm"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""yellow"", followed by ""lug walm"" which corresponds to ""blue blue blue"".

From this, we can establish the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color word immediately prior to it in the sequence.",-4.491694201522,47,bluf
"Analyzing the given examples and their corresponding outputs:

   Output: green red red

4. Input: lug walm wif bluf

From the given examples, we can observe that ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the previously mentioned color. For example, in input 1, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and following ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""

Another observation is the number of repeated colors after ""bluf"" matches the number of words preceding ""bluf"" in the input:

- In input 2 (""dax lug bluf wif""), there are two words before ""bluf,"" and we see ""blue blue"" (the color corresponding to ""lug"") in the output.

- In input 3 (""dax wif bluf""), there is ""red,"" followed by ""red red,"" indicating a repetition of the color corresponding to ""wif"" (which is ""red"") after ""bluf.""

- In input 4 (""lug walm wif bluf""), ""bluf"" is again preceded by three words, and we see ""red red"" after mentioning the color corresponding to ""wif.""

- In input 5 (""wif zup bluf lug walm""), ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow yellow,"" repeating the color corresponding to ""zup."" Additionally, the quantity of repetitions matches the words preceding ""bluf.""

3. The pattern repeated from example 1.
4. Two ""dax"" words preceded walm, leading to green being repeated three times, following the color for ""zup.""
5. ""lug"" preceded walm, resulting in blue being repeated three times.

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately before it to be repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.",-1.2537188860600001,47,walm

2. zup dax walm lug wif -> yellow green green green blue red
3. dax walm -> green green green
4. dax zup dax walm -> green yellow green green green
5. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue

From these examples, we notice that the output ""green green green"" follows immediately after ""dax walm"" without considering the rest of the inputs. This suggests that ""walm"" directly translates to ""green green green"", assuming that ""dax"" does not influence the meaning of ""walm.""

Also, considering inputs 2 and 4, the presence of other words before ""dax walm"" yields different colors but does not change the ""green green green"" sequence whenever ""dax walm"" appears together. In input 5, ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue"", which is the only case where ""walm"" is not immediately followed by ""green green green,"" indicating that ""lug"" might affect the translation of ""walm.""

Conclusively, we cannot ascertain the meaning of ""walm"" when ""lug"" precedes it. However, without the influence of ""lug,"" we can tentatively conclude the following:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" it means ""green green green.""

Thus: walm -> ""green green green"" (when following ""dax"")",-1.749722699314,47,walm
"Based on the given input-output pairs, we can deduce the following patterns for words other than ""walm"":

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red

For ""walm"", looking at the output, we see that ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color of the word before it. For instance:

- In ""dax walm"", ""dax"" leads to ""green"", and ""walm"" leads to ""green green green"".
- In ""zup dax walm lug wif"", ""dax"" is green, and after ""walm"" we see ""green green green"", followed by ""lug"" which is blue, and ""wif"" which is red.
- In ""dax zup dax walm"", ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output is three greens.

2. Regardless of the words that come before ""walm,"" the pattern holds—the three ""green"" colors always follow.
   
3. Another pattern is that the color before the three ""green"" colors corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" For example, in ""dax lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and we see ""blue"" followed by three ""green"" colors.
   
4. We can also identify that the word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" However, ""walm"" is consistently followed by ""green green green,"" regardless of the word that comes before it.

Rule: When ""dax"" precedes a color word, it changes the subsequent color to ""green."" If there is another color word after ""dax,"" that color is repeated in the output, otherwise the sequence ends with ""green."" If ""dax"" is the first word in the sequence, then it translates directly to ""green.""

Thus:
dax -> change the next color to ""green"" and if another color follows, repeat that changed color.",-5.252632843688999,48,dax
"Based on the examples you provided, it appears that the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" changes depending on its position and context within the sequence. However, there is a consistency in the color ""green"" being associated with ""dax"" in the output. Analyzing the pattern in the examples provided:

1. When ""dax"" is alone or followed by non-""dax"" words, it translates to ""green.""
2. When ""dax"" follows or is surrounded by non-""dax"" words, it results in ""green"" for each occurrence of ""dax.""
3. The number of times ""green"" is output does not always correspond directly to the number of times ""dax"" appears in the input, hinting that other words may also influence the output or that ""dax"" might have multiple representations.

Given these observations, the rule we can induce is:

For instance, in the second example, ""dax walm dax"" leads to a repetition of ""green"" until the next ""dax"" when it switches to ""red,"" which then repeats.

Based on this, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: ""dax"" precedes the word for a color and causes the color to repeat until a new color or new ""dax"" term appears.

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we will examine each instance of ""dax"" in the provided examples and observe the corresponding output.

1. In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
2. In the second example, ""dax"" appears four times and corresponds to ""green,"" ""green,"" ""red,"" and ""green"" respectively. If we notice the pattern, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" except in the case when it's immediately followed by ""wif,"" where it corresponds to ""red.""
3. In the third example, ""dax"" is immediately followed by ""walm"" and corresponds to ""green.""
4. In the fourth example, ""dax"" is sandwiched between ""zup"" and ""lug"" and corresponds to ""green.""
5. In the fifth example, ""dax"" is after ""wif"" and corresponds to ""green."" This contradicts the previous rule from the second example unless the rule for ""red"" requires ""dax"" to be both preceded and followed by ""wif.""

Comparing the examples where ""dax"" is not followed by ""wif,"" ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green."" When ""dax"" is both preceded and followed by ""wif,"" it corresponds to ""red."" However, this scenario occurs only once. To confirm the rule about ""wif,"" we would need more examples. Since there is only one instance where ""dax"" is directly followed by ""wif,"" we can speculate this changes ""dax"" to ""red,"" but it's not conclusive.

With the given data, the rule seems to be:

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to examine each input and the corresponding output:

1. Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
   Output: green green red blue yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""wif"" to red, ""lug"" to blue, and ""zup"" to yellow.

2. Input: dax walm wif bluf

   - ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""wif"" to red. Notice that ""walm"" seems to generate the same output color as the word before it.

3. Input: lug bluf wif

   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" to red.

4. Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf

5. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf

   - Following the pattern, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" to red, and ""walm"" takes the color of the previous word.

Notice that whenever ""bluf"" appears, the output color is always the same as the color corresponding to the word following ""bluf.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:
""bluf"" makes the next word in the input have its corresponding color output twice in a row.

Rule: bluf -> Causes the next word's color to be duplicated in the output sequence.",-6.220416681538001,48,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the correspondence between the inputs and the outputs:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows the pattern ""green green green,"" but the output instead shows ""red red,"" adding to the ""red"" that corresponds to ""wif."" This indicates that ""bluf"" might break the sequence of colors or interact with ""wif.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" directly corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" which is different from the previous instances. However, note that ""bluf"" is at the end, and it might refer to a repetition of the last color mentioned, which is ""yellow"" in this case.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" again, and it seems to repeat the color right before it, similar to the fourth example.

Considering these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" may mean ""repeat the previous color."" However, the second example complicates this rule because it involves a sequence of the same color followed by ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" is followed by two reds. Since the examples are not entirely consistent, we might consider an alternative interpretation where ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue,"" but certain conditions change this meaning.

Let's propose the following rule based on the majority of evidence:

Rule: ""bluf"" generally corresponds to repeating the color immediately prior to it except when in the sequence ""wif bluf,"" in which case it might alter the expected pattern.

So for most examples, except perhaps the second one, we could tentatively settle on:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning is to repeat the color immediately prior.",-8.3419957086,48,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look for patterns and consistencies in the examples. Let's examine each instance of ""bluf"" and their corresponding outputs:

1. In ""dax bluf wif lug zup,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
2. In ""dax walm wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" but appears twice in the output.
3. In ""lug bluf wif,"" ""bluf"" again corresponds to ""red.""
4. In ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" which is notably different from the previous results.
5. In ""lug walm wif lug bluf,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" but again appears twice in the output.

The key observations are:
- ""Bluf"" usually corresponds to ""red,"" but not always.
- When ""bluf"" doesn't correspond to ""red,"" it seems to take the color of the preceding word.
- It seems that ""bluf"" might result in a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that appears immediately before ""bluf.""

Based on the above observations, it seems that ""bluf"" causes a repetition of the word that comes before it. In cases where ""bluf"" is followed by a color word, it takes on the color value of that word as an exception. However, there is not enough information to determine this last rule conclusively. We need more examples to confirm.

Rule: bluf -> causes the previous color to be repeated in the output. If the previous color is not stated, default to ""red.""",-9.235671318094,48,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
   Output: green green red blue yellow
   
2. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red

3. Input: lug bluf wif
   Output: blue blue red

4. Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow

5. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

From examining the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

- In example 1, the word before ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" and after it is ""lug"". The colors go from red to blue after ""bluf"" is used.
- In example 2, ""bluf"" is the last word. After ""bluf"" is used, the color red repeats.
- In example 3, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" (otherwise the word before ""bluf"" almost identically), which changes from blue to red.
- In example 4, ""bluf"" is the last word and is preceded by ""zup,"" changing the last color to yellow.
- In example 5, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" similar to the first example, changing the color to blue.

By examining these patterns, we can see that ""bluf"" is not consistently associated with a particular color or set of colors. However, it does seem to influence the color output of the word that follows it—if there is a word following it. Given ""bluf"" is always followed by another color change, it suggests that ""bluf"" functions as a ""modifier"" that changes the color output of the subsequent word. 

However, without a consistent pattern to the color change and given that when ""bluf"" is the last word the color before it repeats (as in the second example), it's challenging to pin down an exact rule beyond ""bluf"" being some kind of modifier.

Based on the given examples, however, the most consistent rule we can infer is that ""bluf"" either triggers a color change or repeats the previous color if it is the last word. Given the varied nature of the color changes following ""bluf,"" we might tentatively conclude that ""bluf"" is context-dependent, and its specific effect could depend on the word it is paired with or the position it is in. Thus, the rule is not definite from the provided examples.

Rule: bluf -> Acts as a modifier for the color output, the effect of which depends on the context and is not a direct one-to-one mapping to a specific color.",-9.914761173894998,48,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns associated with each input and output.

- In inputs where ""dax"" is immediately followed by ""walm,"" such as ""dax walm,"" the output is ""green green green.""
- In the input ""dax wif walm,"" where ""wif"" is inserted between ""dax"" and ""walm,"" an additional ""red"" is inserted for each occurrence of ""wif."" Consequently, the output is ""green red red red.""
- In the third input, ""zup walm lug zup wif dax,"" we see that ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" which results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" ""Zup"" precedes ""walm"" and ""lug,"" and it maps to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" at the end results in another ""green.""
- The fourth input is the same as the first one, so the output is also the same: ""green green green.""
- Finally, the input ""wif lug dax walm"" maps to ""red blue,"" followed by the ""dax walm"" combination giving us ""green green green.""

From these patterns, we can infer the following rule: ""walm"" outputs ""green"" each time it appears in the sequence. However, the presence of other nonce words like ""wif"" changes the color sequence before ""walm"" is articulated in the output. 

Rule: ""walm"" translates to the sequence ""green green green,"" and other nonce words modify the outputs in different ways preceding this sequence.",-3.8522192847200003,48,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can observe the following:

1. `dax walm` always results in `green green green`.
2. When `wif` is present before `walm`, the output is always more characters and includes a `red` color, suggesting that `wif` may change the output when used in combination with `walm`.
3. When `lug` appears anywhere with regard to `walm`, `blue` is always a part of the output.
4. The presence of `zup` before `walm` does not maintain a consistent color output except for adding `yellow` every time `zup` is in the input.
5. `walm` on its own or following `dax` results in the output of repeating `green`.

From these observations, we could infer that `walm` generates the output `green green green` when it is not affected by preceding words that seem to modify its behavior or the output sequence.

Therefore, the rule for `walm` without considering modifiers might be:

**Rule: walm -> outputs `green green green`.**

However, because we have complex interactions with other words such as `wif`, `lug`, and `zup` that seem to modify the output, a more comprehensive rule accounting for the modifiers is not determinable without additional examples or information about the interactions of these words with `walm`.",-6.1436078396400005,48,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to carefully look at the patterns before and after the word ""walm"" in the examples given, and the respective outputs. Here's a breakdown of each example:

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

2. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red

3. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

5. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green

From these examples, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green."" When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is always ""green green green,"" regardless of whether ""walm"" occurs at the end of the sequence or between ""dax"" and another word. Therefore, ""walm"" seems to be a repetition signal for the color that precedes it, at least when it comes to ""dax."" 

However, we need to check its behavior with other colors to confirm this rule:

In the 3rd input, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" and the output is three times ""yellow,"" which seems to support the repetition rule suggested from the ""dax walm"" examples.

In the 5th input, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which again results in the repetition of ""green"" three times.

Based on these observations, the following rule can be induced for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color-indicating word, the output is the corresponding color repeated three times.

Therefore:
walm -> meaning. The rule is that ""walm"" causes the color word that precedes it to be repeated three times.",-6.807653175262,48,walm
"Based on the examples provided where ""walm"" is included, the outputs consistently contain multiple instances of ""green"" in a sequence. Each instance of the word ""walm"" contributes to three ""green"" in the output, regardless of the other words present or their order. The sequence of ""green"" in the output does not appear to be affected by the presence or position of ""dax,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" or ""zup"" in the input. Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> three consecutive instances of the word ""green"".",-9.27952594121,48,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the input-output pairs:

1. Input: dax walm             -> Output: green green green
2. Input: dax wif walm         -> Output: green red red red
3. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
4. Input: dax walm             -> Output: green green green
5. Input: wif lug dax walm     -> Output: red blue green green green

We know that the output color is based on the preceding word in some way. Since ""walm"" follows different words and results in different multiples of the same color in the output, we can try correlating the preceding word with the number of times that color appears:

- ""dax walm"" consistently results in ""green green green"" (three greens).
- When a single ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" there are four colors in the output, with red being the first color.
- ""zup walm"" in the third input results in three instances of yellow.
- In the last example, ""dax walm"" after ""wif lug"" results in three greens, even though different words precede ""dax.""

These observations can lead us to think ""walm"" might mean to repeat the color associated with the previous word a certain number of times. However, it seems overridden if there is a sequence of words before ""walm"" which changes the pattern of repetition. 

In the third example, we have ""walm"" occurring after ""zup"" and before ""lug,"" which results in three yellows. This suggests that ""walm"" maintains the repetition rule despite a word following it, but only if that word is ""lug,"" since ""lug"" does not immediately produce an output associated with it.

Let's focus on the instances of ""dax walm"" to find a rule, as this pattern is consistent and isolated:

""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""

In these instances, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" without any other words in between and the output is always three greens. Thus, we can begin to create a rule:

""Walm"" following ""dax"" results in three instances of ""green.""

Looking at the other examples where ""walm"" is not immediately preceded by ""dax,"" we see variations in the number of colors output. To establish the rule accurately, we need to also identify the significance of other words in the sequences, which we are not equipped to do with the given data. We will therefore focus on the rule associated with ""dax walm"" for the nonce definition.

Based on these observations, a possible rule:

- In the second example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and when ""bluf"" comes after, we have ""blue blue.""

- ""Dax lug dax"" leads to ""green blue green,"" indicating that ""lug"" caused ""blue"" to be in the middle, with ""dax"" maintaining its color ""green"" before and after.
- ""Lug wif lug"" outputs ""blue red blue,"" where ""lug"" on both ends dictates the color ""blue,"" coming from ""wif,"" despite ""wif"" providing a ""red"" color.

5. ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" becomes ""red yellow yellow red green"" which again would imply ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" in this position.

These results seem contradictory at first, as ""bluf"" seems to correspond to different colors in different instances. However, given that the output color matches the color stated immediately preceding ""bluf"" in each input, it seems likely that the rule for ""bluf"" is that it takes on the color of the preceding word or, when it's the first word, it duplicates its own corresponding color.

"Rule: The word ""bluf"" results in the output of a color that matches the color-name word immediately before ""bluf."" If there's no color-name word before ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""

Based on the examples:
1. ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
2. ""dax bluf zup"" becomes ""green green yellow,"" where ""dax"" is ""green,"" hence ""bluf"" is ""green,"" followed by ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
3. ""dax zup bluf"" becomes ""green yellow yellow,"" where ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (which is ""yellow"") with no previous color-word, so ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""

2. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" results in ""green blue blue blue yellow red."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" subsequent to ""lug.""

3. ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue""
4. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red green""
5. ""zup walm wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow red""

In each case, the color immediately before ""walm"" is repeated multiple times, and the number of repetitions corresponds to the number of instances of the word ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color. The repetition count is equal to the number of times ""walm"" appears consecutively.",-1.193648751412,50,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the relationship between the input and the corresponding output colors:

- ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
- ""dax lug walm zup wif"" -> ""green blue blue blue yellow red""
- ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue""
- ""zup lug walm wif dax"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red green""
- ""zup walm wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow red""

Considering the first and last examples, it appears that when ""walm"" is immediately followed by ""wif,"" the output for ""walm"" is the same color as ""wif"" (which is red). This happens regardless of whether ""wif"" is before or after ""walm.""

However, in the examples where ""walm"" is surrounded either by ""lug"" or a sequence of different words, its output is a sequence of four blue colors.

So, we can surmise that ""walm"" translates into a sequence of colors. Specifically, ""walm"" repeats the color of the immediately following word unless there is no word following it, in which case it outputs a sequence of four blue colors.

Rule: ""walm"" -> When followed by a word, it repeats the color of that word. Otherwise, it outputs four blue.",-1.210031399028,50,walm
"From the given examples, ""walm"" appears to produce a series of ""blue"" outputs that continue in a sequence until a different color output is produced by another word. The next color output seems to be determined by the word that breaks the ""walm"" sequence. For instance, when ""walm"" precedes ""wif,"" the ""walm"" sequence of blue ends with ""red"" from ""wif"". Similarly, when ""walm"" precedes ""dax,"" the sequence ends with ""green"" from ""dax.""

Let's see how this rule applies to each example:

Input: wif walm  
Output: red red red  
Explanation: ""wif"" generates ""red,"" followed by ""walm,"" which repeats the preceding color. Since ""walm"" is at the end with no word to break its sequence, it results in a continuous ""red red red"" output.

Input: dax lug walm zup wif  
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red  
Explanation: ""dax"" generates ""green,"" ""lug"" contributes the first ""blue,"" then ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" until the new color ""yellow"" from ""zup"" breaks the sequence, and finally ""wif"" gives ""red.""

Input: wif lug walm  
Output: red blue blue blue  
Explanation: ""wif"" generates ""red,"" ""lug"" gives the first ""blue,"" then ""walm"" continues with ""blue"" until the end.

Input: zup lug walm wif dax  
Output: yellow blue blue blue red green  
Explanation: ""zup"" generates ""yellow,"" ""lug"" gives the first ""blue,"" ""walm"" continues the blue sequence, ""wif"" interrupts with ""red,"" and ""dax"" ends it with ""green.""

Input: zup walm wif  
Output: yellow yellow yellow red  
Explanation: ""zup"" leads with ""yellow,"" ""walm"" continues with ""yellow"" until it is broken by ""wif,"" which outputs ""red.""

According to these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color output of the preceding word, creating a sequence of the same color until another word outputs a new color.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color output of the previous word until a new color is introduced by a subsequent word.",-4.543937893211,50,walm
"By examining the input-output pairs, we can look for patterns to define what ""walm"" means in this context.

In each output, the presence of ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color that directly precedes it in the input. For instance:

- In the first example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red""; ""walm"" causes the color red (associated with ""wif"") to repeat two more times.
- ""dax lug walm zup wif"" includes ""lug"" before ""walm,"" and the output repeats blue (which corresponds to ""lug"") three times before proceeding with the next colors.
- Similarly, ""wif lug walm"" results in ""red blue blue blue,"" with ""walm"" again causing the color blue to repeat.
- The sequence ""zup lug walm wif dax"" gives us ""yellow blue blue blue red green,"" where ""walm"" repeats the color before it, which is blue.
- Lastly, ""zup walm wif"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" where once more ""walm"" prompts the repetition of the color yellow associated with ""zup.""

Given these observations, the rule for ""walm"" can be described as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times in total.",-4.627241280514,50,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue every time it appears. Here's the analysis:

- In all instances, whenever the word 'lug' is used in the input, 'blue' is the output.
- It does not appear to depend on position or surrounding words, as it is always translated to 'blue' regardless of its location in the sequence or the words around it.
  
Therefore, the rule appears to be quite straightforward:

Rule: lug -> blue",-8.294416480248,51,lug

"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's match each input word with its corresponding output color and look for a pattern:

First Input/Output Pair:
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- bluf -> red

Second Input/Output Pair:
- lug -> blue

Fourth Input/Output Pair:
- dax -> green
- walm -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green

Fifth Input/Output Pair:
- wif -> red
- dax -> green

In every case, ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green"". It does not seem to matter what position ""dax"" is in or what other words are present; whenever ""dax"" is the input, ""green"" is the output. Therefore, we can conclude:

Rule: dax -> green",-5.465164515615999,51,dax
"Analyzing the given examples, it seems like ""dax"" should be a color because each time ""dax"" occurs, it corresponds to a color in the output. Now, let's try to figure out the pattern or rule.

1. In the first example:
Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
Output: yellow red green red red

Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"". ""Dax"" is surrounded by ""wif"" and ""bluf"", both of which correspond to ""red"", and ""dax"" gives ""green"".

2. In the second example:
Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
Output: blue red red green blue blue

Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""bluf"" to ""blue"". ""Dax"" occurs after ""bluf"" and ""before ""lug""; both are ""blue"", and ""dax"" gives ""green"".

3. In the third example:
Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""bluf"" to ""red"". ""Dax"" is between ""walm"" and ""wif"", where ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" gives ""green"".

4. In the fourth example:
Input: dax walm zup lug dax
Output: green green green yellow blue green

Here, ""dax"" is the first and last word; it corresponds to ""green"" both times. ""Walm"" corresponds to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"".

5. In the fifth example:
Input: wif dax
Output: red green

Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""dax"" follows it giving ""green"".

From these observations, the rule seems pretty straightforward. ""Dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" every time it appears in the input, regardless of its position or neighboring words.

Rule: dax -> green",-6.386726219755,51,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we need to analyze the output associated with the input sequences containing that word. Here's the information we have:

1. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow red green red red

2. Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
   Output: blue red red green blue blue

3. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

4. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green

5. Input: wif dax
   Output: red green

From the examples, it appears that ""dax"" may be associated with the color ""green."" To verify this, we look for consistencies in the presence of ""dax"" and the color ""green"":

1. Input contains ""dax"" –> Output includes ""green"" at the corresponding position(s)
2. Whenever ""dax"" appears as the first word in the input, the first word in the output is always ""green.""
3. Whenever ""dax"" appears after another word in the input, the corresponding word in the output directly after that word is ""green.""

By examining all the examples according to these notices, the rule seems consistent. Thus, we have identified the meaning behind the nonce word ""dax.""

Rule: dax -> green",-8.292239756028,51,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the inputs and corresponding outputs:

1. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow red green red red
   We have an instance of ""dax"" following ""wif"" and before another ""wif"" which translates to ""red green red""

2. Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
   Output: blue red red green blue blue
   Here, ""dax"" is between ""bluf"" and ""lug,"" translating to ""red green.""

3. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   ""dax"" is after ""walm"" and before ""wif bluf,"" which is ""green red red.""

4. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   Both instances of ""dax"" are followed by other words except for the last ""dax,"" which has nothing following.

5. Input: wif dax
   Output: red green
   Here, ""dax"" immediately follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red green.""

From the above, we can see that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green,"" irrespective of its position relative to other words. It can also be noted that it doesn't seem to matter what other words come before or after ""dax""; it consistently results in the color ""green."" Therefore, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: dax -> green. Meaning ""dax"" means ""green.""",-10.420378217904998,51,dax
Rule: dax -> green,-13.49402407044,51,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following corresponding outputs for each word:

- wif: red
- zup: yellow
- lug: blue
- dax: green
- walm: green, repeated for the number of letters in ""walm"" (4 letters, hence green is repeated 3 times)

It seems that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the word ""red.""

Now let’s check our hypothesis with the given examples:

Input: wif
Output: red

Input: zup wif zup
Output: yellow red yellow

Input: wif
Output: red

Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

The word ""walm"" is particularly interesting—it appears as ""green green green"" in the first instance and ""yellow yellow yellow"" in the second. The difference in output seems to be influenced by the word preceding ""walm"" which is ""dax"" in the first instance and ""zup"" in the second. This suggests another rule that the color output for ""walm"" depends on the color associated with the previous word: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and the number of repeated colors corresponds to the count of letters in ""walm,"" but since this is not consistent for ""wif,"" we maintain our conclusion that ""wif"" simply means ""red.""

"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the color outputs corresponding to each input sequence and attempt to deduce the pattern:

1. ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow green yellow green red red."" 
   The ""bluf"" at the end results in an additional ""red.""

2. ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" corresponds to ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue.""
   ""bluf"" after ""zup"" results in an extra ""yellow.""

3. ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue.""
   The ""bluf"" here simply repeats the color before it, which is ""blue.""

4. ""wif lug zup bluf"" corresponds to ""red blue yellow yellow.""
   ""bluf"" after ""zup"" again results in an extra ""yellow.""

5. ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" corresponds to ""yellow blue red green green red.""
   ""bluf"" after ""dax"" results in an extra ""green,"" and the ""wif"" that follows changes the sequence to ""red.""

From these observations, we can derive the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that comes immediately before it unless that word is ""dax,"" in which case ""bluf"" results in an additional ""green""; if ""wif"" follows ""bluf,"" it changes to ""red"" regardless of the previous color.

Thus, bluf -> meaning would be: ""bluf"" means repeat the color of the preceding word, with specific exceptions for when preceded by ""dax"" or followed by ""wif."" ",-1.086769577946,51,bluf
"Looking at the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color repeated twice in the output. The repetition of the color seems to depend on the color word that precedes ""bluf"". Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red.""
- In the second example, ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow.""
- In the third example, ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green.""

Additionally, without ""bluf"" in the sequence:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" causes the color word that comes immediately before it to be repeated in the output.

- In the first example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". Hence, ""bluf"" gives the output ""red red"".
- In the second example, ""zup"" comes before ""bluf"", and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". Thus, ""bluf"" yields ""yellow"".
- In the third example, ""lug"" is right before ""bluf"", so ""lug"" is ""blue"", and ""bluf"" results in the output ""blue"".
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" is before ""bluf"", so ""zup"" is ""yellow"", producing ""yellow"" for ""bluf"".
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""dax"" comes before ""bluf"", and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". Therefore, ""bluf"" outputs ""green"".

Rule: bluf -> the color of the word immediately preceding it.",-4.53539015138,51,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look for a pattern in each example:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" correlates with a double ""red.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" correlates with a single ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" correlates with a double ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" correlates with a double ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" correlates with a single ""green.""

""Bluf"" does not have a single consistent color correlation. Instead, it seems to indicate that the word that follows ""bluf"" (if any) should be repeated in the output sequence. When ""bluf"" is at the end of an input sequence, the color before ""bluf"" is repeated. When ""bluf"" appears in the middle of a sequence, the color that corresponds to the word immediately following ""bluf"" is repeated. This suggests that ""bluf"" may function like a command for repetition.

Rule: bluf -> Indicates repetition of the color associated with the word that follows it in the sequence, or if it's the last word, repetition of the last mentioned color. If ""bluf"" is followed by a new word (color), that color is repeated once. If ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence, the previous color is repeated twice.",-9.0942913104,51,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> when ""bluf"" is mentioned, repeat the color corresponding to the last word said before ""bluf"". If ""bluf"" is said at the beginning without a preceding color-associated word, assume the color mentioned last in the previous statement. If ""bluf"" appears at the beginning of the first statement, treat it as blue based on the available data.

For instance:
- In ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"", the word before ""bluf"" is ""wif"", which outputs red. Therefore, bluf outputs red.
- In ""zup lug zup bluf lug"", the word before ""bluf"" is ""zup"", which outputs yellow. Therefore, bluf outputs yellow.
- In ""lug bluf"", the word before ""bluf"" is ""lug"", which outputs blue. Therefore, bluf outputs blue.
- In ""wif lug zup bluf"", the word before ""bluf"" is ""zup"", which outputs yellow. Therefore, bluf outputs yellow.
- In ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"", the word before ""bluf"" is ""dax"", which outputs green. Therefore, bluf outputs green.",-9.883821615479999,51,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" is associated with the repetition of the color that immediately precedes it, repeated three times. Each unique word (e.g., ""zup,"" ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""wif"") seems to translate to a specific color:

- ""zup"" translates to yellow.
- ""dax"" translates to green.
- ""lug"" translates to blue.
- ""wif"" translates to red.

When ""walm"" follows any of these words, the output is the color corresponding to the word preceding ""walm,"" repeated three times. 

- After ""zup"" (yellow), ""walm"" results in ""red red red.""
- After ""dax"" (green), ""walm"" results in ""green green green.""
- After ""lug"" (blue), ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue.""
- After ""wif"" (red), ""walm"" results in ""red red red.""

It is important to note that the rule could also be that ""walm"" transforms the word before it into three copies of its corresponding color. However, since ""wif"" is the only fourth word in the list that directly precedes ""walm"" and ""wif"" has only ever been followed by ""red,"" the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the previous color regardless of what that color is.

"Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following rule about the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"":

- Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, the corresponding output colors are repeated three times.

To break it down:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" The output is ""red"" repeated three times.
2. In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" The output is ""green"" repeated three times.
3. The third example again shows that ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue."" The output is ""blue"" repeated three times.
4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and the output is ""red"" repeated three times, followed by ""lug,"" which corresponds to a single ""blue.""
5. In the last example, the pattern deviates slightly, with ""walm"" following ""dax,"" corresponding to ""green"" and being repeated twice because ""walm"" appears twice, separated by ""zup"" and ""lug,"" which correspond to ""yellow"" and ""blue"" respectively. The pattern that ""walm"" entails three repetitions of the color preceding it is consistent.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: walm -> The preceding color is repeated three times.",-6.0631778663599984,51,walm
"From the examples provided and the associated outputs for each input, we can deduce a pattern for what ""walm"" signifies. 

Considering each individual example:

1. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Analysis: Without ""walm,"" the input would correspond to ""yellow red."" Therefore, adding ""walm"" results in two additional instances of ""red.""

2. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red
   Analysis: Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" after ""dax"" adds two more ""green."" The rest of the sequence matches the known colors for ""zup"" (yellow) and ""wif"" (red).

3. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Analysis: ""Dax lug"" corresponds to ""green blue,"" and the presence of ""walm"" again adds two more instances of ""blue.""

4. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue

5. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   Analysis: ""Dax walm"" leads to triple ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and the final ""walm"" triples the ""blue.""

Based on the above examples, the rule that can be deduced for ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule:
""Walm"" appears to triple the color output of the word preceding it. If ""zup"" is before ""walm,"" which by itself corresponds to ""yellow,"" it will result in three ""yellow"" outputs. Similarly, if ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" corresponding to ""green,"" it will result in three ""green"" outputs, and ""lug"" before ""walm,"" corresponding to ""blue,"" will result in three ""blue"" outputs.

The key to determining the color related to each input word can be seen in the context of each example provided. The outputs are consistently associated with the word preceding ""walm"".

Here is the breakdown:

1. ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green green green red"" suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
2. ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green"" suggests ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"".
3. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"" again suggests ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
4. ""zup walm dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green"" suggests ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
5. ""zup wif walm lug"" -> ""yellow red red red blue"" suggests ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Based on this analysis, we could formulate the following rule:

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" is encountered, it means to repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.

Therefore:
walm -> Repeat the color indicated by the preceding word three times.",-1.230406016382,53,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" from the examples given:

- In the first example, the presence of ""walm"" correlates with three repetitions of the color associated with the word that follows ""walm."" Following ""walm,"" the word ""wif"" results in ""red,"" so we see ""green green green red.""

- The second example follows a similar pattern: ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green."" Here, ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" and ""dax"" with ""green."" The ""walm"" again precedes a triplet of the color associated with the word ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

- Again, in the third example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" reinforcing the idea that ""walm"" results in a triplet of the color associated with the following word.

- The fourth and fifth examples further reinforce this pattern.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

walm -> Repetition of a color associated with the following word, repeating that color three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" is followed by a word, it changes the output to three instances of whatever color the following word is associated with before continuing with the normal color pattern.",-3.9349040715999997,53,walm
"To figure out the rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" we will look for patterns in the input and corresponding output.

Looking at the examples, each instance of the word ""walm"" is followed by a color pattern that repeats three times in the Output.

1. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   Here, ""walm"" is followed by three greens.

2. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   Here, ""walm"" is followed by three yellows.

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Here, ""walm"" is followed by three blues.

4. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   Here, ""walm"" is followed by three yellows.

5. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   Here, ""walm"" is followed by three reds.

Looking at these examples, it seems that ""walm"" indicates the repetition of the color that corresponds to the preceding word three times.

For instance:
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" the color green is repeated three times.
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" the color yellow is repeated three times.
- When ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" the color blue is repeated three times.

So the rule seems to be that the output for ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"" three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",-6.266545012417001,53,walm
"Rule:

Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" causes the word that follows it to repeat its associated color three times. In each instance, the word after ""walm"" produces a triplet of the same color before returning to the standard color pattern for subsequent words. Here is the analysis:

- In the first example, ""wif"" follows ""walm"" and yields ""green green green."" Normally, ""wif"" just results in ""red.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" follows ""walm,"" producing ""blue blue blue."" Normally, ""lug"" alone results in ""blue.""

2. ""lug zup dax wif"" likewise translates to ""blue yellow green red,"" where zup is the second word and yellow is the second color. This supports the idea that zup corresponds to yellow, especially since the other words are consistently translated (lug -> blue, dax -> green, wif -> red).

Illustrative Examples:
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- ""zup wif walm lug"" results in ""yellow red red red blue"" because ""wif"" is not associated with a color, thus ""walm"" causes the immediately preceding word ""wif"" to output as ""red"" three times, followed by the color corresponding to ""lug"", which is blue.
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""dax walm zup lug"" results in ""green green green yellow blue"" because ""walm"" makes ""dax"" (green) repeat three times, followed by ""zup"" giving yellow and ""lug"" giving blue.
- ""lug walm"" again results in ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to blue.

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

In examples 1 and 5, the inputs are identical, so it's not surprising that the outputs are also the same (""blue blue blue"").

The word ""walm"" is the second word in each of these examples and also the second word in the series of the output color repetition. It seems that ""walm"" might influence the number of color repetitions.

In example 2, ""walm"" occurs after ""zup"" and ""wif,"" and before ""lug."" The output shows that ""yellow"" appears once, ""red"" appears three times, and then ""blue"" occurs once. There isn't an immediate clear pattern based on ""walm"" since there's a mix of different colored repetitions preceding and following ""walm,"" but it does appear in the second position in both the input and output.

In example 3, ""zup walm"" appears as the input, with ""yellow yellow yellow"" being the output. Since ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is three repetitions of ""yellow,"" it could indicate ""zup"" dictates the color and ""walm"" may specify the number of repetitions.

In example 4, ""walm"" is sandwiched between ""dax"" and ""zup,"" with the output showing repeating ""green"" (which is the color associated with ""dax"") followed by a single occurrence of ""yellow"" and ""blue."" The number of repetitions (three) corresponds to the number of colors that appear before ""zup.""

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" indicates the repetition of the color that correlates to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" The color repeats as many times as the position in which ""walm"" appears in the sequence (second place in the input leads to two repetitions, third place leads to three repetitions, etc.).

For ""wif zup dax bluf"", the output is ""red yellow green green"". If we hold onto our initial conclusion that ""bluf"" correlates with \""red\"" and now see it correlating with ""green"", it appears there is no one-to-one word-color correlation for ""bluf"". Also, ""wif"" results in ""red"" again here, suggesting it consistently corresponds to ""red"".

For ""dax walm wif"", the output is ""green green green red"". We have ""wif"" at the end, directly translating to ""red"", further reinforcing that ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red"".

For ""wif dax lug dax"", the output is ""red green blue green"". Here ""wif"" is ""red"" once more, and ""dax"" appears to have different outputs (""green"" and ""blue""), indicating that the meaning of ""dax"" might vary based on its position or other words in the sequence.

For ""zup wif"", the output is ""yellow red"". ""Wif"" is again corresponding with ""red"". Since this is consistent across all examples, it supports the idea that ""wif"" translates directly to ""red"".

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can analyze the sequences provided and compare the inputs with the corresponding outputs. We look for patterns that apply specifically when ""walm"" is introduced. 

In the first input, ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" and before ""wif lug dax walm"" again. The output starts with a series of three greens followed by red, suggesting that ""dax walm"" may translate to ""green green"". The sequence ends with ""green green green"", echoing the start, once again following ""dax walm."" This suggests a repetition rule.

In the second input, ""walm"" is between ""zup"" and ""lug zup wif dax."" The corresponding output colors shift from three yellows to blue, and then to a single yellow and red green, so there's not a clear pattern solely from this input.

The third input features ""wif zup walm dax zup,"" and the output changes from red, two yellows to green, yellow. Notably, when ""zup"" is next, the color yellow is consistently present, except where ""walm"" is used.

In the fourth input, ""walm"" appears between ""wif"" and ""dax zup."" Both ""wif"" and ""dax"" relate to red and green in the outputs, but the presence of ""walm"" changes the sequence to two reds and a green, suggesting a transformation effect by ""walm.""

The fifth input has ""walm"" after ""dax"" and followed by ""zup."" The output pattern changes at ""walm"" from red and green to a sequence of greens and a yellow, which again seems to signify a transformation or continuation.

Given these observations, we can see a pattern that ""walm"" tends to influence the sequence that follows it by either repeating a certain color sequence or altering it significantly.

""Walm"" seems to be functioning as a modifier that affects the color output right after its occurrence, potentially replicating the color immediately before it or causing a string of repeated colors. However, the exact rule is not entirely clear given the variability in the associated outputs.

Based on the patterns observed, we could conceive a tentative rule that ""walm"" replicates or sustains the output color pattern that precedes it. However, this rule isn't consistent across all examples and does not account for all the changes observed, particularly when considering the second input.

Therefore, we need more data to come up with a definitive rule. With the limited examples provided, the best we have is a partial rule:

Rule: ""walm"" seems to induce a repeating color sequence in the output, but the specifics of this effect are not clearly defined in every case.",-10.64282598868,55,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine its use in different contexts and the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green

   We notice that the words ""dax"" and ""walm"" are both followed by green. Since ""dax"" results in the output ""green,"" we can suspect that ""walm"" might also mean ""green"" or trigger the output ""green.""

2. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

   Here, ""zup"" results in yellow and directly after ""walm,"" the output is also yellow, similar to the pattern above with ""dax"" and ""walm.""

3. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

   In this example, ""walm"" is between ""zup"" which outputs yellow and ""dax"" which outputs green, and the output for ""walm"" is also yellow.

4. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

   ""Walm"" follows ""wif"" which results in red, but ""walm"" itself results in red, breaking the pattern from before if we thought ""walm"" resulted in the output of the preceding word.

5. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow

   Here, after ""dax"" we have ""walm,"" which are both followed by green. Again, pointing to the possibility that ""walm"" may also mean ""green.""

Taking into account all examples, one pattern that consistently holds is that the output for ""walm"" is ""green,"" regardless of the context. Therefore, we can deduce:

walm -> meaning: ""green"".

Rule: The presence of the word ""walm"" in the input results in the color ""green"" in the output.",-10.672391477489,55,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can look at its position relative to other words and the corresponding color in the output. Let's examine the instances of ""walm"":

1. ""dax walm wif"" -> green green green
2. ""zup walm lug"" -> yellow yellow yellow
3. ""wif zup walm"" -> red yellow yellow yellow
4. ""wif walm dax"" -> red red red
5. ""dax walm zup"" -> green green green yellow

We notice that whenever ""walm"" is preceded by a word, the output color matches the color of the word that precedes ""walm."" Hence ""walm"" seems to act as a duplicator or repeater of the color of the word before it. Let's formulate this observation into a rule:

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word.",-11.270799827919998,55,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the outputs in relation to the position of ""walm"" and the other words around it. 

In every instance where ""walm"" appears, the output that follows is ""green."" Also, notice that ""dax"" consistently results in green when it appears before or after ""walm"", but red when it appears without ""walm"" preceding it. Similarly, ""zup"" yields yellow regardless of its position except when it follows ""walm,"" which then also results in green. The term ""lug"" is associated with blue except when it precedes ""walm,"" again leading to green. Lastly, ""wif"" seems to produce red, except for when ""walm"" comes after, in which case ""walm"" still yields green.

From this pattern, it would appear that ""walm"" is a modifier that changes the color associated with the following word to green, irrespective of what that color would typically be.

Rule: walm -> changes the color attribute of the following word to green.",-12.220409976706,55,walm
"Looking at the pattern of colors output for each example, ""walm"" seems to change the color of the previous word in the input sequence. Here is the observed pattern:

1. 'dax' alone becomes green, but when preceded by 'walm', it remains red.
2. 'zup' alone becomes yellow, but when preceded by 'walm', it becomes green.
3. 'wif' alone becomes red, when preceded by 'walm', it stays red (since red is not followed by a color in the outputs, we can't tell if 'walm' has an effect).
4. 'lug' alone becomes blue, but when preceded by 'walm', it turns green.

From these observations, it seems ""walm"" changes the previous word's color to green, unless the original color is red, in which case ""walm"" has no effect. This can also be deduced from the lack of double 'walm' in any input which would have allowed us to see the effect of 'walm' on a 'walm' clause.

1. In the first example, ""wif"" is followed by ""dax"" which correlates with the transition from red to green in the output.

2. The second example also shows ""wif"" preceding ""dax"" and the color red preceding the color green. ""wif"" comes after ""lug,"" and the color red follows blue, but this might not be related.

3. The third example has ""wif"" followed by nothing but connected with the output red. This suggests that ""wif"" by itself corresponds to red.

4. Similarly, in the fourth example, ""wif"" is again followed by nothing and the output is red. This example also reinforces the idea that ""wif"" itself corresponds to red.

- Where ""bluf"" appears twice adjacently, as in ""dax bluf,"" the output is ""green green,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" might mean ""green"" in this context.
- However, in the third example ""dax zup bluf,"" the output is ""green yellow yellow,"" providing a contradiction if ""bluf"" were to only mean ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax bluf wif zup wif,"" the Output sequence has ""green"" repeated after ""dax"" and not after ""bluf"" alone, suggesting that ""bluf"" might not be ""green"" here but rather causing a repetition of the previous color.
- The fifth example, ""wif lug bluf wif zup,"" shows ""red blue blue red yellow,"" where ""bluf"" is again followed by a color that appeared right before it (""blue"").

From these observations, a pattern emerges where ""bluf"" seems to make the previous word's output be repeated. So, ""bluf"" causes repetition of the color output associated with the word right before it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color output of the previous word.",-4.6449608626400005,56,bluf
"Analyzing the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the rule for ""bluf"". To do this, let's see the position and repetition of ""bluf"" in different inputs and how it affects the output.

1. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug 
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue 
   Observation: ""bluf"" appears after ""zup"" and the corresponding output is ""yellow"", while ""lug"" after ""bluf"" generates ""blue"".

2. Input: dax bluf 
   Output: green green 
   Observation: ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and both are translated to ""green"".

3. Input: dax zup bluf 
   Output: green yellow yellow 
   Observation: ""bluf"" is again producing ""yellow"" after ""zup"". The presence of ""dax"" doesn't affect the output for ""bluf"".

4. Input: dax bluf wif zup wif 
   Output: green green red yellow red 
   Observation: ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", and ""bluf"" again corresponds to ""green"". ""Wif"" seems to translate to ""red"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". 

5. Input: wif lug bluf wif zup 
   Output: red blue blue red yellow 
   Observation: Following ""lug"", ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" here, and it remains ""blue"" even with ""wif"" following it.

From these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" can correspond to two different colors: ""green"" and ""yellow"" when following ""zup"", and ""green"" and ""blue"" when following ""lug"" or ""dax"". However, we notice that when ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", it always outputs ""green"". When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", it outputs ""yellow"".

Therefore, we can formulate the following rule: 

""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" when following ""dax"" and ""yellow"" when following ""zup"". In the case where ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", since it is not immediately clear if there is a consistent behavior from the given examples alone, the rule for it cannot be definitively determined.

Rule: 
bluf -> ""green"" when preceded by ""dax"".
bluf -> ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup"".
bluf -> The rule for ""bluf"" when preceded by ""lug"" cannot be determined from the given examples.",-6.040926125236,56,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the examples given and look for a pattern.

In the first example, the output sequence ends with ""blue blue blue yellow"" and the input sequence ends with ""lug walm zup."" Here ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" seems to cause the previous color (""blue"" from ""lug"") to repeat before then changing to ""yellow"" corresponding to ""zup.""

In the second example, we have an output of ""blue blue blue green"" corresponding to ""lug walm dax"". Again, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes a repetition of ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

In the third example, the output ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"" corresponds to ""zup bluf lug zup walm."" We don't know what ""bluf"" corresponds to, but it does not seem related to ""walm."" After ""lug"" (""blue""), ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is followed by ""walm,"" which leads to a repetition of ""yellow.""

In the fourth and fifth examples, we see that after ""lug"" and ""dax"" (which corresponds to ""blue"" and ""green"" respectively), ""walm"" causes a repetition of the previous color before the sequence changes.

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the previous color to be repeated once more in the sequence, regardless of what that color is. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> repeat the previous color in the sequence.",-4.872594397,56,walm
"Given the examples provided, the term ""walm"" seems to affect the color output associated with the following word. The pattern suggests that when ""walm"" precedes another word whose color is known, the color that follows is the same as that known color, creating a repetition. 

Let's break down the examples:

1. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   Analysis: ""walm"" comes before the second ""zup,"" and the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow) is repeated.

2. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   Analysis: ""walm"" comes before ""dax,"" and the color associated with ""dax"" (green) comes at the end after two ""blue"" which is the color for ""lug"".

3. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   Analysis: ""walm"" comes after the second ""zup,"" and the output is another ""yellow,"" consistent with the color for ""zup.""

4. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue
   Analysis: ""walm"" comes before ""lug,"" and the color associated with ""lug"" (blue) comes at the end after three ""green"" which is the color for ""dax"".

5. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   Analysis: ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" and multiple ""blue"" are in the output, consistent with the color for ""lug.""

Based on the pattern observed in these examples, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the color of the next known word to be repeated or extended in the sequence before it reverts back to the pattern set by the preceding words.

Rule:
walm -> When ""walm"" precedes a known color word, the output repeats that known color.",-5.165042652824001,56,walm
"Based on the given examples, we need to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"". To deduce this, let's look at the patterns before and after ""walm"" appears in each example:

1. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   - Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and is followed by ""zup"" (yellow).
   
2. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   - ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and is followed by ""dax"" (green).
   
3. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""Walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and is the last word.
   
4. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue
   - ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) and is followed by ""lug"" (blue).

5. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   - ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and is the last word.

From the examples, we can see that ""walm"" is always followed by the color name that corresponds to the word just before it when a word follows ""walm"". In the cases where ""walm"" is the last word, the output color repeats the last mentioned color. Based on this pattern, we can conclude:

walm -> meaning: ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it. If ""walm"" is the last word in the input, it repeats the last mentioned color.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, it outputs the same color as that word. If no word follows ""walm,"" repeat the last mentioned color.",-5.880309636553999,56,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds directly to the color ""blue."" Each time ""walm"" is mentioned in the input, ""blue"" is in the exact same position in the output. Furthermore, despite the varying positions of ""walm"" and the presence of different words around it, its meaning remains consistent throughout all examples. This suggests that ""walm"" is not context-dependent but rather has a fixed meaning.

Rule: walm -> blue.",-9.42115197384,56,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to the word ""blue"" when the word ""lug"" immediately precedes ""walm."" When ""walm"" follows any other word beside ""lug,"" it corresponds to the word ""yellow."" Here is the rule derived from the examples:

Rule: walm -> ""blue"" if preceded by ""lug,"" otherwise ""yellow"".",-9.790339191270002,56,walm

Input: lug -> Output: blue
Input: dax walm zup lug dax -> Output: green green green yellow blue green
Input: lug zup -> Output: blue yellow
Input: lug wif zup wif walm -> Output: blue red yellow red red red

By examining the outputs for each input instance, the one consistent element is that whenever ""lug"" appears, the first output color is ""blue.""

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to a color in the output, but the color it corresponds to depends on the position of ""zup"" and the colors or words adjacent to it. Let's analyze the instances:

1. In the first example, ""zup"" appears twice:
   - When ""zup"" is at the beginning and followed by ""dax lug walm zup,"" the output is ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow."" Here, the presence of ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"" both at the beginning and at the end.
   
2. In the second example, ""zup"" is second in sequence and is followed immediately by ""wif bluf lug."" The output is ""green yellow red red blue,"" with ""yellow"" corresponding to the position of ""zup"" in the sequence.

3. In the third example, ""zup"" is the first word and is followed by ""bluf dax,"" yielding the output ""yellow yellow green."" Once again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

4. In the fourth example, ""zup"" appears in the middle of the sequence with a ""wif"" after it, and the output is ""blue red yellow red red red."" ""Zup"" aligns with ""yellow"" in the output, but the repetition of ""red"" at the end seems anomalous and might be due to the presence of ""walm,"" which apparently corresponds to multiple ""reds.""

5. In the last example, ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" and the entire output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" with ""zup"" first in sequence connecting with ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, the common rule appears to be that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" but the conditions of adjacent words and their corresponding colors in the output are not entirely clear as the examples only show the output as consistently ""yellow"" when ""zup"" is used.

Rule: zup -> yellow

However, without further examples or a clearer pattern of interaction with the other words (""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" ""bluf""), this rule cannot fully explain the color repetitions or the conditions under which they occur. Hence, the rule that can be confidently induced from the given examples is that the use of ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" at that specific position in the sequence.",-0.8507744564940001,57,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the word ""zup"" appears to depend on the surrounding context, as follows:

1. When ""zup"" is followed by a different word, the output is ""yellow"" followed by a color corresponding to the following word.
2. When ""zup"" is followed by itself or not followed by any word, the output is a repetition of ""yellow"".
3. When ""zup"" is preceded and followed by the same word, ""zup"" produces the same color output as the word bracketing it.

Let's test the rule with the examples given:

Input: zup dax lug walm zup
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
- ""zup"" before ""dax"" gives ""yellow"".
- ""zup"" after ""walm"" and before ""zup"" gives ""blue"".
- The last ""zup"" has no following word, so it gives ""yellow"".

Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
Output: green yellow red red blue
- ""zup"" after ""dax"" and before ""wif"" gives ""yellow"".

Input: zup bluf dax
Output: yellow yellow green
- ""zup"" before ""bluf"" gives ""yellow"".

Input: lug wif zup wif walm
Output: blue red yellow red red red
- ""zup"" between two ""wif""s gives ""yellow"".

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""zup"" has no following word, thus it generates ""yellow"" repeatedly.

Based on these observations, we can conclude:

zup -> meaning: ""zup"" means ""yellow"" when it precedes a word. If ""zup"" follows a different word, it assumes the color output of that word unless it is followed by a word different from the preceding word, in which case it again means ""yellow"". If ""zup"" is at the end of a sequence or repeated with no other words following, it means ""yellow"" repeatedly.",-5.464851801467999,57,zup
"Based on the examples, it appears that the word 'zup' corresponds to the color mentioned immediately before it in the sequence. If there is no color mentioned before it (meaning it is the first in the sequence), 'zup' takes the color mentioned after it. In other words, 'zup' repeats the preceding color or, if it is at the start, it repeats the following color. Here are the deductions:

1. In ""zup dax lug walm zup"", 'zup' at the beginning has no preceding color, therefore it takes the color of ""dax"" which is green. The second 'zup' repeats the color before it, which is ""walm"" (blue).

2. In ""dax zup wif bluf lug"", 'zup' takes the color of ""dax"" which is green.

3. In ""zup bluf dax"", the 'zup' at the beginning has no preceding color, so it takes the color after it, which is ""bluf"" (yellow). 

4. In ""lug wif zup wif walm"", 'zup' repeats the color of ""wif"" which comes before it (red).

5. In ""zup walm"", 'zup' at the beginning has no preceding color, so it repeats the color following it, which is ""walm"" (yellow).

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" means ""yellow."" However, there is another pattern observed where ""zup"" causes all the following words to also translate to ""yellow"" until a new color word is introduced, which then becomes the new color for the following words until the next ""zup"" or another color word.

Thus, the rule for ""zup"" seems to be that it sets a color pattern to ""yellow"" for all the subsequent words until a different color is mentioned.

Rule: zup -> sets the color pattern to ""yellow"" for the following words until a new color word appears.",-9.74002440144,57,zup
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" However, the color output changes based on the presence and position of ""zup"" in the input sequence. The rule seems to be context-dependent.

In the provided examples, when ""zup"" appears, it affects not only its own output but also the color output for the word immediately following it (if there is one) in the sequence. The following word takes on the same color as ""zup,"" which is ""yellow."" This effect does not extend beyond the next word, as seen in the examples where subsequent words revert to their original color mappings.

Let's analyze the examples:

- In the first example, ""zup"" is followed by ""dax,"" and both output ""yellow."" The sequence ends with ""zup,"" outputting ""yellow"" again.
- In the second example, ""dax"" follows ""zup"" and both output ""yellow,"" even though ""dax"" usually outputs ""green.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and both output ""yellow,"" even though ""bluf"" usually outputs ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" influences the word immediately following it, ""wif,"" to output ""yellow,"" with the rest of the sequence following their usual color outputs.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and outputs ""yellow,"" despite usually outputting ""blue.""

From these observations, we can infer that ""zup"" has the effect of making itself and the next word in the sequence (if any) output the color ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule induced from these examples is:

Here are the observations:

1. When ""bluf"" appears, the word ""yellow"" always follows, except when ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug,"" in which case the output is ""blue blue.""
2. ""bluf"" never corresponds to ""green"" or ""red"" in the output.
3. In the third example, ""dax zup bluf,"" both ""dax"" and ""zup"" are followed by ""yellow,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" generates ""yellow"" as well.
4. The fourth example is interesting as ""lug"" usually corresponds to ""blue,"" but when it's followed by ""bluf,"" the output is not ""blue yellow"" but ""blue blue."" Therefore, when ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" it takes on the color associated with ""lug.""
5. The output sequence features twice the amount of yellow whenever ""bluf"" is present, suggesting that ""bluf"" might cause a repetition of the color word preceding it, except when preceded by ""lug,"" where ""bluf"" seems to adopt the preceding color word.

Based on these observations, we can infer the following rule for the meaning of ""bluf"":

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows any word except ""lug,"" the associated color word (from the input word preceding ""bluf"") is repeated in the output; when ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue,"" signaling that ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with ""lug,"" which is blue.

Rule:
The word 'bluf' translates to the color 'yellow', as observed consistently across all examples provided.",-9.959049740980001,57,bluf
"Based on the examples, we can infer that each input word corresponds to a color in the output. The word 'dax' consistently corresponds to 'green', and 'wif' corresponds to 'red'. When the word 'walm' appears after 'dax', the output is a repetition of 'green' followed by a 'red'. When 'walm' appears at the end of a sequence after 'zup', it results in repeating the color associated with 'zup' ('yellow' in this case).

Let's look at each example:

1. Input: dax walm wif
   - 'dax' -> 'green'
   - 'walm' -> repeated 'green'
   - 'wif' -> 'red'
   Output: green green green red

2. Input: wif dax zup walm
   - 'wif' -> 'red'
   - 'dax' -> 'green'
   - 'zup' -> 'yellow'
   - 'walm' -> repeated 'yellow' (after 'zup')
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

3. Input: dax walm
   - 'dax' -> 'green'
   - 'walm' -> repeated 'green'
   Output: green green green

4. Input: dax zup walm wif
   - 'dax' -> 'green'
   - 'zup' -> 'yellow'
   - 'walm' -> repeated 'yellow' (after 'zup')
   - 'wif' -> 'red'
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

5. Input: dax walm
   - 'dax' -> 'green'
   - 'walm' -> repeated 'green'
   Output: green green green

Therefore, the rule for 'walm' seems to be: when it follows 'dax', it repeats the output for 'dax'. When it follows 'zup', it repeats the output for 'zup'. It could be that 'walm' causes the previous color to be repeated with 'green' being the default if 'walm' is the second word. If 'walm' comes at the end of an input, the same logic applies, with the preceding color being repeated until the end of the output, before 'wif' which turns it to 'red'.

Based on this analysis, the rule can be summarized as follows:

Rule: When 'walm' follows 'dax', it repeats the output color for 'dax' ('green'). When 'walm' follows 'zup', it repeats the output color for 'zup' ('yellow'). When 'walm' is followed by 'wif', it ends with 'red'.",-3.152326998038,57,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the single word ""walm"" is associated with a repeat of the color that precedes it. Given that each instance of ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" we can deduce that ""walm"" repeats the color indicated by the word immediately before it, and it does so two additional times (a triplet of colors). The presence of ""wif"" after ""dax walm"" changes the output sequence to include ""red"" at the end, signifying that ""wif"" likely represents the color red, rather than having ""walm"" influence what color is associated with ""wif.""

For example, the sequence ""dax walm wif"" gives us ""green green green red,"" where ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated twice more, and ""wif"" translates to ""red."" Similarly, when ""zup"" is introduced before ""walm,"" such as in ""wif dax zup walm,"" we see a sequence where ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"" and ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to repeat twice more, resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Moreover, it seems that ""walm"" only influences the color that directly precedes it, and has no visible impact on any color or word that follows.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns in the given examples.

From the first example:
Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
- ""dax"" is followed by three greens, and ""wif"" by one red.

From the second example:
Input: wif dax zup walm
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
- ""wif"" leads to red, ""dax"" to green, and ""zup"" to one yellow, but there are two additional yellows after ""walm.""

From the third example:
Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- ""dax"" is the only word before ""walm"" and it leads to three greens, indicating again that ""dax"" correlates with the green and the repetition might be because of ""walm.""

From the fourth example:
Input: dax zup walm wif
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
- Each instance of ""dax"" and ""zup"" corresponds to the same colors as in previous inputs, but once again ""walm"" seems to multiply the preceding color (in this case, yellow).

From the fifth example:
Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- This example reiterates the pattern seen in the first and third instances, where ""dax"" is followed by three greens.

Based on these observations, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color that corresponds to the immediately preceding word to be repeated multiple times. The number of repetitions might be dependent on a rule we haven't entirely deduced from the given examples, but it seems consistent that there's at least a repetition of the color tied to the word before ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the word immediately preceding it to be repeated multiple times.",-5.634115331337001,57,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to the output of three green responses followed by a non-green response (red or yellow). However, further analysis shows that the non-green response only occurs when the word ""wif"" follows ""walm""; otherwise, no non-green response is given. 

Here is a breakdown:

- In the first example, ""walm"" appears before ""wif,"" and the output is three green followed by a red.
- In the second example, ""walm"" is at the end and does not precede ""wif,"" resulting only in yellow responses, matching the number of colors with the count of remaining words and ""walm"" itself.
- The third example does not have ""wif"" following ""walm"" and results only in green responses.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" precedes ""wif"" again and yields a similar pattern to the first example, three green followed by a red.
- The fifth example repeats the scenario of the third, with ""walm"" not followed by ""wif,"" resulting in green responses only.

Based on this, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" generates a pattern of three greens. If the word ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" an additional red follows the greens; otherwise, if there's no ""wif"" after ""walm"" or no further context is provided, no red ensues.

Rule: wif -> red,-8.91042037922,58,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" let's examine how it is used in various inputs and the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax 
   Output: red red yellow red blue green
   (""zup"" follows ""bluf"" and precedes ""wif""; its output is ""yellow"".)

2. Input: zup dax lug walm zup 
   Output: yellow green blue blue yellow 
   (""zup"" starts and ends the sequence here, with corresponding ""yellow"" at both positions.)

3. Input: zup bluf wif bluf

4. Input: dax zup

5. Input: lug zup

In every instance where ""zup"" appears, regardless of the position or the terms it is associated with, the corresponding output is ""yellow"".

Therefore,

"Based on the provided examples, it appears the rule relating to the nonce word ""bluf"" can be defined by the color that the previous word corresponds to. Specifically, whenever ""bluf"" is preceded by a word, the color output for ""bluf"" matches the color output of the previous word.

Here is the breakdown of how the rule applies in each example:

1. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" follows, resulting in ""blue."" However, since ""bluf"" is last and there was ""blue"" previously, it might be that it follows the color before it.
2. ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" then ""bluf"" follows, which also gives an output of ""red,"" matching the previous color.
3. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and when ""bluf"" follows, it produces ""green,"" which matches ""dax.""
4. ""zup"" gives ""yellow,"" followed by ""bluf"" which outputs ""yellow,"" matching the previous word's color.
5. ""dax"" gives ""green,"" and both occurrences of ""bluf"" after ""dax"" or ""zup"" (which correlates with ""yellow"") produce the respective previous word's color output.

Hence, the rule can be summarized as:

Rule: ""bluf"" outputs the color corresponding to the previous word.

Bluf -> meaning: The nonce word ""bluf"" takes on the color output of the word immediately preceding it in the sequence.",-5.2370411712700005,58,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it can be observed that the word ""bluf"" always results in the word ""green"" in the output, except for when it follows the word ""zup"", after which it results in ""yellow"". However, this is not consistent, as in the last example, ""zup bluf dax"" results in ""yellow yellow green"", and not ""yellow yellow yellow."" Thus, it seems that ""bluf"" generally translates to ""green,"" but the surrounding context, particularly the word immediately prior to ""bluf,"" may influence this under certain circumstances which are not fully determinable with the given examples.

Rule: ""bluf"" generally means ""green"", but the color can change based on context, specifically the word that precedes ""bluf"".",-7.45348178494,58,bluf

For instance, in the first example ""dax zup lug bluf"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""blue"". Similarly, in the second example ""wif bluf"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""red"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that comes before it and repeats it.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word immediately before it.",-8.6189108519,58,bluf
"bluf -> green. Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in each output.",-9.28054969516,58,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can analyze the patterns evident in each input-output pair:

1. When ""dax walm"" is an input, the output is ""green green green.""
2. The input ""zup walm"" results in the output ""yellow yellow yellow.""
3. ""wif walm dax"" produces the output ""red red red green.""
4. The input ""lug walm"" renders the output ""blue blue blue.""
5. Lastly, ""wif lug walm"" correlates with the output ""red blue blue blue.""

By examining the outputs associated with each input that contains ""walm,"" we see a repetition of a color word three times, except in the case where ""walm"" is followed by another word. This repetition suggests that ""walm"" signifies the repetition of the color word corresponding to the word preceding ""walm.""

Let's assess the case where ""walm"" is followed by a word:
- Input: ""wif walm dax"" results in ""red red red green,""
  which means ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""walm"" signifies repeating ""red"" three times, and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Thus, we can deduce that ""walm"" signifies repeating the color that corresponds to the word before ""walm"" three times, but when followed by another word, ""walm"" does not influence the color corresponding to the following word.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word before walm three times.",-2.62354874907,58,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look at the patterns in the given inputs and their corresponding outputs. Each input includes the word ""walm"" and some other words, and the output consists of a series of colors. We will first list the words and their corresponding color based on the given examples:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

Now let's examine the outputs in correlation with the presence of the word ""walm"" and the other words:

1. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   Analysis: The word ""dax"" appears twice and both times there are three greens. Before ""walm,"" the word ""lug"" appears and is followed by blue.

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Analysis: ""Zup"" correlates with yellow and ""walm"" extends the previous color thrice.

3. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   Analysis: ""Wif"" results in red and is followed by red twice. ""Dax"" at the end results in green.

4. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Analysis: ""Lug"" correlates with blue and ""walm"" follows with blue twice more.

5. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   Analysis: ""Wif"" results in red, ""lug"" in blue, and ""walm"" follows ""lug"" with two more blues.

From these examples, we can detect a pattern where ""walm"" seems to extend the color of the word immediately preceding it by adding that color two more times to the output.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word two additional times.

Let's confirm this rule with each example:

1. dax walm wif lug dax walm gives us green green (walm repeats) green red blue (walm repeats) blue green.
2. zup walm translates to yellow (walm repeats) yellow yellow.
3. wif walm dax becomes red (walm repeats) red red and then dax gives us green.
4. lug walm turns into blue (walm repeats) blue blue.
5. wif lug walm results in red blue (walm repeats) blue blue.

The deduction and the rule check out across all the examples provided.",-3.576010219404,58,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" takes the color associated with the previous word and triples it in the output.

Let's examine the examples to confirm this:

Example 1: ""dax walm wif lug dax walm""
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the output.
- Following ""dax walm,"" the color green is repeated three times.
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- Following the second occurrence of ""dax walm,"" the color green is repeated three times once again.

Example 2: ""zup walm""
- ""zup"" is a new word, and the output is three yellows. This suggests that ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- Following ""zup walm,"" the color yellow is repeated three times.

Example 3: ""wif walm dax""
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- Following ""wif walm,"" the color red is repeated three times.
- After ""walm"" has already been used, ""dax"" follows, corresponding to the color green.

Example 4: ""lug walm""
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- Following ""lug walm,"" the color blue is repeated three times.

Example 5: ""wif lug walm""
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, and ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- Following ""lug"" is ""walm,"" and thus the color blue is repeated three times.

Based on these observations, the rule is as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.",-5.041993417326,58,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns in each input and the respective outputs:

- Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
  Output: green green green red blue green green green

- Input: zup walm
  Output: yellow yellow yellow

- Input: wif walm dax
  Output: red red red green

- Input: lug walm
  Output: blue blue blue

- Input: wif lug walm
  Output: red blue blue blue

Looking at the patterns, ""walm"" always results in a repetition of a color based on the word immediately preceding it:

- ""dax"" corresponds to 'green', and following ""walm,"" we get ""green green green.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to 'yellow', and following ""walm,"" we get ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to 'red', and following ""walm,"" we get ""red red red.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to 'blue', and following ""walm,"" we get ""blue blue blue.""

Hence, ""walm"" seems to mean that the color associated with the preceding word should be repeated three times. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the associated color of the preceding word three times.",-7.0885524873120005,58,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns and see how ""walm"" affects the output in each example.

1. ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" -> Output: green green green red blue green green green

3. ""wif walm dax"" -> Output: red red red green
4. ""lug walm"" -> Output: blue blue blue
5. ""wif lug walm"" -> Output: red blue blue blue

Analyzing each individual case:

1. ""dax"" precedes and follows ""walm,"" and in both cases, it seems to be associated with the color green both before and after ""walm"" (green ... green green green). The colors red and blue appear after the words ""wif"" and ""lug,"" respectively.
2. In the case of ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" seems to be associated with the color yellow, which is repeated three times after ""walm.""
3. ""wif walm"" leads to three red outputs, and ""dax"" at the end of the sequence gives a single green output, which matches the pattern observed before.
4. ""lug walm"" leads to three blue outputs, which matches the previous pattern where ""lug"" led to the color blue.
5. ""wif lug walm"" gives a single red followed by three blue outputs, which again align with the previous associations of ""wif"" with red and ""lug"" with blue.

From these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" causes repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it three times.

However, when ""dax"" is presented alongside other nonce words like ""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""zup,"" and ""wif,"" each nonce word correlates with a color as an output.

Given this pattern, the rule is likely as follows:

Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" when it's the only word in the input. Each occurrence of ""zup"" at the beginning of the input precedes a sequence of ""yellow"" words in the output.

- Whenever ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""

Given this information, we can deduce that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word preceding it. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it repeats the color of the previous word in the output sequence.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning: ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word just before it in the sequence.",-5.376578055574998,59,bluf
"Observing the given examples, it is possible to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""bluf"".

In each example, the word ""bluf"" appears to correspond to the color ""red"". Additionally, it seems that other words also have a consistent color associated with them:

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green

Considering the consistency across the examples, the rule for ""bluf"" can be established as follows:

Rule: bluf -> red",-5.5213191533,59,bluf

""bluf"" consistently translates to the color red in every example, regardless of its position in the sequence or the context of the words around it.",-7.424786254111998,59,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the presence of the word ""walm"" results in a sequence of the word ""green"" being repeated until a new word is introduced. Here is the breakdown:

1. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red
- ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and before ""wif"" signals the word ""green"" to be repeated three times until ""wif"" changes the color to red.

2. dax wif walm lug zup -> green red red red blue yellow
- ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" and ""wif"" and is followed by ""lug"" without affecting the output of ""dax"" and ""wif"", but after ""walm"", ""lug"" generates three reds, indicating that the ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color that follows.

3. dax walm -> green green green
- ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and extends the color green associated with ""dax"" in repeated fashion.

4. lug walm wif lug -> blue blue blue red blue
- ""walm"" occurs after ""lug"" and results in ""lug's"" color, blue, being repeated.

5. wif dax lug walm -> red green blue blue blue
- ""walm"" at the end of the sequence causes the color corresponding to ""lug"" to repeat.

Rule: ""walm"" does not have its own color output but instead causes the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it to repeat until a new word is introduced.",-0.8979240304699999,59,walm
"To induce a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine its appearance and outputs in each example:

1. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red
2. dax wif walm lug zup -> green red red red blue yellow
3. dax walm -> green green green
4. lug walm wif lug -> blue blue blue red blue
5. wif dax lug walm -> red green blue blue blue

Looking at these examples, we can observe that every time ""walm"" appears in a sequence, the word that immediately follows ""walm"" is repeated in the output color sequence (its color is output multiple times in a row). That is, ""walm"" is followed by:

1. ""wif,"" and the color red appears twice.
2. ""lug,"" and the color red appears twice.
3. No word follows ""walm,"" and no color is repeated.
4. ""wif,"" and the color blue appears twice.
5. No word follows ""walm,"" and no color is repeated.

Based on this analysis, it appears that ""walm"" has the effect of repeating the color associated with the following word, except when ""walm"" is the last word, where there is no repetition. 

Rule: walm -> ""repeat the color of the following word"".",-1.010799158,59,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", let's analyze the instances where it appears and the corresponding outputs:

1. When ""walm"" comes after ""dax"":
   - Input: ""dax walm wif bluf"" -> Output: ""green green green red red""
   - Input: ""dax wif walm lug zup"" -> (ignoring ""walm"" part) -> Output before ""walm"": ""green red""
   - Input: ""dax walm"" -> Output: ""green green green""
   - Considering these examples, it seems that when ""walm"" follows ""dax"", it leads to a repetition of ""green"".

2. When ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence:
   - Input: ""dax walm"" -> Output: ""green green green""
   - It results in ""green"" being repeated.

3. When ""walm"" appears in other positions:
   - Input: ""lug walm wif lug"" -> Output: ""blue blue blue red blue""
   - Input: ""wif dax lug walm"" -> Output: ""red green blue blue blue""
   - In these positions, ""walm"" seems to result in ""blue"" being repeated.

From these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be related to repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it, with one exception identified in ""lug walm wif lug"" where it does not repeat ""red"" but continues with ""blue"". However, as there is an inconsistency with ""green"" and ""blue"" outputs, it is unclear if ""walm"" consistently causes a specific color to repeat. Additional examples would be needed to clarify the precise rule. Given the precedence of colors seen (""green"" appears more prominently), one might tentatively conclude the following, with caution:

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning. When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", it seems to induce a pattern of repeating ""green"". When ""walm"" appears in other positions, the pattern is less clear but may suggest a repetition of the color tied to the preceding word. Further examples are required for a precise rule.",-2.68233072148,59,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the outputs associated with each example to find a pattern that correlates with the presence of ""walm.""

First example:
Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red

In the output, we have three consecutive greens following ""dax walm."" The word ""dax"" corresponds to a single ""green,"" thus ""walm"" possibly represents ""green green.""

Second example:
Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow

In this case, ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""lug,"" and the corresponding output is ""red red red blue."" Considering the previous example where ""walm"" was associated with two additional greens, here it could once again be contributing to a repeated color, in this case ""red.""

Third example:
Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Here ""dax walm"" outputs three greens. This is consistent with ""dax"" meaning one green and ""walm"" meaning two greens.

Fourth example:
Input: lug walm wif lug
Output: blue blue blue red blue

Here, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" which is three blues. With ""lug"" normally corresponding to ""blue,"" ""walm"" should be adding two more blues.

Fifth example:
Input: wif dax lug walm
Output: red green blue blue blue

Similar to the previous patterns, after ""lug,"" we see two additional blues associated with ""walm.""

From these examples, we can ascertain a pattern. It looks like ""walm"" causes the previous color's output to repeat twice more. So if the last color is ""green,"" ""walm"" will cause ""green green"" to be added to the output. Accordingly, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> repeat the last color's output twice more.",-9.727251218584,59,walm
"walm -> repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

There are no examples where ""zup"" leads to any other color or any other variable output that would suggest a more complex rule. It is consistently mapped to a single output regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it. Therefore:

Rule: zup -> yellow",-9.9864695911,60,zup
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the instances in which the word appears and the corresponding outputs. Let's look for patterns:

1. ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue""
2. ""dax bluf wif lug"" -> ""green green red blue""
3. ""dax wif bluf"" -> ""green red red""
4. ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue""
5. ""dax lug wif bluf"" -> ""green blue red red""

By analyzing the patterns, it seems that ""bluf"" causes the following word to repeat the color given to the last word that appears before ""bluf"". Let's verify this pattern:

1. ""bluf lug"" -> ""blue blue"" - ""lug"" is blue both times after ""bluf.""
2. ""bluf wif"" -> ""red blue"" - ""wif"" is red following ""bluf.""
3. ""bluf"" alone caused ""wif"" to repeat red, which was the color assigned to it just before ""bluf.""
4. ""bluf lug"" -> ""yellow blue"" - ""lug"" is again blue after ""bluf,"" following the yellow ""zup.""
5. ""bluf"" caused ""wif"" to repeat red, the color assigned to it just before ""bluf.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it causes the subsequent word to take on the color of the word immediately preceding ""bluf"".

Rule: bluf -> causes the next color to repeat the color of the previous word.",-0.908972371008,60,bluf
"Analyzing each example where ""bluf"" appears alongside the output sequence, we can identify a pattern that helps determine the meaning of ""bluf."" Let's examine the appearances of ""bluf"" and the corresponding outputs:

1. wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
2. dax bluf wif lug -> green green red blue
3. dax wif bluf -> green red red
4. zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue
5. dax lug wif bluf -> green blue red red

Upon inspection, it becomes clear that every time ""bluf"" is mentioned, the corresponding output is ""red."" However, there is also a case where ""lug"" from example one is translated to ""blue,"" which departs from other sequences where ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" only once and ""green"" in all other instances. This oddity in example one might be the result of a typographical error (either ""walm"" was intended to be ""bluf"" or an extra ""blue"" in the output). We will disregard the aberrant part of example one, assuming a faithful pattern in the other instances.

Given this analysis, we can extract the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> red",-1.2907762388639998,60,bluf
"Analyzing the given examples, it appears that the output is a list of color names that correspond to each nonce word in the input. Looking specifically at the input/output pairs that contain the nonce word ""bluf,"" we can try to determine its meaning by comparing the common factor in the outputs.

Here are the instances of ""bluf"" from the given examples, along with their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: bluf | Output: blue
2. Input: bluf | Output: red
3. Input: bluf | Output: red
4. Input: bluf | Output: yellow
5. Input: bluf | Output: red

Right away, we can discard ""blue"" as the meaning of ""bluf,"" because it does not consistently map to ""blue"" in the output.

Next, we notice that ""bluf"" sometimes corresponds to ""red"" and other times to ""yellow."" Looking at the surrounding words, ""wif"" and ""lug,"" we see that they correspond to ""red"" and ""blue,"" respectively, in the output. There might be a pattern in which the appearance of ""bluf"" in the input causes the output to repeat the color that comes right before ""bluf.""

Let’s verify this hypothesis with the instances:

1. Input: lug bluf (preceding word: lug) | Output: blue red (red is not the color corresponding to the preceding word ""lug,"" which is ""green"")
2. Input: wif bluf (preceding word: wif) | Output: red red (red is the color corresponding to the preceding word ""wif"")
3. Input: wif bluf (preceding word: wif) | Output: red red (red is the color corresponding to the preceding word ""wif"")
4. Input: zup bluf (preceding word: zup) | Output: yellow yellow (yellow is the color corresponding to the preceding word ""zup"")
5. Input: wif bluf (preceding word: wif) | Output: red red (red is the color corresponding to the preceding word ""wif"")

It seems that the rule doesn't hold in the first example, where ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" but ""blue"" does not repeat as ""red"" does in the other examples.

Given this inconsistency, it's difficult to assert a definitive rule for ""bluf"" based on the provided data. The data is contradictory, as ""bluf"" does not always repeat the color of the preceding word, nor does it correspond to a color invariantly. To provide a conclusive rule, a consistent pattern or additional examples are required. 

Based on the current examples, a potential rule could be that ""bluf"" replicates the color of the preceding word most of the time. However, without more information or consistent examples, this rule cannot be definitively stated. 

Rule: No consistent rule can be definitively stated for the meaning of ""bluf"" based on the given data. More consistent examples would be required to induce a rule.",-5.3563283755706665,60,bluf
"Analyzing the given examples, let's align the inputs and outputs to visualize any patterns:

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug

3. Input: dax wif bluf

4. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
   
5. Input: dax lug wif bluf
   Output: green blue red red

From these examples, we can see that the output immediately after the word 'bluf' is always 'red', regardless of the preceding word. Additionally, 'bluf' never corresponds to a color itself in the output, whereas all other words (wif, lug, dax, zup) get a color assignment (red, blue, green, yellow respectively). Therefore, 'bluf' likely indicates a repetition of the color that follows it in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> the subsequent color is repeated.",-7.583875460630002,60,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. It can be observed that regardless of position or surrounding words, the output for ""bluf"" remains the same. Here is the rule deduced from the examples:

3. lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue
4. dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue blue yellow red
5. zup dax walm lug wif -> yellow green green green blue red

Looking at the inputs and outputs, ""walm"" is associated with a repetition of the color that comes right before it. For example:

- In 1st input, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which outputs ""green"", so ""walm"" manifests as ""green"" repeated until the next word.
- In 2nd input, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which outputs ""yellow"", so ""walm"" leads to ""yellow"" repeated.
- In 3rd input, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" as well, resulting in ""yellow"" repeated.
- In 4th input, ""walm"" follows ""lug"", leads to the color ""blue"" being repeated.
- In 5th input, ""walm"" follows ""dax"", resulting in the color ""green"" repeated.

Each occurrence of ""walm"" is immediately followed by the repetition of the previously mentioned color until a new color word is introduced.

Rule: walm -> Causes the repetition of the previously mentioned color's output until the next color word.",-1.0633184752920002,60,walm

Let's analyze the examples:

1. lug dax walm wif
   Output: blue green green green red
  - Here, ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" after ""dax"" and before ""wif.""

2. wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
  - Here, ""walm"" corresponds with a sequence of ""yellow.""

3. lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
  - ""Walm"" results in ""yellow"" following ""zup"" and before ""lug.""

4. dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
  - ""Walm"" results in ""blue"" following ""lug"" and preceding ""zup.""

5. zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red
  - ""Walm"" aligns with repeated ""green"" following ""dax"" and preceding ""lug.""

Considering these observations, we can identify a pattern where ""walm"" seems to result in a color that matches the color of the word preceding it, except when ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" in which case it results in ""red"" regardless of the previous color:

- After ""lug"" (blue), ""walm"" outputs ""blue.""
- After ""dax"" (green), ""walm"" outputs ""green.""
- After ""zup"" (yellow), ""walm"" leads to ""yellow.""

However, when followed by ""wif,"" ""walm"" changes the sequence to end with red. Following this logic, let's propose the rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning is ""repeat the color of the previous word."" If ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" the output is red. 

This explanation seems to fit the provided examples.",-5.911205943510001,60,walm

   - 'walm' is followed by two occurrences of green, despite different words preceding and following it.

2. Input: wif dax zup walm

5. Input: zup dax walm lug wif

From these examples, we can observe:

- In every instance where ""walm"" occurs, the color that follows is the same as the color that precedes it (""walm wif"" being the exception, where the color changes to red regardless, suggesting a different rule for ""wif"").
- ""wif"", when placed after ""walm"", changes the sequence by turning green to red.

With this information, we can infer the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it unless followed by ""wif"", in which case it changes the color to red.

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" is:

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we will observe its corresponding output in each example. 

1. Input: ""wif lug zup bluf"" -> Output: ""red blue yellow yellow""
2. Input: ""wif bluf lug zup"" -> Output: ""red red blue yellow""
3. Input: ""zup dax bluf zup dax"" -> Output: ""yellow green green yellow green""
4. Input: ""wif bluf lug zup"" -> Output: ""red red blue yellow""
5. Input: ""zup bluf lug zup"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow blue yellow""

Through these examples, we can observe the following:

- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red.""
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""

Looking specifically at ""bluf:""

- In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" while the word preceding it ""zup"" also corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" and is preceded by ""wif,"" which also corresponds to ""red.""
- The third example contains ""bluf"" corresponding to ""green"" and is preceded by ""dax,"" which also corresponds to ""green.""
- In the fourth example, like the second, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" and is preceded by ""wif.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" preceded by ""zup.""

From these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word that immediately precedes it. It is a placeholder for repetition of the previous color mentioned.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word before it.",-0.614713830739,61,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following rule for the nonce word ""bluf"":

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color represented by the word that immediately precedes it.

Supporting Evidence:

- In the first input, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which translates to blue, and the corresponding output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow."" However, looking at the other examples, it seems like ""bluf"" following ""lug"" resulted in ""blue"" instead of ""yellow."" Hence, the first example appears to contain an inconsistency based on the provided outputs from the other examples.
- In the second input, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the corresponding output for ""bluf"" is ""red.""
- In the third input, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the corresponding output for ""bluf"" is ""green.""
- In the fourth input, similar to the second, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the corresponding output for ""bluf"" is ""red.""
- In the fifth input, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" for the first occurrence and the corresponding output is ""yellow."" For the second occurrence of ""bluf,"" it still follows ""zup"" and the output remains ""yellow.""

Therefore, with an assumption that there may be a mistake in the output of the first example, the rule can be stated as follows:

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to be directly influencing the color output immediately after its occurrence. Each instance of ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the same color, three times, which corresponds to the previous color word:

1. lug walm zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow red
   - ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times.

2. lug walm -> blue blue blue
   - Again, ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times.

3. dax walm -> green green green
   - ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times.

4. wif walm zup lug zup walm -> red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times.
   - The second occurrence of ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which led to ""yellow,"" and so ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times.

5. lug dax zup dax walm wif -> blue green yellow green green green red
   - ""dax"" before ""walm"" leads to ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times.

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word directly before ""walm"" three times.",-0.9576709640859999,61,walm
"Based on the examples given, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the output word to repeat based on the color associated with the word preceding ""walm"". Here are the observed patterns:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"", indicating that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" causes the word ""blue"" to be repeated three times.
- ""dax walm"" produces ""green green green"", suggesting that ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""walm"" again causes the color to be repeated three times.
- In the case of ""wif walm,"" since ""wif"" produces ""red,"" ""walm"" leads to ""red red red"".

The number of repetitions doesn't seem to be constant but likely depends on how many colors are there in the sequence before ""walm"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
Rule: ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it to be repeated in the output. The number of repetitions corresponds to the total number of unique color words that have appeared in sequence before ""walm"".

If the preceding word is ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" repeated three times. If ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" then the output would be ""red"" repeated three times.

walm -> Repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.",-7.65406534546,61,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to observe the patterns and associations in the given examples.

1. Input: lug walm zup wif | Output: blue blue blue yellow red
2. Input: lug walm | Output: blue blue blue
3. Input: dax walm | Output: green green green
4. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm | Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
5. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif | Output: blue green yellow green green green red

Observations:

- Whenever ""lug walm"" is mentioned together, the output is ""blue blue blue"" regardless of the other words (see examples 1 and 2).
- When ""dax walm"" is mentioned, the output is ""green green green"" (see example 3).
- In example 4, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"" and ""lug zup walm"" results in ""blue yellow yellow yellow.""
- In example 5, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"" consistent with example 3, and the word ""wif"" at the end changes the sequence's last color to red.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" causes the word before it to repeat its corresponding color three times. The word before ""walm"" determines the color:

- ""lug"" before ""walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue.""
- ""dax"" before ""walm"" leads to ""green green green.""
- ""wif"" before ""walm"" leads to ""red red red.""

The word ""zup"" when following ""lug walm"" or any other sequence does not seem to follow the pattern of repeating a color three times. Instead, it adds ""yellow"" each time it appears but does not affect the ""walm"" pattern.

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the color of the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times.

Example:
- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""

- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" (Example 3), the output is ""green green green,"" indicating that ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""walm"" causes a triple repeat of ""green.""

In Examples 4 and 5, ""walm"" follows words that don't immediately precede it, yet we still observe a pattern of repetition based on the color corresponding to the preceding word.

- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" with no other words following, the output is ""green green,"" showing that ""bluf"" doesn't depend on the presence of another word after it to maintain the output of a double color.

3. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm => Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
4. Input: dax bluf wif lug zup => Output: green green red blue yellow
5. Input: dax bluf => Output: green green

The word ""bluf"" always results in the previous color being repeated once more. It's worth noting that ""bluf"" never introduces a new color; it only repeats the color generated by the word before it. 

For instance:
- In the first example, ""wif"" outputs ""red,"" and ""bluf"" then repeats ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" outputs ""red,"" and ""bluf"" repeats ""red"" even though ""zup"" introduced ""yellow"" before ""wif.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" results in ""green,"" and ""bluf"" repeats ""green.""

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color that the previous word translates to.",-6.853969493433999,62,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's identify patterns in the given examples:

3. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm | Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
4. Input: dax bluf wif lug zup | Output: green green red blue yellow
5. Input: dax bluf | Output: green green

Analyzing these, we notice:
- Whenever ""bluf"" appears, the next color in the output is repeated once (example 1, 2, 5).
- The color before ""bluf"" does not repeat unless ""bluf"" is preceded by another instance of the preceding word (example 1, 5).
- ""Bluf"" appears to cause a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it. If ""bluf"" is the second word in the input, it repeats the color corresponding to the first word. If ""bluf"" follows two identical words, it still causes the color for that word to repeat.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" can be formulated as follows:

Bluf -> causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated in the output.

Rule: If X is the word before ""bluf"" in the input, and the color associated with X is Y, then the output will repeat the color Y following its first occurrence.",-7.579524818725003,62,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" influences the color pattern output, with each occurrence of ""walm"" resulting in three repetitions of the same color. Analyzing each input and corresponding output:

1. Input: ""zup walm wif""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow red""
   - ""zup"" might correspond to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" might correspond to ""red."" ""walm"" operates to produce three ""yellow"" before ""red,"" indicating ""walm"" could be related to triplicating the color associated with the word before it.

2. Input: ""wif walm dax""
   Output: ""red red red green""
   - In this instance, ""wif"" could correspond to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" Again, ""walm"" precedes three instances of ""red,"" reinforcing the idea that it could cause a triplication effect.

3. Input: ""dax wif walm""
   Output: ""green red red red""
   - With ""dax"" first, the color ""green"" is output, followed by ""wif,"" which aligns with ""red."" The ""walm"" after ""wif"" once again results in the triplication of ""red.""

4. Input: ""dax walm zup lug""
   Output: ""green green green yellow blue""
   - In this sequence, ""dax"" corresponds to a single ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" there are three ""green."" ""zup"" follows and switches to ""yellow,"" and ""lug,"" which has not been previously defined, corresponds to ""blue.""

5. Input: ""dax walm""
   Output: ""green green green""
   - Finally, with no word following ""walm,"" it still induces a triplication of the color associated with ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

Considering the consistent repetition of the color associated with the word preceding ""walm,"" the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm causes the color corresponding to the word before it to be repeated three times in the output.

Thus, the meaning of ""walm"" could be abstracted as:

walm -> Triplicates the color associated with the preceding word.",-0.5752485328429999,62,walm
"Observing the examples given, the output pattern changes whenever the word 'walm' is introduced. It seems to cause the following word's corresponding color to repeat thrice before moving on to the next word (if there is one). Each word other than 'walm' appears to have a fixed associated color:

- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue

Now, applying this pattern to the sets of inputs provided:

In the first example, ""zup walm wif,"" 'zup' corresponds to yellow, then 'walm' causes the next word's color to repeat. Since 'wif' corresponds to red, the sequence is yellow (zup), followed by three reds (walm wif).

In the second example, ""wif walm dax,"" 'wif' corresponds to red, then 'walm' makes the color of 'dax' (green) repeat three times.

In the third example, ""dax wif walm,"" 'dax' corresponds to green, 'wif' to red, and then 'walm' makes the last mentioned color (red) repeat three times.

In the fourth example, ""dax walm zup lug,"" 'dax' is green. 'Walm' makes the green repeat twice more, followed by 'zup,' which is yellow, and 'lug,' which corresponds to blue.

In the final example, ""dax walm,"" 'dax' is green, and 'walm' makes the green repeat twice more due to the absence of a subsequent word. 

So, the rule seems to be that 'walm' makes the subsequent word's corresponding color repeat three times in the output. When 'walm' is the last word or when there is no word after walm, the last mentioned color is the one that repeats.

Rule: walm -> Causes the next word's associated color to repeat three times. If 'walm' is the last word, causes the last mentioned color to repeat.",-3.0995267833999995,62,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word 'walm' seems to be associated with a repeating of the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it. The pattern indicates that the color is repeated three times. We can extrapolate the meaning of 'walm' by examining each input and its corresponding output.

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red
Here, 'zup' corresponds to yellow, and 'walm' causes the 'yellow' to be repeated three times before another color comes into play ('wif' -> red).

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
'Wif' corresponds to red, and 'walm' leads to 'red' being repeated three times, followed by a different color ('dax' -> green).

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red
'Dax' corresponds to green and 'wif' to red. Since 'walm' follows 'wif,' it results in 'red' being repeated three times.

Input: dax walm zup lug
Output: green green green yellow blue
'Dax' corresponds to green, and 'walm' produces three 'greens' following it. 'Zup' then corresponds to yellow, and 'lug' leads to an additional color, blue.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
Again, 'dax' corresponds to green and 'walm' leads to it being output three times.

Therefore, the rule for 'walm' appears to be:

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red
- ""dax"" correlates with the first ""green"" in the output.

Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
Output: green green red yellow red
- ""dax"" is again correlated with the first ""green"" in the output.

Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
- Here, ""dax"" appears later in the input sequence, and it correlates with the first ""green"" occurring after some other colors.

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
- Once again, the presence of ""dax"" correlates with the first ""green"" in the output, with subsequent colors differing.

Input: dax
Output: green
- The single term ""dax"" correlates with a single ""green"" output.

The rule we can derive is that ""dax"" directly corresponds to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position within the input sequence. It does not depend on the context or the presence of other words.

Rule: dax -> green",-7.40038207118,63,dax
"To identify the rule for ""dax,"" let's look at the common pattern across all the examples. Each input example contains the word ""dax,"" and each associated output has the color ""green"" in a specific position. 

In the first input ""dax walm wif bluf,"" the output is ""green green green red red."" If we map each word to its respective color, ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green.""

In the second input, ""dax bluf wif zup wif,"" we again find that ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green"" in the output ""green green red yellow red.""

This pattern holds consistently across all examples provided, where ""dax"" is in the input, the color ""green"" immediately follows in the output, regardless of the position of ""dax.""

Based on this information, we can deduce that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green",-7.5092169128199995,63,dax
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we can analyze the patterns in the provided input and output examples. We will focus on the presence of ""dax"" in each input and its corresponding position(s) in the output sequences.

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red

Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
Output: green green red yellow red

Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

Input: dax
Output: green

From the examples provided, we can see that:
- Every time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" leads the output sequence, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input.
- If ""dax"" is the only word in the input, the output is solely ""green.""

Based on these observations, it is possible to deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green,"" and whenever it appears in the input, it triggers an output of ""green"" at the corresponding position in the output sequence. If ""dax"" is the only input, the color ""green"" is the sole output.",-8.116968491056001,63,dax
"Based on the given examples, each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""green."" Other words in the input seem to produce different colors in the output, but ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green."" As such, we can deduce the following rule:

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the output will be ""green.""",-11.149542680999998,63,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can infer that the word ""dax"" has a corresponding color, which is green. Each example includes the word ""dax"" and regardless of its position in the input, it results in the color green in the output. No other context is given that might affect the meaning of ""dax,"" suggesting that it consistently translates to the color green.

Rule: dax -> green",-12.01905892844,63,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can make an observation about the color that corresponds to each word.

1. Every time ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red.""
2. The color following ""wif"" seems to repeat the color that ""wif"" translates to until a different word is introduced.
3. When a new word is introduced, it changes the output color and again repeats that color output until another new word is introduced.

So, taking the first example:
- ""wif"" outputs ""red.""
- ""zup"" follows ""wif"" and changes the output to ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" doesn't appear in the output, which suggests that it might not influence the color change but could be a filler or null word that isn't assigned a direct output color. However, since it's followed by ""lug,"" which outputs ""blue"" and is repeated, ""bluf"" might serve to maintain the current color, ""yellow,"" for one more instance before ""lug"" changes it.
- ""lug"" outputs ""blue.""
- ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and doesn't change the color output, indicating that ""walm"" might also mean ""red.""
- ""dax"" follows ""walm"" and changes the output to ""green.""

If we apply this reasoning to the other examples:

2. ""wif walm zup"" produces ""red red red yellow.""
3. ""zup wif walm lug"" produces ""yellow red red red blue.""
4. ""wif"" alone produces ""red.""
5. ""dax walm wif"" produces ""green green green red.""

This consistent pattern points to a rule: the word ""wif"" always results in the color ""red"" and causes the following words to repeat the output of ""red"" until a new word that corresponds to a different color is introduced. The word following ""wif"" does not change the color unless it is inherently associated with a different color (like ""dax"" or ""zup"").

Other words like ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""walm,"" and ""dax"" correspond to other colors, but ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red.""

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red",-10.914040681648,63,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we see that each word seems to correspond to a specific color: ""zup"" to yellow, ""wif"" to red, ""lug"" to blue, and ""walm"" to blue as well. It's also noteworthy that the number of repetitions for the corresponding color seems to match the position of the word within the sequence. For example, ""lug walm zup walm"" translates to one blue, one blue, and then two yellows, as ""zup"" is the third word in the sequence.

Here's a breakdown of how that works with the given examples:
- ""zup"" on its own produces ""yellow"".
- ""zup wif"" produces ""yellow red"" as ""wif"" is the second word.
- ""lug walm zup walm"" has ""lug"" and ""walm"" before ""zup,"" so when ""zup"" appears as the third word, it produces two yellows.
- ""wif walm zup"" has ""wif"" and ""walm"" before ""zup,"" making ""zup"" again translate to two yellows because it's the third word.
- ""zup wif walm lug"" starts with ""zup,"" resulting in one yellow, followed by ""wif"" which is the second word producing two reds, ""walm"" as the third word producing three reds, and ""lug"" as the fourth word producing four blues.

Using these observations, the rule seems to be that each instance of the word ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow"" and the number of times ""yellow"" is mentioned is based on the placement of ""zup"" in the sequence - the first position yields one yellow, the second yields two yellows, and so on.

Rule: zup -> yellow, with the number of repetitions equal to the position of ""zup"" in the sequence.",-4.6497215628660005,63,zup
"Analyzing the examples provided, each ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" Additionally, it might be noted that for the translations of the other words, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red,"" ""walm"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" as well. 

Moreover, the number of colors in the output corresponds to the number of words in the input. However, with the word ""zup,"" it translates to the color yellow repeatedly for the number of subsequent ""walm"" after it. This suggests that ""zup"" not only translates to yellow but also indicates repetition of the yellow color for every ""walm"" word that follows it until a different word appears.

Based on this, the rule appears to be:
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
- If ""walm"" follows ""zup"", repeat ""yellow"" for each ""walm""

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" makes the output repeat the color associated with the word that directly precedes it. Here is the breakdown:

- ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red"", which suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red and ""bluf"" is causing it to repeat.
- ""lug bluf wif"" outputs ""blue blue red"", indicating ""lug"" corresponds to blue, which is then repeated because of ""bluf"", and ""wif"" corresponds to red, not affected by ""bluf"" because it follows it.
- ""zup bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow"", meaning ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""bluf"" repeats it.
- The repetition of ""zup bluf"" provides the same output ""yellow yellow"", further supporting the rule.
- ""dax bluf wif lug zup"" outputs ""green green red blue yellow"". Here, ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"", thus ""dax"" corresponds to green and is repeated; ""wif"" follows and is not repeated, giving red; ""lug"" gives blue and ""zup"" yellow without repetition as they are not preceded by ""bluf"".

- ""dax"" translates to ""green""

Rule: The word ""bluf"" causes the Output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. For instance, ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, and ""bluf"" indicates that this color should be repeated. Similarly, ""lug bluf wif"" results in ""blue blue red"" because ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""bluf"" signals the repetition of this color. Hence, the color associated with ""lug"" is mentioned twice, followed by the color associated with ""wif."" This pattern holds for all provided examples.",-2.63711276914,63,bluf

Input: zup bluf          --> Output: yellow yellow
Input: dax bluf wif lug zup --> Output: green green red blue yellow

Based on the data, bluf appears to double the color word that follows or precedes it. Taking this into consideration:
- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"" indicating that bluf is causing the color ""red"" to be repeated.
- ""lug bluf wif"" results in ""blue blue red,"" where bluf is causing the color ""blue"" to be repeated.
- ""zup bluf"" has the output ""yellow yellow,"" where bluf causes ""yellow"" to be repeated.
- The doubling is maintained in the same order when there are multiple colors after ""bluf"" as seen in ""dax bluf wif lug zup"" resulting in ""green green red blue yellow"".

From the given examples, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> causes the immediately following color word to be repeated.

However, the rule needs to account for a scenario where there is a color word before ""bluf,"" since ""lug bluf wif"" repeats the ""blue"" which comes before ""bluf"".

Final Rule: bluf -> causes the closest adjacent color word to be repeated. If the color word is after bluf, it repeats that color; if the color word is before bluf, it repeats the preceding color.",-5.114693336937998,63,bluf

Input: lug bluf wif
Output: blue blue red

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
Output: green green red blue yellow

By examining the input-output pairs, we can infer the following patterns:

1. The word ""bluf"" corresponds directly to a color that is repeated twice in the output.
2. The word preceding ""bluf"" determines the color we see in the output.
3. The color does not seem to depend on the position of the word ""bluf"" in the sequence, as it repeats the color that corresponds to the word immediately before ""bluf.""

So, based on the information provided:

- ""wif"" corresponds with ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds with ""green""

- In the first example ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug,"" we see that ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" isn't used in the outputs, ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""dax"" with ""green."" The word ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" (blue), and after ""walm,"" the output repeats the color of the most recent word until a new color is introduced, so ""walm"" here seems to cause repetition of the preceding color.
  
- In the second example ""dax walm,"" we have ""green green green,"" which means ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to ""dax"" (green) as no other colors are presented.

- In the third example ""zup lug walm,"" the output ""yellow blue blue blue"" suggests that after ""lug"" (blue), ""walm"" again causes a repetition of the color blue.

- In the fourth example ""zup wif walm lug,"" the output ""yellow red red red blue"" indicates that after ""wif"" (red), ""walm"" causes the repetition of red until a new word with an assigned color (""lug,"" which is blue) is presented.

- In the fifth example ""dax walm lug,"" the output ""green green green blue"" shows the same pattern of ""walm"" inducing the repetition of ""dax"" (green) until ""lug"" (blue) appears.

Based on the examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the most recent color in the sequence until a new color word is introduced.

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the last mentioned color until a new color word is introduced.",-3.0551701616800004,63,walm
"The nonce word ""walm"" appears to correspond to the color ""blue"" in each of the given outputs. However, there is an additional pattern that can be observed. The presence of ""walm"" seems to result in the repetition of the color blue for the number of words that precede it in the input sequence until a new color word interrupts the sequence. Let us examine this pattern in the given examples:

- In the first input, after ""walm"" we have ""dax lug."" ""dax"" is a new color, specifically green, so ""walm"" repeated blue twice to match ""bluf lug"" before it, until ""dax"" changed the color to green.
- In the second input, there are no words after ""walm,"" and ""dax"" is before it, which corresponds to green. Since ""walm"" comes immediately after ""dax,"" the output is all green.
- In the third input, ""walm"" repeats the blue of ""lug"" because there is no subsequent color word to change the pattern.
- In the fourth input, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, and repeats the red for as many words that follow, until ""lug"" which is blue.
- In the fifth input, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, and repeats the green for as many words as follow until ""lug,"" which is blue.

Therefore, we can derive a rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" -> Causes the preceding color word's color to repeat for each word that follows until a new color word appears. If ""walm"" immediately follows another color word, the output color is that word's corresponding color repeated for as many subsequent words as there are until another color word appears. If ""walm"" is the first word, the default color blue is used.",-7.52293895052,63,walm
"From analyzing the given input-output pairs, we can infer that each word has a corresponding color. Now, let's map the words to the colors:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

When examining the examples related to the nonce word ""walm"", we see that ""walm"" always results in a chain of the same color in the output. To establish what color ""walm"" corresponds to, we can look at the cases where it's used with known color words.

In the first example, when used after ""lug"" (blue), it results in subsequent ""blue"" outputs. However, when ""walm"" is used after ""dax"" (green), all the subsequent outputs are ""green"", as seen in the second and fifth examples. In the examples with ""zup"" (yellow) and ""wif"" (red), ""walm"" follows the existing color pattern of ""yellow"" and ""red"" respectively with subsequent repetitions of that color.

Hence, we can deduce that ""walm"" doesn't have a color of its own but instead repeats the preceding color output in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the previously mentioned word's corresponding output.",-8.07064768529,63,walm
"To figure out what ""walm"" means, we need to look at the correlation between its usage and the output colors.

For instance:

- In ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug,"" the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue,"" and after ""walm"" we see ""blue"" repeated until ""dax,"" which changes the color to ""green.""
- In ""dax walm,"" given that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" the output is only ""green"" repeated three times, suggesting that ""walm"" continues the color of ""dax"" throughout.
- Similarly, in ""zup lug walm,"" the color ""blue"" corresponding to ""lug"" is repeated after ""walm.""
- In ""zup wif walm lug,"" ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red,"" so there's a repetition of ""red"" until ""lug"" switches the color to ""blue.""

"To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""dax,"" let's analyze the outputs for each input where ""dax"" is present and look for a pattern.

- In the first input ""dax walm,"" the presence of ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- In the second input ""zup dax bluf,"" the word ""dax"" is still associated with ""green.""

- The word ""zup"" precedes other words that have a color associated with them, but ""zup"" itself is consistently translated to ""yellow"" regardless of what follows.

Examples:

1. ""zup bluf wif walm"" produced ""yellow yellow red red red"". Here, the word following ""bluf"" was ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color red, and ""bluf"" resulted in an additional red being produced.

2. ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" resulted in ""green green red yellow blue"". Here, ""wif"" comes after ""bluf"" and is red, so ""bluf"" results in an additional red.

3. ""wif bluf"" led to ""red red"". Following this pattern, ""bluf"" duplicates the red that comes from ""wif.""

4. ""lug dax bluf wif dax"" gave us ""blue green green red green"". Again, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" so it generates an extra red.

5. ""lug wif lug bluf"" resulted in ""blue red blue blue"". The word ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to blue, so it results in an additional blue.

bluf -> meaning. The word ""bluf"" causes the color of the word that immediately follows it to be duplicated in the output sequence.",-0.81786550904,64,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the color outputs for each input example:

1. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
2. dax bluf wif zup lug -> green green red yellow blue
3. wif bluf -> red red
4. lug dax bluf wif dax -> blue green green red green
5. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue

Analyzing the patterns:

- When ""bluf"" appears after ""zup,"" the colors following it are ""yellow red red red."" Since ""zup"" alone results in ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" did not appear elsewhere, this information is inconclusive.
- When ""bluf"" appears after ""dax,"" the color following it is ""red."" Since ""dax"" alone results in ""green,"" the presence of ""bluf"" does not change the output for ""dax,"" but for the word following ""bluf,"" it results in ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" stands alone with ""wif,"" it results in ""red red.""
- When ""bluf"" appears after ""lug dax,"" the color following is ""red,"" and ""dax"" has the usual output of ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" appears after ""lug wif lug,"" it results in ""blue.""

One commonality is that the word following ""bluf"" always results in the color ""red,"" except when ""bluf"" is the last word. This indicates that ""bluf"" likely changes the output color of the word that follows it to ""red"" in each instance where a word does follow ""bluf."" Where ""bluf"" is the last word, the rule seems inapplicable, and thus ""bluf"" has no discernible direct effect.

Therefore, ""bluf"" changes the output color of the word following it to ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> when followed by another word, changes that word's output color to ""red."" If it is the last word, it seems to have no effect.",-1.1567922299020001,64,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, bluf seems to correspond directly to the repetition of the colors associated with the preceding word. Here's the rule deduced from the examples:

- In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" ""Bluf"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, so it leads to ""yellow"" followed by three ""red.""

- In the second example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" is again ""red,"" while ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" Following ""bluf,"" ""red"" is repeated once.

- In the third example, there is only ""wif"" before ""bluf,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" After ""bluf,"" ""red"" is repeated once.

- In the fourth example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" After ""bluf,"" ""red"" is again repeated once.

- In the fifth example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" After ""lug"" and before ""bluf,"" there is another ""lug"" (blue), and hence after ""bluf,"" ""blue"" is repeated twice.

The rule that can be induced from these examples is:

Rule: bluf -> Causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated once in the output.

In each example, whatever color corresponds to the word immediately before ""bluf,"" that color is repeated once immediately after the ""bluf"" term in the output. If the term before ""bluf"" repeats (as in the last example with ""lug""), the color repeats for as many times as the term appears before ""bluf.""",-3.84459701786,64,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can look at the correspondence of the output to its placement in the input sentence relative to ""bluf."" The output reveals a color for each word in the input sequence. By comparing the output colors to the input words, we can establish a pattern for each word and then identify the rule that ""bluf"" must follow:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Given these associations, we notice that the color directly following ""bluf"" in the output sequence is always ""red,"" which is the color associated with ""wif."" It appears that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word immediately following it. Every instance of ""bluf"" is followed by the color corresponding to the next word in the sequence. Therefore:

bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color associated with the word immediately following it.

Rule: If ""bluf"" is followed by a word, the color corresponding to that word is repeated in the output sequence.",-5.628737657019999,64,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's focus on the consistent patterns that follow its use in the provided examples:

1. After ""bluf,"" the word ""wif"" always translates to ""red.""
2. No other words appear repeatedly after ""bluf"" across the different examples, making ""wif"" the key to understanding ""bluf.""
3. In the first example, ""walm"" following ""wif"" results in three ""red"" outputs, suggesting a multiplication or repetition rule related to ""wif.""
4. Words preceding ""bluf"" do not have a consistent translation or a pattern that might influence the output of ""wif."" 

Given these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" triggers duplication or repetition of the color associated with the word that follows ""bluf."" For example, ""wif"" always results in ""red red,"" which is a doubling of ""red."" In the first example, ""walm"" possibly does not have a color associated with it and instead signifies that the preceding color should be repeated multiple times (three times here).

Rule: bluf -> causes duplication or repetition of the color translation of the word that immediately follows it. If the following word does not have a color translation, it might be a signal for how many times the preceding color should be repeated.",-8.04202526006,64,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let us examine the given examples and their corresponding outputs closely:

1. Input: ""zup walm lug zup wif dax""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green""
   
2. Input: ""zup walm dax lug""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow green blue""
   
3. Input: ""lug wif walm""
   Output: ""blue red red red""
   
4. Input: ""zup walm lug""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow blue""
   
5. Input: ""dax zup walm wif walm""
   Output: ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red""

Let's analyze the inputs and outputs to figure out the pattern.

In every example, the word ""walm"" seems to always result in additional repetitions of the color corresponding to the word that follows ""walm."" The word before ""walm"" does not appear to have an impact on this repetition.

Using that logic, let's break down the examples:

1. After ""walm,"" the word ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and we see an extra yellow before the blue, suggesting that ""walm"" results in repeating the color before the target word (lug -> blue).
   
2. The same happens with ""dax"" following ""walm,"" resulting in an additional yellow before the output color green that corresponds to ""dax.""
   
3. When ""walm"" is last and only followed by ""lug,"" repeating the color red that corresponds to ""wif"" found before ""walm."" So ""walm"" still results in additional repetitions of the color preceding its occurrence.
   
4. Only ""zup"" and ""lug"" color outputs are involved (yellow and blue), indicating the same pattern of repetition due to ""walm.""
   
5. The word ""walm"" is present twice. In both cases, the word that follows is ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color red, and ""walm"" results in additional reds being added to the output.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color corresponding to the word following it, making that color appear an extra time in the pattern.

Rule: walm -> causes repetition of the color corresponding to the word that follows ""walm"".",-0.4766793207719999,64,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the following color word to repeat its output the number of times that ""walm"" has been consecutively said plus one. Let's analyze the examples to confirm:

1. ""zup walm lug zup wif dax""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - The first occurrence of ""walm"" makes ""lug"" (""blue"") repeat once, so it's output just once.
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" again
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

2. ""zup walm dax lug""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - The first occurrence of ""walm"" makes ""dax"" (""green"") repeat once, so it's output just once.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

3. ""lug wif walm""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - The first occurrence of ""walm"" makes ""wif"" (""red"") repeat once, so it's output just once.

4. ""zup walm lug""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - The first occurrence of ""walm"" makes ""lug"" (""blue"") repeat once, so it's output just once.

5. ""dax zup walm wif walm""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - The first occurrence of ""walm"" makes ""wif"" (""red"") repeat once.
   - The second consecutive occurrence of ""walm"" makes ""wif"" (""red"") repeat twice.

In conclusion, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

walm -> Repeat the following color word a number of times equal to the consecutive occurrences of ""walm"" plus one.

So, in a way, ""walm"" acts as a multiplier for the repetition of the subsequent color word.",-5.244859903460001,64,walm
"walm -> meaning: yellow repeated the number of previous unique words

Rule: The word ""walm"" appears to represent a repeating of the color ""yellow"" a number of times equal to the number of unique words that have appeared previously in the sequence.

Let's check the rule against the provided examples:

- In the first example:
  Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
  Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
  The unique words before the first occurrence of ""walm"" are ""zup"". That's 1 unique word, so ""walm"" is replaced by ""yellow"" 1 time.

- Second example:
  Input: zup walm dax lug
  Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
  Here, ""walm"" follows one unique word ""zup"", so it leads to two ""yellow"" because ""zup"" itself counts as one and the ""walm"" adds another. After ""walm,"" the words ""dax"" and ""lug"" introduce new colors.

- Third example:
  Input: lug wif walm
  Output: blue red red red
  ""Walm"" is after two unique words ""lug"" and ""wif"", so ""walm"" results in three ""red"" colors.

- Fourth example:
  Input: zup walm lug
  Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
  ""Walm"" comes after ""zup"", resulting in two ""yellow"" followed by ""lug"" which is a new word, thus a new color ""blue"".

- Fifth example:
  Input: dax zup walm wif walm
  Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
  The first ""walm"" follows two unique words ""dax"" and ""zup"", resulting in three ""yellow"". The second ""walm"" comes after four unique words, ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""walm"" (as its own counter), and ""wif"", resulting in four ""red"".

Based on the above observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be consistently applied as stated.",-8.137238123598,64,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in the inputs and outputs:

- Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
- Input: zup walm dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
- Input: lug wif walm -> Output: blue red red red
- Input: zup walm lug -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
- Input: dax zup walm wif walm -> Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red

The presence of ""walm"" in the inputs always seems to correspond to repeated color outputs in sequence, particularly ""yellow"" or ""red"". Notably, ""walm"" does not have an individual output associated with it (unlike ""zup"" -> yellow, ""lug"" -> blue, ""wif"" -> red, ""dax"" -> green); instead, it affects the sequence of colors outputted thereafter.

In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug zup wif dax,"" and the colors are ""blue yellow red green."" When ""walm"" next appears, the color sequence repeats from ""lug"" as blue and immediately follows ""walm"" (yellow). The same pattern follows for ""wif"" after ""walm"" where the pattern red-red starts right after the ""walm"".

By these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" instructs to repeat the color output of the following word. If the next word itself means a color, ""walm"" causes that color to repeat. The repetition count seems to be three based on the data.

- ""wif"" corresponds to red, and when ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it repeats ""red"" (3 times in total).
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" repeats that color (3 times in total when alone).
- ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" increases the count of ""blue.""
- There is no direct output for ""walm"" after ""dax,"" but the pattern seems to indicate that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the previous word or sequence.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color associated with the previous word. If ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence, it extends the last mentioned color by one more repetition.",-5.110229172823,65,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" To do this, we look at where ""walm"" appears in the inputs and what is produced in the outputs:

1. Input: wif walm lug bluf - Output: red red red blue blue
2. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm - Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
3. Input: zup walm - Output: yellow yellow yellow
4. Input: zup dax walm zup wif - Output: yellow green green green yellow red
5. Input: wif walm dax zup - Output: red red red green yellow

From the examples, it seems that the appearance of ""walm"" in the input corresponds to a repetition of the color that precedes it in the output. Let's verify this:

""1. wif (red) walm(lug) lug (red) bluf (blue blue)""
""2. wif (red) zup(bluf) bluf(blue) lug(red) walm(lug)""
""3. zup (yellow) walm(zup)""
""4. zup (yellow) dax(green) walm(dax) zup (yellow) wif(red)""
""5. wif (red) walm(wif) dax (green) zup(yellow)""

From the above dissection, ""walm"" seems to be a function word that translates to ""repeat the color of the previous word,"" with the number of repetitions equal to the number of syllables in that previous word, seen clearly in example 1.

This rule holds up in every example given. For example, in input 1, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and the output is ""red red red,"" a tripling of ""red."" In input 5, ""walm"" again follows ""wif"" and we again see ""red red red"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word, with the number of repetitions equal to the number of syllables in that previous word.",-7.200294137039998,65,walm
"To deduce the rule for the word ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns of output associated with the word ""walm"" in the given input sequences.

Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Looking at the patterns:

- Each time ""wif"" is mentioned, the color ""red"" is outputted once.
- Each time ""zup"" is mentioned, the color ""yellow"" is outputted once.
- Each time ""lug"" is mentioned, the color ""blue"" appears once.
- Each time ""dax"" is mentioned, the color ""green"" appears once.
- ""bluf"" seems to create the color ""blue"" twice.

Now, looking specifically at where walm appears and the output associated:

- walm follows ""wif"" and precedes ""lug"" - The output is three reds before the blue for lug.
- walm is at the end, following ""lug"" - The output is an extra blue after the standard pattern.
- walm follows ""zup"" without any subsequent word - The output is an extra yellow.
- walm follows ""zup"" and ""dax"" and is followed by another ""zup"" - The output after ""dax"" is an additional green before resuming the pattern.
- walm follows ""wif"" and ""dax"" and precedes ""zup"" - The output is an additional red before proceeding with dax and zup colors.

Considering these observations, it appears that ""walm"" duplicates the color output of the word that either immediately follows or precedes it. If ""walm"" is at the end of the input, it duplicates the last color mentioned before it. If walm is at the beginning of a sequence which seems less likely given provided examples, it might duplicate the color of the word following it.

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to the color red being repeated thrice.

There might be additional context or rules governing the behavior of other words in the examples, which result in other color outputs such as green for ""dax,"" yellow for ""zup,"" and blue for ""bluf.""

Using this analysis, we can define the meaning of ""walm"" in the context of these examples:

"Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""walm.""

1. In every instance of ""walm,"" the word preceding ""walm"" is repeated in the output with its respective color. That is, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" with the repetition of ""red,"" and ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" with the repetition of ""yellow.""

2. The color repetition is three times, regardless of whether the word before ""walm"" appears one or more times.

3. No matter the position of ""walm"" in the input, the rule of repeating the color of the previous word three times in the output remains consistent.

Based on this analysis, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color associated with the preceding word to be outputted three times consecutively.

"Based on the examples provided, ""zup"" appears to correspond to the color yellow. However, there seems to be an additional rule that when ""zup"" appears, the following word's associated color is also repeated until a new color (or ""zup"") appears. 

Here's the breakdown:

- Example 1: ""wif"" leads to red, followed by ""zup"" which is yellow, and then ""walm"" would be red, but it is repeated three times because it follows ""zup"".
- Example 2: ""lug"" is blue, ""zup"" is yellow, and then ""lug"" is blue again (no repetition as it is the same color that preceded ""zup"").
- Example 3: ""lug"" is blue, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""walm"" would be yellow, but it is repeated three times (here both ""zup"" and ""walm"" appear to generate yellow, but ""walm"" is influenced by the presence of ""zup"").
- Example 4: ""dax"" is green, ""walm"" is green, and ""zup"" is yellow with no further repetition (as ""zup"" is the last word).
- Example 5: ""wif"" is red, ""zup"" is yellow, ""bluf"" would be blue, but it's repeated twice because it follows ""zup"", ""lug"" is blue but not repeated (as it is the same color that preceded it), and ""walm"" is blue but repeated once due to following ""bluf"" (though this also follows the pattern that has been deduced).

- When an input item repeats, the corresponding output color also seems to repeat, such as ""walm"" outputting ""red"" multiple times or ""lug"" outputting ""blue"" multiple times.

- When different input items are present, they correspond to different colors, such as ""wif"" corresponding to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""walm"" to ""red.""

"Rule: bluf -> blue blue

Based on the given examples, every occurrence of the nonce word 'bluf' corresponds to two instances of 'blue' in the output. Here's how it is reflected in the examples:

- Example 1: ""dax bluf wif zup"" translates to ""green green red yellow,"" and since 'dax' corresponds to 'green,' and 'wif' and 'zup' correspond to 'red' and 'yellow' respectively, 'bluf' must correspond to the remaining 'green green,' which in this case we interpret as a repetition of the color 'blue' because 'green' is already taken by 'dax.'
- Example 2: ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" following the same logic 'dax' is 'green' and 'bluf' must be 'blue blue.'
- Example 3: ""dax bluf lug wif"" translates to ""green green blue red,"" 'dax' is 'green,' 'lug' is 'blue,' 'wif' is 'red,' and 'bluf' corresponds to 'blue blue.'
- Example 4: ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue blue,"" 'lug' is 'blue,' 'walm' is 'blue,' 'wif' is 'red,' thus 'bluf' must be 'blue blue' since it adds two 'blue' to the sequence.
- Example 5: ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" translates to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue,"" 'wif' is 'red,' 'zup' is 'yellow,' 'lug' is 'blue,' and 'walm' is 'blue,' hence 'bluf' contributes 'blue blue' to the pattern.

In conclusion, 'bluf' repeatedly produces 'blue blue' in the output.",-0.9123034714399999,66,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that each word is assigned a consistent color. Given this observation, it is possible to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" by looking at the color it corresponds to across different examples:

Input: dax bluf lug wif | Output: green green blue red
Input: lug walm wif lug bluf | Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

From the above examples:

- ""dax"" consistently maps to the color green.
- ""wif"" consistently maps to the color red.
- ""zup"" consistently maps to the color yellow.

- ""wif bluf dax walm"" becomes ""red red green green green"", with ""dax walm"" translating to ""green green green"".
- ""dax walm"" matches ""green green green"" directly.
- ""zup wif walm lug"" changes to ""yellow red red red blue"", with ""wif walm"" translating to ""red red red"".

Hence, in each case, ""walm"" follows a color word and results in that color word being output three times.",-0.782861232652,66,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look for patterns related to the word and its associated colors in each example:

- In every instance where ""walm"" appears, there is a corresponding sequence of ""green"" in the output.

Now, looking at the contexts in which ""walm"" appears, it follows the word ""dax"" in all but one instance. Furthermore, ""dax"" is always followed by ""green"" as well. Let's break down each input and its output:

1. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" results in ""green green green yellow blue blue blue."" 
   - The sequence of three ""green"" corresponds with ""dax walm.""
   - ""zup"" results in a ""yellow.""
   - ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to one ""blue"" and ""walm"" possibly corresponds to the remaining two ""blue.""

2. ""wif bluf dax walm"" results in ""red red green green green."" 
   - ""wif"" results in ""red.""
   - ""bluf"" results in ""red.""
   - ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green."" 

3. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green."" 
   - The entire output corresponds to ""dax walm.""

4. ""zup wif walm lug"" results in ""yellow red red red blue.""
   - ""zup"" results in ""yellow.""
   - ""wif"" results in ""red.""
   - ""walm lug"" ends with ""red blue,"" suggesting ""lug"" is ""blue"" and hinting that ""walm"" could be the preceding ""red.""

5. ""lug wif dax walm zup"" results in ""blue red green green green yellow.""
   - ""lug"" results in ""blue.""
   - ""wif"" results in ""red.""
   - ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green.""
   - ""zup"" results in ""yellow.""

From this, we can deduce that ""dax"" by itself corresponds to one green, and when followed by ""walm,"" there are two additional greens. This suggests ""walm"" corresponds to two additional green outputs following ""dax."" However, when ""walm"" is not preceded by ""dax,"" such as in inputs 1 and 4, the outputs are not consistent with the ""green green green"" pattern, indicating that ""walm"" might have different meanings or functions depending on its position or neighboring words.

The multiple interpretations from these inputs make it challenging to derive a single, consistent rule for ""walm."" The only consistent pattern is that if ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" it produces two additional greens. Without further context or examples, particularly examples where ""walm"" does not follow ""dax,"" we cannot definitively state what ""walm"" means when it doesn't follow ""dax"". But when it does follow ""dax,"" it seems to mean:

Rule: When following ""dax,"" ""walm"" means two additional instances of ""green.""",-0.929038409598,66,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the input and corresponding output patterns:

1. dax walm zup lug walm -> green green green yellow blue blue blue
2. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
3. dax walm -> green green green
4. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
5. lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow

Analyzing the patterns, we can see that each appearance of ""walm"" corresponds to a series of ""green""s in the output. The quantity of green that follows is dependent on the word that appears directly before ""walm"". If we count the number of green, it corresponds to the position of the word before ""walm"" in the input sequence (considering the first word as position 1). 

1. ""dax"" comes first and is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in three greens.
2. ""dax"" comes third and is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in three greens again.
3. ""dax"" comes first and is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in three greens.
4. ""wif"" comes second and is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in two greens.
5. ""dax"" comes third and is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in three greens again.

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the output of a number of green equal to the position of the previous word in the input sequence. 

Rule: walm -> output green for a number of times equal to the position of the preceding word in the input sequence.",-1.180374967714,66,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" affects the color output associated with the preceding word(s). To deduce the rule behind ""walm"", let's analyze each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

   Here, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" and is repeated three times as green. ""zup"" without ""walm"" is yellow, but then ""lug"" followed by ""walm"" results in blue being repeated three times.

2. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

   ""wif"" and ""bluf"" are not followed by ""walm"" and are red. However, ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" results in green repeated three times.

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

   ""Dax"" followed by ""walm"" again results in green repeated three times.

4. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue

   ""zup"" is yellow without ""walm."" However, ""wif' followed by ""walm"" leads to red being repeated three times, and ""lug"" by itself is blue.

5. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow

   ""Lug"" by itself is blue, ""wif"" alone is red, but ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" makes green repeat three times. ""Zup"" at the end is yellow.

Considering the pattern seen across these examples, ""walm"" seems to cause the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it to be repeated three times. If a word is not directly followed by ""walm"", its color is mentioned only once.

Rule: When a word is followed by ""walm,"" the corresponding color of that word is outputted three times in succession. If a word is not followed by ""walm,"" its color is outputted just once.

Hence, the meaning is:

walm -> Causes the preceding word's color to be repeated three times.",-6.1856943506789985,66,walm
"To figure out what ""walm"" means, let's examine each input and corresponding output closely, looking for patterns that correlate with the presence of ""walm"":

1. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   
2. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

4. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue

5. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow

From the examples, it appears that ""walm"" correlates with the word ""green"" in the outputs:

- Every time ""dax"" appears before ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" appears at the end of a sequence, the last color before ""walm"" is repeated (except for the first example with ""lug walm"" yielding ""blue blue blue"").
- In the fourth example, even though ""walm"" does not appear at the end, ""red"" is still repeated before switching to ""blue"", which may be correlated with ""lug"".

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" is an instruction to repeat the color corresponding to the word that appears immediately before it. However, there are discrepancies in how this rule applies (like in the first example). Let's refine the rule for better accuracy:

- ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the previous word (if ""dax"" is before ""walm,"" then ""green"" is repeated).
- When ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" it does not follow the direct repetition; rather, ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to repeat multiple times.
- The first word before ""walm"" determines the color to be repeated unless the word is ""lug,"" which results in multiple ""blue"" regardless of its position relative to ""walm.""

Let's create a more concise rule:

Rule: ""walm"" instructs to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it, with an exception that if ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is multiple ""blue."" If ""dax"" is before ""walm,"" the color ""green"" is repeated three times.

Therefore:

1. ""lug walm"" consistently leads to two blue outputs.

4. ""lug"" does not seem to change its resultant output color based on what follows or precedes it.

Given these observations, we can deduce that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Thus, the rule we've extracted is:

"Analyzing the given examples, it seems that for every instance of the nonce word ""dax,"" it gets translated in the output into a color. By comparing the instances of ""dax"" with its corresponding output, we can determine its meaning.

Here are the outcomes next to each instance where ""dax"" is used:

1. wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   - ""dax"" comes before ""lug"" and ""lug"" translates to ""green,"" so ""dax"" should mean ""blue"" since the output color sequence that matches is ""blue blue.""

2. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
   - Here, ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the sequence is ""green blue."" Since we know ""lug"" is ""green,"" ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

3. dax wif -> green red
   - We know ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" meaning ""dax"" must be ""green"" here.

4. wif dax bluf -> red green green
   - ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""bluf"" has translated to ""green"" in the first example where ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"". In this sequence, ""dax"" therefore translates to ""green.""

5. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
   - ""wif"" and ""bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" and following their appearance ""dax"" leads to a ""green"" again and the ""walm"" element which follows ""dax"" also translates to ""green.""

In all instances except the first, ""dax"" translates directly to ""green."" Given the inconsistency in the first instance, it is possible that there is a contextual rule for ""dax's"" meaning. The rule could be related to the position of ""dax"" within the sequence or the words that come just before or after ""dax."" However, with the information provided, the rule isn't entirely clear.

Given that ""dax"" turns into ""green"" in every instance except for the sequence of ""dax lug,"" where it translates to ""blue blue,"" it could be hypothesized that there is a repetition rule involved when ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" or it could be an error in the dataset.

We can observe that whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""green."" None of the contexts around ""dax"" seem to change this output, which suggests that ""dax"" directly translates to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position or the surrounding words.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green",-7.253434080322002,67,dax
"Based on the examples given, each instance of ""dax"" leads to the output ""green"".

However, ""dax"" is not simply a direct replacement for ""green"" because other non-""dax"" words (like ""lug"" and ""walm"") are also translated to ""blue"", so ""dax"" must carry some additional rule. To discern the rule, let's look at how outputs change with or without ""dax"":

1. ""lug"" tends towards ""blue"", but when preceded by ""dax"", it outputs ""green"".
2. ""walm"" also tends to ""blue"", but when it either follows ""dax"" or ""dax lug"", it also outputs ""green"".
3. ""wif"" on its own translates to ""red"". But when followed by ""dax"", the output is ""green"" instead.

It seems that the presence of ""dax"" affects the color output of the subsequent word or the sequence (at least for one word after ""dax""). Given these examples, the simplest rule that can be deduced for ""dax"" is that it changes the color output of the following word to ""green"", regardless of what the color would normally be.

Therefore, we can write the rule as:

Rule: When ""dax"" precedes another word, that following word's output is changed to ""green"".",-8.505948122732,67,dax

"From the given examples, ""zup"" is consistently associated with the same output. By examining each case, we can identify the pattern:

- In the first example, ""dax wif zup dax"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". The word ""zup"" falls between ""wif"" and ""dax"" and results in ""yellow"". 

- In the second example, ""lug dax zup dax wif"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""zup"" is again followed by the color ""yellow"".

- The third example, ""dax zup lug wif zup"", confirms the previous associations with ""dax"", ""lug"", and ""wif"". ""Zup"" continues to correspond to ""yellow"".

- The fourth example, ""dax zup"", further strengthens the direct association of ""dax"" with ""green"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow"".

- The fifth example, ""zup wif bluf zup"", is the only one introducing a new word, ""bluf"". ""Wif"" remains associated with ""red"" and ""zup"" continues to produce ""yellow"".

"Based on the given examples, we can observe the appearance of the nonce word ""bluf"" and its corresponding output color. By analyzing each instance, we can attempt to deduce the rule behind the word ""bluf."" 

Let's consider each input where ""bluf"" is present:

1. In example one, ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"".
2. In example two, ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"".
3. In example three, ""bluf"" translates to ""red"".
4. In example four, ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"".
5. In example five, ""bluf"" translates to ""red"".

It appears that ""bluf"" does not correspond to a consistent color in the output. However, we might infer that ""bluf"" translates to the same color as the word that immediately precedes it in the input sequence. To confirm this, let's re-examine the examples:

1. dax zup lug zup **bluf** → green yellow blue yellow **yellow**
2. wif zup **bluf** lug walm dax lug → red yellow **yellow** blue blue blue green blue
3. wif **bluf** lug zup → red **red** blue yellow
4. dax lug **bluf** → green blue **blue**
5. zup wif dax wif **bluf** → yellow red green red **red**

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word immediately preceding it.",-1.2443049213640003,67,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the given examples and their corresponding outputs. We'll analyze word by word to see how the outputs relate to the inputs.

- In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" again corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

The word ""bluf"" does not consistently correspond to the same color output. This suggests that the meaning of ""bluf"" is dependent on the context in which it appears.

Upon closer examination of the examples provided, we can see that the output color for the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the immediately preceding word:

- In the first example: ""lug zup bluf"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow.""
- In the second example: ""wif zup bluf"" translates to ""red yellow yellow.""
- In the third example: ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red.""
- In the fourth example: ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue.""
- In the fifth example: ""wif dax wif bluf"" translates to ""red green red red.""

Based on this pattern, ""bluf"" appears to repeat the color represented by the preceding word. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is that it takes on the same color as the previous word.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the preceding word.",-6.42015579886,67,bluf
"Based on the examples given, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" correlates with the color ""blue"" in the outputs.

Let's consider each example:

1. Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
   Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow
   * Here, every word is single-mapped to a color except ""bluf"" which corresponds to ""blue"".

2. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   * ""bluf"" appears right before the first instance of ""blue"" in the output.

3. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow
   * ""bluf"" directly corresponds to the second ""red"" in the output, which represents ""blue"".

4. Input: dax lug bluf
   Output: green blue blue
   * ""bluf"" again matches ""blue"".

5. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf

   * In this example, ""bluf"" corresponds to the last ""red"", odd given our previous observations. However, given that every other example supports ""bluf"" equaling ""blue,"" this can be seen as an anomaly, possibly a typo or error in the instructions.

With the exception of Example 5, which likely contains an error, all other examples consistently show that ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"". Therefore, the induction of the rule based on the given examples leads to the conclusion:

Rule: bluf -> blue",-7.247527845639,67,bluf

1. In every input, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""blue.""
2. ""Bluf"" does not seem to follow a rule based on its position; it always results in ""blue"" regardless of where it is in the sequence.

- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"", the output is multiple blues.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", the output is multiple reds.

Let's review the examples to solidify the rule:

- In example 1, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the color for ""zup"" is yellow, therefore the output is a series of yellows.
- In example 2, ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" with ""dax"" corresponding to green, so the output is green followed by yellows.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the outputs corresponding to the presence of ""walm"" in the inputs. Here are the observations:

1. When ""lug walm"" is the input, the output is ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting that ""lug"" might represent ""blue"" and ""walm"" could imply repeating that color thrice.

2. In ""wif walm zup walm,"" we see ""red red red yellow yellow yellow"" in the output. ""wif"" seems to represent ""red"" and ""zup"" represents ""yellow,"" with ""walm"" apparently causing both colors to be repeated thrice.

3. In ""wif dax zup walm,"" which outputs ""red green yellow yellow yellow,"" ""wif"" seems to stand for ""red,"" ""dax"" for ""green,"" and ""zup"" for ""yellow."" Here, ""walm"" seems to cause the preceding color (""yellow"") to repeat two more times, for a total of three times.

5. Lastly, ""wif walm dax zup"" results in ""red red red green yellow,"" where ""walm"" again seems to triple the color before it (""red""), but does not affect ""green,"" which comes after a non-""walm"" element (""dax"").

Based on these observations, we can rule out ""walm"" causing repetition of a specific color or being independent of context, as it consistently repeats the color mentioned before it. Also, the repetition only occurs with the previous color mentioned, not with any subsequent ones.

Output: blue blue blue
- ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.

Input: wif walm zup walm
Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow

2. Input: ""wif walm zup walm""

3. Input: ""wif dax zup walm""
   - ""wif"" is associated with red.
   - ""dax"" is associated with green.
   - ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" which results in the word ""yellow"" repeated three times because ""zup"" is associated with yellow.

Rule: wif -> red.",-0.43444268169699995,69,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's analyze the given inputs and their corresponding outputs.

1. ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" appears before ""walm"" and after ""bluf,"" which results in ""red red red.""
- Looks like ""wif"" in this context could be indicating a repetition or a changer.

2. ""wif zup walm dax zup"" translates to ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow.""
- ""wif"" at the beginning is followed by ""red.""
- The pattern isn't immediately clear, but let's keep looking.

3. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red green green green blue.""
- ""wif"" comes after ""zup"" and is followed by ""red.""
- Similar to example 1, ""wif"" could be affecting the words following it, causing them to repeat their corresponding colors.

4. ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" translates to ""blue red red green blue blue.""
- ""lug"" is blue, but again ""wif"" is followed by ""red.""

5. ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green.""
- ""wif"" is followed by ""dax"" and translates to ""red green.""
- Seems like ""wif"" might be causing a change in pattern following it.

Analyzing the patterns, it seems:
- When ""wif"" is preceded by ""bluf,"" ""walm,"" or ""lug,"" it translates to ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""dax,"" it translates to ""red green,"" indicating perhaps a start of a new sequence or a pattern change.

However, the pattern is not entirely consistent. Without further examples, it's difficult to ascertain if ""wif"" is a singular color or a pattern changer. Let's assume it acts as a pattern changer.

Rule: ""wif"" initiates a change in the established pattern or introduces a new sequence that alters the output colors following it.",-1.217141125724,69,wif
"To deduce what the nonce word ""wif"" means, I'll look for patterns in how it connects with output colors in the examples provided:

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm -> Output: yellow yellow red red red
2. Input: wif zup walm dax zup -> Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
3. Input: zup wif dax walm lug -> Output: yellow red green green green blue
4. Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf -> Output: blue red red green blue blue
5. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

From these examples, it looks like ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the output, regardless of the surrounding words. Each time ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" is awarded in the output:

- In examples 1, 3, 4, and 5, ""wif"" maps to ""red"".
- ""wif"" appears to have no impact on the color output of the words that follow it; it has a consistent output.

Given this information, the rule we can infer is:

Rule: wif -> red

This rule seems to hold true across all the examples provided.",-7.685787572770998,69,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that each word corresponds to a color, with ""wif"" selectively representing different colors depending on its position relative to certain other words. To determine the rule for ""wif"", let's examine the examples:

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

   In this sequence, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""bluf"" also corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" corresponds to red. Since ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and correlates with additional reds following it, we can assume for this example that ""wif"" causes the output of the color red for itself and any following instances of ""walm"".

2. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

   Here, ""wif"" comes at the beginning and corresponds to red, while ""zup"" again corresponds to yellow, ""walm"" to yellow (a change from the previous instance where it was red), and ""dax"" to green. The appearance of ""wif"" here does not seem to affect the colors that come after it in any consistent manner found in the first example.

3. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue

   In this sequence, ""wif"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and precedes ""dax"" (green), but ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""walm"" correlates with green this time, and ""lug"" with blue. There's no discernible effect on the colors that follow ""wif"" here.

4. Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
   Output: blue red red green blue blue

   ""Lug"" corresponds to blue and ""bluf"" also to blue, while ""wif"" corresponds to red and is followed by ""bluf"", which here also corresponds to red instead of blue like in other instances. ""Dax"" is green. Again, ""wif"" causes a change in the color of ""bluf"" but only immediately following it.

5. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

   ""Wif"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and precedes ""dax"" (green), where ""wif"" itself corresponds to red.

From these examples, we can deduce that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red. However, the effect ""wif"" has on the subsequent words is not entirely clear, as it doesn't always change the following word's associated color or have a consistent effect. The most consistent rule we can derive is:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.

Therefore:
wif -> red",-8.099063594278,69,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the meaning of ""wif"" depends on the word that follows it. The pattern suggests that ""wif"" takes the word after it and converts the output color to red if it would normally be yellow; otherwise, it remains unchanged. Let's examine the evidence:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red red red,"" which can be interpreted as a transformation because ""walm"" normally seems to correspond to ""yellow"" as can be seen in other examples where ""walm"" is on its own like in the second example.

2. In the second example, ""zup"" follows ""wif,"" and the output for ""zup"" is ""yellow"" but changes to ""red"" immediately after ""wif.""

3. In the third example, ""dax"" follows ""wif,"" but there is no change (""green"" remains ""green"") because ""dax"" does not normally correspond to ""yellow.""

4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which is originally ""yellow"" but changes to ""red"" when it comes after ""wif.""

5. In the fifth example, ""dax"" again follows ""wif,"" and like before, there is no change to the output color (""green"" remains ""green"").

So, the rule is: if the word following ""wif"" normally corresponds to ""yellow,"" then ""wif"" changes that output to ""red."" If the word following ""wif"" corresponds to any other color, ""wif"" does not change the output.

Rule: wif -> If the succeeding word's output color is yellow, change it to red; otherwise, leave it unchanged.",-9.791159287758001,69,wif

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word 'bluf', let's look at the correspondence between the inputs and outputs:

- When 'dax' is present, the output has 'green'.
- When 'zup' is present, the output has 'yellow'.
- When 'lug' is present, the output has 'blue'.
- When 'wif' is present, the output has 'red'.

Now, we examine the occurrences of 'bluf' and the corresponding output:

- In ""dax zup bluf"", the output is ""green yellow yellow"". Here, 'bluf' seems to correspond to an additional 'yellow', considering that 'zup' also translates to 'yellow'.
- In ""dax zup lug bluf"", the output is ""green yellow blue blue"". Again, 'bluf' adds an additional 'blue' after 'lug', which itself corresponds to 'blue'.
- In ""wif bluf"", the output is ""red red"". 'bluf' corresponds to an additional 'red', matching the output for 'wif'.
- In ""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax"", the output sequence matches the input, with 'bluf' taking on the color of the word preceding it (blue after 'lug', yellow after 'zup').
- In ""zup bluf"", the output is ""yellow yellow"". This further supports our observation that 'bluf' repeats the color of the word before it.

Thus, the rule for the nonce word 'bluf' seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. 'Bluf' repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it.",-2.6130946705599998,69,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, there is a pattern where the word ""bluf"" seems to be translating to the color word that comes before it (if any). If ""bluf"" is preceded by a color-associated word in the English language, it takes on this color's name in the output. If it's not directly preceded by a color-associated word, it repeats the color of the word before it. 

Let's look at the examples to clarify the rule:

1. Input: dax zup bluf 
   Output: green yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and then ""bluf"" repeats that color (""yellow"").

2. Input: dax zup lug bluf 
   Output: green yellow blue blue
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and then ""bluf"" repeats that color (""blue"").

3. Input: wif bluf 
   Output: red red
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and then ""bluf"" repeats that color (""red"").

4. Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax 
   Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" repeats that color (""blue""), ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" the next ""bluf"" repeats that color (""yellow""), and ""dax"" translates to ""green"".

5. Input: zup bluf 
   Output: yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and then ""bluf"" repeats that color (""yellow"").

Based on this pattern, it seems the rule for the word ""bluf"" is that it means ""repeat the color word directly preceding this one"". If there is no color directly before ""bluf,"" then it repeats the last color mentioned.

Now let's apply this rule to the examples:

Example 1: ""zup wif dax walm"" translates to ""yellow red green green green."" In this case, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the color green is repeated three times.
 
Example 2: ""zup wif lug zup walm"" translates to ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the color yellow is repeated three times.

Example 3: ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green."" ""Walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the color green is repeated three times.

Example 4: ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""Walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the color yellow is repeated three times.

Example 5: ""lug walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue."" ""Walm"" first follows ""lug,"" repeating blue three times, and the second ""walm"" also follows ""lug,"" repeating blue three more times.

2. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" yields ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" After ""walm,"" we see repeated ""yellow.""

"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the meaning of ""walm"" by observing the patterns of input and output.

In every instance, the output associated with ""walm"" is the repetition of a color word three times. It appears that the color word that is repeated three times is dependent on the word immediately preceding ""walm"":

- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green""
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""

The rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the previous word to be translated into its corresponding color and then that color word is repeated three times. The corresponding colors are:
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""lug"" -> blue

"Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" appears to encode a rule that dictates repeating the color associated with the previous word a number of times. Here's the breakdown of the rules inferred from the examples:

- ""zup wif dax walm"": The word ""dax"" translates to the color green, and following the word ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green,"" which suggests that ""walm"" causes the color of ""dax"" (green) to be repeated three times.
  
- ""zup wif lug zup walm"": The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue, and ""zup"" to yellow. Since ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output ""yellow yellow yellow"" indicates that ""walm"" causes the color of ""zup"" (yellow) to be repeated three times.

- ""dax walm"": With just the word ""dax"" followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green,"" again indicating three repetitions of ""dax""'s associated color.

- ""zup walm"": With ""zup"" followed by ""walm,"" we see the output ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which is also three repetitions of ""zup""'s associated color.

- ""lug walm zup lug walm"": Here, ""lug"" precedes the first occurrence of ""walm,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue,"" reinforcing the rule of threefold repetition. Later, after ""zup lug,"" ""lug"" is again followed by ""walm,"" resulting in another ""blue blue blue"" sequence, consistent with the previous pattern.

3. When ""lug walm"" occurs, the output is ""blue blue blue.""

From these observations, we can surmise the following:
- The presence of ""walm"" seems to cause the color word that precedes it to be repeated three times.
- The specific color that gets repeated is directly related to the word before ""walm"" (i.e., ""dax"" is to ""green,"" ""zup"" is to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is to ""blue"").

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Repeat the color of the most recent color word the number of times that the color word precedes it in the input sequence.

- wif is associated with red.
- zup is associated with yellow.
- dax, and bluf are not followed by walm in the examples given, so their interaction with walm is not demonstrated; however, we know from the first example that dax maps to green and bluf to red.

From the inputs and outputs, the rules appear to be:

- If lug comes before walm, the output is blue repeated three times.
- If wif comes before walm, the output is red repeated three times.
- If zup comes before walm, the output is yellow repeated three times.

In example 2, ""lug"" which translates to ""blue"" is followed by ""walm"" and the output is ""blue blue blue"".
In example 3, ""wif"" which translates to ""red"" is followed by ""walm"" and the output is ""red red red"".

"From the given examples, ""walm"" appears to replicate the color associated with the word that precedes it. Therefore, each time ""walm"" is used after a word, it takes on the color that is the output for the preceding word:

- In ""wif walm"", ""wif"" outputs red and ""walm"" also outputs red.
- In ""zup walm"", ""zup"" outputs yellow and ""walm"" also outputs yellow.
- In the first example, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"", between the third ""zup"" and ""dax"", ""walm"" takes the color of ""zup"" which is yellow.

2. lug dax lug -> blue green blue
3. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
4. dax walm -> green green green
5. dax lug wif -> green blue red

If we pay close attention, ""dax"" seems to be associated with the color ""green"" each time it appears, regardless of its position in the sequence. It consistently leads or follows other words yet retains the green designation. Other words, like ""lug"" and ""walm,"" correspond to blue, while ""wif"" is associated with red.

The sequence ""walm"" after ""dax"" repeats the color associated with ""dax,"" which in this case is green, for the same number of letters contained in ""walm.”

Rule:

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we need to analyze the provided examples and identify patterns corresponding to the outputs:

1. When ""dax"" appears twice separated by ""walm"" and ""zup,"" the corresponding output includes two instances of green, followed by green, yellow, blue, green. However, ""lug"" which is also present and is followed by ""dax,"" corresponds to blue green.
2. When ""lug"" and ""dax"" are alternating, each ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""dax"" corresponds to green.
3. ""dax lug walm"" results in green, followed by three blues; ""walm"" when preceded by ""lug"" seems to produce additional blue outputs.
4. ""dax walm"" leads to three greens, this repetition could imply that ""walm"" following ""dax"" reinforces or repeats the ""green"" output.
5. ""dax lug wif"" results in green, blue, and red. Since ""wif"" is a new element with no precedent, it likely corresponds to red.

Considering these observations, ""dax"" consistently results in ""green."" The pattern suggests that independent of its position, ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green."" Further context for ""walm,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif"" is needed to fully understand their corresponding outputs, but for the nonce word ""dax,"" we have a clear rule:

Rule: dax -> green.",-4.427638159580001,71,dax
"From analyzing the examples provided, it seems that the word ""dax"" doesn't correspond to a static meaning, but rather to a rule that affects the output. Here's what can be surmised:

1. Whenever ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is a repetition of ""green.""
2. The output ""green"" consistently appears after ""dax"" regardless of what follows, suggesting that ""dax"" on its own corresponds to ""green.""
3. ""lug"" after ""dax"" results in ""green blue,"" suggesting that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
4. ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red.""

Given these observations, we can derive the following rules:

- ""dax"" on its own corresponds to ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is followed by another word, it seems to produce ""green"" followed by the color associated with the next word. 
- The word ""walm"" following ""dax"" results in repeated ""green,"" which might imply that ""walm"" has no associated color but instead repeats the color produced by ""dax.""
- In scenarios where ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" ""dax"" generates its associated color (""green"") and also leads to the expression of the color associated with ""lug"" (""blue"").

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and when followed by another word, it outputs ""green"" once followed by the color corresponding to the next word. If the next word is ""walm,"" it causes a repetition of ""green"" instead of introducing a new color.",-6.519820746820001,71,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we should look at the consistent patterns presented in the examples provided.

1. In examples where ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is always ""green green green."" This could imply that ""dax walm"" translates into a sequence of green.
2. When ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" as in ""dax lug"" or ""lug dax lug,"" ""lug"" consistently translates to blue, whereas ""dax"" leads to green.
3. ""dax"" preceding other words seems to always lead to ""green"" being the first color in the output sequence.

Given these observations, it seems that the word ""dax"" translates directly to ""green,"" while the words that follow ""dax"" provide the subsequent colors in the sequence. 

Based on this, the rule appears to be:

Rule: dax -> green",-6.6113530764399995,71,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following:

- Whenever the input contains ""dax,"" the corresponding output begins with ""green.""
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- The word ""walm"" corresponds to multiple ""green"" outputs following it (two additional ""green"" in the output per each ""walm"" in the input).
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

From the examples, we can deduce that ""dax"" dictates that the output will start with ""green,"" but the exact meaning is not clear beyond that since ""dax"" is influencing the color sequence starting with green but is not directly translated to a sequence of colors beyond the first ""green.""

Rule: dax -> The output will begin with green. The exact influence of ""dax"" on the sequence following it is unclear, but it establishes ""green"" as the starting color.",-6.85689596899,71,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's compare the input and output of each example provided:

1. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red
2. wif dax zup walm -> red green yellow yellow yellow
3. lug zup wif zup -> blue yellow red yellow
4. lug wif -> blue red
5. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red

Now, let's analyze:

- In examples 1 and 3, ""zup"" appears before and after ""wif"" and translates to ""yellow"" before ""wif"" and ""yellow"" after ""wif"". But when ""wif"" follows ""zup,"" we always have ""red"" in the output.
- In example 2, ""wif"" precedes ""dax"" and the output starts with ""red"". In example 1, ""wif"" follows ""dax"" and results in ""red"" in the output as well.
- In every instance, the word immediately following ""wif"" results in a ""red"" in the output.
- ""wif"" does not always correspond directly to ""red"", since ""wif"" must be followed by another word (as seen in example 4, ""lug wif"" does not translate to ""blue red red"").

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" causes the following word to translate to ""red"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> causes the following word to be output as ""red"".",-1.24214568466,71,wif
"From the examples provided, we can analyze the context in which the nonce word ""wif"" is used and its corresponding output to deduce its meaning or the rule it represents.

1. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red
2. wif dax zup walm -> red green yellow yellow yellow
3. lug zup wif zup -> blue yellow red yellow
4. lug wif -> blue red
5. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red

Let's note the pattern before and after ""wif"" appears.

- In example 1, ""wif"" appears twice. Following its first appearance is ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow. But immediately after ""wif,"" the output is red. Following the second occurrence of ""wif"" is ""walm,"" which is followed by two reds in the output.
- In example 2, ""wif"" is at the beginning, and its output is red.
- In examples 3 and 4, ""wif"" is followed by ""zup"" and there is no word after it, but the sequence is followed by red in the output. When it stands alone with ""lug,"" it also translates to red in the output.
- In example 5, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" and the output sequence includes a string of reds.

The consistent pattern is that ""wif"" corresponds with the output red, and in the case it's followed by ""walm,"" it seems to extend the output of reds.

Rule: wif -> red. When immediately followed by ""walm,"" it extends the red output by one more red.",-1.5653551654400002,71,wif
"Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" seems to correspond to the color red. Every time ""wif"" is used in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. Here is the evidence from the examples:

- In the first input, ""wif"" appears twice and both times ""red"" follows immediately after.
- In the second input, ""wif"" precedes a single ""red"" in the output.
- In the third input, ""wif"" again precedes a single ""red"" in the output.
- In the fourth input, ""wif"" is the only word following ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue red,"" where “lug” is not exhibited previously to be associated with ""red.""
- In the fifth and final example, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" and the output is ""red red red,"" indicating that ""wif"" could also mean “red” in this context.

Taking these observations together, it is reasonable to deduce that:

Rule: wif -> red",-8.17752223948,71,wif

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's analyze the outputs corresponding to the occurrences of ""wif"" in each input:

1. In the first example, the two occurrences of ""wif"" correspond to the outputs ""red"" and ""red,"" respectively.

2. In the second example, ""wif"" appears once and corresponds to ""red.""

3. In the third example, ""wif"" also corresponds to ""red.""

4. In the fourth example, there is only one ""wif,"" and it corresponds to ""red.""

5. In the fifth example, ""wif"" once again corresponds to a single output ""red.""

- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow""

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

"Based on the examples given, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that is mentioned right before it.

- In example one, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" follows it, resulting in ""red red"".
- In example two, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, followed by ""bluf"", resulting in ""blue blue"".
- In example three, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, followed by ""bluf"", resulting in ""yellow yellow"".
- In example four, ""wif"" corresponds to red, followed by ""bluf"", resulting in ""red red"".
- In example five, ""wif"" corresponds to red, but it's followed by ""lug"" (blue), then ""bluf"", resulting in ""red red blue"".

This suggests that the rule for ""bluf"" is to repeat the color of the previous word in the sequence, unless a new color word is introduced before ""bluf"", in which case ""bluf"" takes the color of the latest color word.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the word right before it.",-3.335011071468,71,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the output for the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the color associated with the word that comes directly before it. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""lug"" is associated with the color blue and it comes right before ""bluf,"" which translates to red. Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to take the color directly before it—blue—and then output the next color in a specific sequence.
- The same occurrence happens in the second example, where ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" and again the output colors are blue followed by blue (but this might be incidental, a repetition and not necessarily a rule).
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which is associated with yellow, and the output is yellow.
- The fourth example shows ""wif"" before ""bluf,"" with both translating to red.
- The fifth example has ""wif"" before ""bluf"" and then ""lug"" after ""bluf,"" resulting in red, red, and blue.

A potential consistent rule from this data is that ""bluf"" outputs the color corresponding to the word preceding it (with the exception of the first example where it translated to ""red"" after ""lug""). However, the first example's inconsistency (dax lug wif bluf -> green blue red red) suggests there might be another underlying rule, such as ""bluf"" might always translate to red unless another rule takes precedence. Without additional context or examples, particularly ones where ""bluf"" is the first word or no color precedes it, this ambiguity makes it hard to determine a definitive rule for all cases.

Given the above analysis and assuming the first example might contain an exception or error, the tentative rule for ""bluf"" is:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> meaning. ""bluf"" outputs the color corresponding to the previous word.",-4.1421834435400005,71,bluf
"Observing the patterns corresponding to each instance of ""bluf"" and the associated output, the output color appears to be related to the color given for the word immediately preceding ""bluf.""

- In the first example, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output for both is blue.
- In the second example, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" again, and the output for both is blue once more.
- In the third example, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output for both is yellow.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output for both is red.
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output for both is blue, matching the pattern from previous examples.

From these observations, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" translates to the same color as the word that comes before it.

"Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of ""walm"" by examining the context in which it appears and the corresponding output colors.

1. ""dax walm zup"" corresponds to ""green green green yellow"", and ""zup"" alone corresponds to ""yellow"", so ""dax"" likely means ""green"" and ""walm"" might be contributing to ""green"" as well, followed by ""zup"" being ""yellow"".

2. ""lug walm zup lug walm"" generates ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue"". Here, ""lug"" seems to mean ""blue"", ""zup"" still means ""yellow"", and ""walm"" again seems to contribute to the color ""green"" by preceding it with ""blue"".

3. ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"", and since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", in this instance, ""walm"" alone does not have an apparent effect on the output color.

4. ""dax walm wif bluf"" results in ""green green green red red"". Here ""dax"" is ""green"" and the appearance of ""walm"" continues the sequence of ""green"". Both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" result in ""red"", suggesting that they are unrelated to the word ""walm"".

5. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" becomes ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"". In this example, ""walm"", following ""zup"", seems to extend the sequence of the color ""yellow"".

From these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it carries the sequence of the color immediately before it. If it follows ""dax"" which means ""green"", the sequence of ""green"" continues. If it follows ""zup"" which is ""yellow"", the sequence of ""yellow"" continues. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" which is ""blue"", it instead results in the color ""green"", suggesting that the presence of ""walm"" after ""lug"" changes the output color specifically to green.

"Rule: walm -> repeated three times the color associated with the preceding word.

Explanation of the rule:
- In the first example, ""dax"" is associated with green, and after ""walm,"" we see ""green green green,"" indicating that ""walm"" causes the preceding color to be repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""lug"" is associated with blue, and after ""walm,"" we get ""blue blue blue,"" again suggesting that ""walm"" repeats the preceding color three times.
- In the third and fifth examples, ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" with ""yellow"" being the associated color for ""zup,"" and we see three ""yellow"" after ""walm,"" confirming the rule.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is associated with green and is followed by ""green green green"" whereas ""wif"" follows ""walm"" with no repetition of color, suggesting that ""walm"" only affects the preceding word.

Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be consistent: walm -> Repeats three times the color associated with the preceding word.",-4.904045752842,71,walm
"Based on the examples provided, each instance of ""walm"" corresponds to three green outputs in the pattern until it's followed by another word, in which case it ends with a yellow output (seen in the first and second examples), unless the word following it is ""wif"" or ""lug"" (seen in the fourth and fifth examples), in which case the sequence that corresponds to ""walm"" does not end with a yellow output.

From the third example, we can determine that ""zup walm"" consistently translates to three yellows. This means ""zup"" translates to yellow and ""walm"" retains its pattern of three greens when not followed by a word, except for ""wif"" or ""lug"". Then it's just green green green with no yellow at the end.

In the fourth example, ""wif"" is responsible for the output turning to red, and ""bluf"" continues the red output. The ""walm"" here again contributed three greens, and the change in output color occurred after ""wif"", not because of ""walm"".

Finally, in the fifth example, ""lug"" leads to blue, and ""zup"" again to yellow. ""wif"" is once again followed by red. The ""walm"" here offered its three greens, and the sequence does not end with a yellow since ""lug"" follows it, disrupting the usual ending pattern.

Considering all these facts, we can induce that the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: When ""walm"" is present, output is always three greens in succession, followed by a yellow only if the next word is not ""wif"" or ""lug"". If the word after ""walm"" is ""wif"" or ""lug"", the yellow is omitted.

The other words in the inputs also seem to correspond to colors but with different rules or quantities, as ""dax"" appears once and translates to one 'green', ""zup"" appears once and translates to three 'yellows', and ""lug"" appears once and translates to one 'blue', but when repeated it accounts for the repeating pattern.

2. lug walm wif → blue blue blue red
3. dax lug → green blue

"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to look for patterns across the examples that correlate with its use.

In the first example, ""dax"" is positioned between two ""zup"" occurrences, which correspond to two ""yellow"" outputs with a ""green"" output in the position of ""dax"":

Input: zup dax zup wif
Output: yellow green yellow red

In the second example, ""dax"" follows ""zup"" and precedes no word, resulting in a ""green"" output following a ""yellow"":

Input: dax zup
Output: green yellow

Thus far, ""dax"" correlates with ""green."" Let's look at more examples to confirm.

In the third example, ""dax"" follows two occurrences of ""zup"" and ""walm,"" each correlated with ""yellow,"" and precedes ""lug,"" which corresponds with ""blue"":

Input: zup walm dax lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

Again, we see ""dax"" aligns with ""green.""

In the fourth example, ""dax"" is the first word and is followed by ""wif,"" which corresponds with ""red"":

Input: dax wif
Output: green red

Here, ""dax"" at the start still produces a ""green"" output.

In the last example, ""dax"" is preceded by ""wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""walm""—all different—resulting in ""red,"" ""yellow,"" and ""yellow,"" respectively, and follows up with another ""yellow"":

Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

Each time ""dax"" is used, regardless of its position or the words around it, the output is ""green.""

Therefore, by induction, we can deduce that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" regardless of its placement or the preceding or following words. There is a direct and consistent mapping between ""dax"" and the color ""green"":

Rule: dax -> green",-5.916954009034,72,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds with the color green. Each time ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, ""green"" appears in the same position in the output.

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" is as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",-6.25666173675,72,wif
"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.",-6.53823485504,72,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Therefore, we can deduce the meaning of ""wif"" as follows:

"wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" This is evidenced by its consistent translation to ""red"" in each output regardless of the context it appears in.",-7.399590592579999,72,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""zup"" correlates to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Additionally, the provided inputs and outputs maintain a one-to-one relationship between each word and color except for the first example, which indicates that consecutive same words in the input are translated to consecutive same colors in the output.

To articulate this more formally:

- ""dax"" → ""green""
- ""wif"" → ""red""
- ""lug"" → ""blue""
- ""bluf"" and ""zup"" appear only once in a sentence that has corresponding colors; since ""bluf"" is directly followed by ""red"" in the output without another word in between, it indicates that ""bluf"" might translate to ""blue,"" which leaves ""zup"" to mean ""yellow"".

Thus, the rule seems to be:
zup -> yellow

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".",-8.19990309362,72,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" It does not appear to have a context-dependent meaning, as it yields the same result regardless of its position or surrounding words. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow",-8.359089777780001,72,zup
"Based on the examples provided, zup seems to correlate with the color yellow. Each instance where zup is presented in the input, the color yellow appears in the corresponding position of the output.

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" when it is preceded by the word ""dax"" but translates to ""blue"" in all other contexts. Here is how the rules apply to each example:

1. Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
   Output: blue green green yellow blue red
   - ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"".

2. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue
   - ""bluf"" on its own after ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".

3. Input: zup lug bluf
   Output: yellow blue blue
   - ""bluf"" on its own after ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".

4. Input: zup bluf wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow red red
   - The ""bluf"" after ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".
   - The ""bluf"" on its own translates to ""red"".
   - This example stands out as it contradicts the emerging rule, however, if we assume a mistake in the pattern, rest of the examples suggest ""bluf"" should mean ""blue"" as in other instances.

5. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
   Output: blue red green green red blue
   - ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"".

It seems there may be inconsistent information in the examples, specifically with the fourth example. If we exclude the fourth example as erroneous, we can conclude:

Rule: 
- ""bluf"" after ""dax"" means ""green"".
- ""bluf"" in all other contexts means ""blue"".

This analysis does not take into account the possibility of errors or exceptions in the examples, and that the fourth example stands out as potentially incorrectly given. If the fourth example is accurate, there would need to be an additional rule or exception to explain the inconsistency. However, with the information provided, we can only state the most straightforward rule as mentioned above. 

Bluf -> Green when preceded by dax; Blue in all other contexts.",-4.8125800375529995,72,bluf
"From the examples provided, we can deduce that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green"" when it follows certain words and to the color ""blue"" in other instances. Here's how we can break it down:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the corresponding output is ""green."" 
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" is repeated, and the output is ""blue blue,"" indicating that when ""bluf"" is either at the beginning or follows ""lug,"" its corresponding color is ""blue.""
3. The third example reinforces the rule from the second example, where ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and results in ""blue.""
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow,"" so when ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" its corresponding color is ""yellow.""
5. The fifth example shows ""bluf"" following ""dax"" again and the resulting color is ""green.""

Based on these observations, the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" seems to depend on the word that precedes it. Here's the summarised rule:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the color is ""blue.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the color is ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the color is ""yellow."" 

This is a complex pattern because the fourth example does not follow a clear rule based on precedents, so it offers conflicting information. But if we strictly follow the dominant patterns:

Rule:
- If ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it means ""green.""
- If ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" or is at the beginning, it means ""blue.""
- The instance where ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and yields ""yellow"" is conflicting and does not fit the pattern, suggesting there may be an error or an exception in this case.",-6.113213190207999,72,bluf

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns present in the examples provided:

- When ""dax walm wif zup"" is the input, the output is ""green green green red yellow""
  This implies that ""walm"" might be related to the repetition of the color associated with ""dax,"" which is green, before changing the pattern for ""wif"" and ""zup.""
  
- In ""lug walm zup,"" the output is ""blue blue blue yellow""
  Again, ""walm"" seems to induce a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word (""lug"" -> blue) prior to switching for ""zup.""

- ""dax wif walm"" results in ""green red red red""
  Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" instead of being next to ""dax,"" but the output is still predominantly red after ""wif.""

- ""lug wif walm"" results in ""blue red red red""
  As with the previous example, but with ""lug"" as the starting word, ""walm"" causes the output to be predominantly red following ""wif.""

- ""zup wif walm"" gives ""yellow red red red""
  Here, we see the pattern is consistent with previous examples when ""walm"" is in the position following ""wif""; the output is primarily red.

Based on these observations, it seems that the word ""walm"" functions to repeat the color of the word that appears just before ""walm."" However, when ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the pattern alters to produce red repeatedly. 

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word unless the preceding word is ""wif,"" in which case the color is red repeatedly.",-0.7141866391120001,72,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here's how the rule induction can be understood:

- In the first example, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and when ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the next three colors are also green.
- In the second example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" follows it, resulting in the next two colors being blue as well.
- In the third, fourth, and fifth examples, regardless of what the first word is, ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, followed by three repetitions of red.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the color corresponding to the word immediately before it to be repeated for the next few outputs.

Rule: walm -> causes a repetition of the preceding word's associated color.",-5.0084838759500006,72,walm
"Rule: walm -> a repeat of the color associated with the word immediately before it.

The examples show that whenever ""walm"" follows a word, the output color is a repeat of the color corresponding to the word that comes before ""walm"". For instance:

- In ""dax walm wif zup"", ""dax"" corresponds to green, and the color after ""walm"" is also green.
- In ""lug walm zup"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and the color after ""walm"" is also blue.
- In ""dax wif walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to red, and the color after ""walm"" is also red.
- In ""lug wif walm"", ""wif"" again corresponds to red, and the color after ""walm"" is also red.
- In ""zup wif walm"", ""wif"" once more corresponds to red, and the color after ""walm"" is also red.

Therefore, walm -> repeats the output color of the word that precedes it.",-5.800795683666,72,walm
"walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word. Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the output repeats the color associated with that word. So in each example, ""walm"" causes the previously mentioned color to be repeated in the output:

- In ""dax walm wif zup,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, so ""walm"" leads to another green.
- In ""lug walm zup,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""walm"" leads to another blue.
- In ""dax wif walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, so ""walm"" leads to another red.
- In ""lug wif walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, so ""walm"" leads to another red.
- In ""zup wif walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, so ""walm"" leads to another red.",-5.87824868507,72,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" corresponds to the color red being repeated three times in the output. It also seems that ""walm"" appears either after one or two other words that dictate the first color(s) in the output. These other words (""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""zup"") have their own corresponding colors as well (""dax"" corresponds to green, ""lug"" to blue, and ""zup"" to yellow), and their respective color appears in the output before the series of reds that result from ""walm.""

Thus, the rule appears to be as follows:

walm -> meaning: When ""walm"" is present in an input, it produces an output sequence of the color red repeated three times, regardless of the previous colors produced by other words in the input sequence.

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is used in the input, ""yellow"" is used in the corresponding output.

Rule: zup -> yellow",-6.338489789399999,73,zup
"Based on the examples provided, here is the rule I have induced:

When a word is followed by ""zup"", the output color for ""zup"" corresponds to the color of the word that comes after ""zup"". When ""zup"" is at the end or followed by an unseen word, the output color for ""zup"" is yellow.

Here's how the rule applies to each example:

- In ""dax zup dax"", ""zup"" is followed by ""dax"", which corresponds to green. Therefore the output for the first ""zup"" is yellow (its default color when followed by a known word) and the second ""zup"" mirrors ""dax"", which is green.

- In ""wif bluf zup bluf wif"", ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"", which corresponds to red. So ""zup"" output is yellow (its default color when followed by a known word) and ""bluf"" is red.

- In ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"", the first ""zup"" follows no word so its color is yellow by default, the second ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"", which is red, so ""zup"" takes on the default color yellow, and the last ""zup"" follows no word so it is yellow again following the default rule.

- In ""zup walm"", since ""walm"" is not preceded by another word with a defined color, ""zup"" and ""walm"" both take the default color yellow.

- In ""zup dax lug"", ""zup"" precedes ""dax"", which is defined as green, so ""zup"" takes the color yellow reflecting the rule, and ""lug"" has no previous color reference so it is assumed to have its unique color, blue, independent of the rule for ""zup"".

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" seems to be:
Rule: If ""zup"" is followed by a word whose color is known, ""zup"" takes the default color yellow. If ""zup"" comes at the end or is followed by an unseen word, it also has the default color yellow.",-6.9700688590599995,73,zup

"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can look at the patterns in the input and their corresponding outputs. It is helpful to identify the rule that leads from the ""Input"" to the ""Output"". Here's the pattern that emerges from the examples provided:

- In example 1, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""walm"" to ""red"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"". The word ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and results in an additional ""blue"".
- In example 2, the pattern is similar: ""wif"" is ""red"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", and ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" with another ""blue"".
- In example 3, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"". Again, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and results in ""yellow"". Notably, ""zup"" precedes and follows ""bluf"" here, with both instances of ""zup"" giving ""yellow"".
- In example 4, ""lug"" appears multiple times and is always ""blue"". Following ""lug"", ""bluf"" adds another instance of ""blue"".
- In example 5, ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""dax"" is ""green"", and ""lug"" is ""blue"". ""Bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" which results in ""green"".

From the examples given, ""bluf"" seems to act as a modifier or repeater for the color associated with ""lug"", which is ""blue"". However, we have an inconsistency in example 3 where ""bluf"" is followed by a repetition of the next word's color (""yellow""). Since this is a single instance that doesn't fit the pattern of the other examples, we might tentatively consider it an exception or an error. We will formulate the rule based on the majority pattern observed.

In every output, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" However, it's also important to note that ""bluf"" seems to add an additional ""blue"" at the end, not just a one-to-one correspondence.

Thus, the rule based on these examples for ""bluf"" appears to be that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue"" in the output, leading to a duplication of the word ""blue"" whenever ""bluf"" is encountered in the input.

Rule: bluf -> blue blue",-6.572369129419999,73,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word correlates to a color output. The word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color blue.

By examining the number and order of colors in the output in correlation with the presence of the word ""bluf,"" we can deduce that ""bluf"" translates into two instances of blue, each time it is used.

Here's the breakdown of the evidence for this conclusion:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" produces two blues at the end of the output sequence.
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" again results in two consecutive blues.
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" again corresponds to two blues, just that there are additional words/colors in the mix.

"Observing the provided examples:

- Example 1 lists ""wif walm"" resulting in ""red red red."" Since ""wif"" appears once and ""red"" appears three times, it is unclear how ""walm"" contributes to the output.
- Example 2 lists ""zup walm wif"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow red."" Since ""zup"" precedes ""walm wif,"" it corresponds to a sequence of three ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" at the end correlates with ""red.""
- Example 3 lists ""lug dax walm wif"" yielding ""blue green green green red."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" leads to two additional ""green"" after ""blue,"" and once again, ""wif"" appears at the end with ""red.""
- Example 4 only shows ""zup walm"" and results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which indicates that ""walm"" might not contribute to the output as ""zup"" has already determined the color sequence.
- Example 5 lists ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" resulting in ""blue blue red blue red red red blue."" In this case, ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" but the sequence of three ""red"" seems to also be influenced by the preceding appearance of ""walm.""

Considering the repetition and positions of the respective colors and the nonce word ""walm,"" one possible rule is that ""walm"" does not correspond to a color by itself, but rather repeats the last color mentioned before it. To confirm this, let's break down example 5 in particular, since it includes multiple instances and should help isolate the behavior of ""walm"":

- ""lug bluf wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue red"" (using prior deductions: ""lug"" -> ""blue"" and ""wif"" -> ""red"").
- After ""walm,"" the color ""red"" repeats three times despite only one appearance of ""wif.""
- Another ""lug"" after the sequence provides a ""blue"" at the end.

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to encode the rule to repeat the color corresponding to the previous word. 

Here is the breakdown:

In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, and saying ""walm"" after it results in ""red red red,"" indicating a repetition of red three times.

In the second example, ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and ""wif"" to red. Adding ""walm"" after ""zup wif"" repeats ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" indicating a repetition of yellow three times followed by red once.

The third example is similar. ""Lug"" corresponds to blue and ""dax"" to green, with ""walm"" after ""lug dax"" resulting in repeating green three times after repeating blue once and then ends with red which is the color for ""wif"" showing that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it but not preceding ""wif"".

The fourth example omits ""wif"" but includes ""zup"" and ""walm,"" where ""zup"" is yellow, so ""walm"" repeats yellow three times, which confirms the repetition pattern without an occurrence of red because ""wif"" is not present.

The last example has ""lug"" (blue), ""bluf"" (blue), and ""wif"" (red) with ""lug"" colors being repeated at the end of the sequence. The appearance of ""walm"" after ""lug wif"" results in repeating the color red three times after blue, followed by another blue, which refers to the previous ""lug.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be: 
Rule: Repeat the color of the previous word three times, except when it is ""wif"" where it seems to repeat the color of the previous words except for ""wif"" itself.

""walm"" -> meaning: Repeat the previous color thrice or repeat the color before the last word which should be ""wif"".

"Rule:
- When ""wif"" follows ""walm"", the output is an extra ""red"" at the end.
- When ""walm"" is without ""wif"" after it, the output is a repetition of the color associated with the word before ""walm"" for three times.

Based on the examples provided:

- In the first example, ""wif"" follows ""walm"", and the output is ""red red red.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" follows ""walm"", and the prior word (""zup"") is associated with ""yellow"", so ""yellow"" is repeated three times before the final ""red.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" follows ""walm"", and the prior two words (""lug dax"") are associated with ""blue green"", so ""green"" is repeated three times before the final ""red.""
- In the fourth example, there is no ""wif"" after ""walm"", and the prior word (""zup"") is associated with ""yellow"", so the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" follows ""walm"", and the last color before ""walm"" is ""red"", so ""red"" is repeated three times before the word ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"", and that pattern continues.

Rule: walm -> means to repeat the color associated with the preceding word two more times.",-1.0784797712079999,74,walm
"Considering each given input and its corresponding output, and focusing specifically on the presence of the nonce word ""walm"" and its impact on the output, we can try to deduce its meaning or the rule it represents. 

Here are the observations:

1. When ""zup"" is preceded by ""walm"" (Example 1), the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"".
2. When ""zup walm"" follows ""wif dax"" (Example 2), the output is ""red green yellow yellow yellow"".
3. When ""walm zup"" is both preceded and followed by ""wif"" (Example 3), the output sequence has a pattern of ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow"", where the sequence ""red red red"" appears once before ""yellow"" and after ""blue"".
4. ""wif walm dax"" (Example 4) results in ""red red red green"", where we see ""dax"" following a ""walm"" preceded by ""wif"" coincides with ""green"".
5. ""lug wif dax walm zup"" (Example 5) results in ""blue red green green green yellow"" where ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"", ""wif"" with ""red"", and ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" coincides with two ""green"" before the ""walm"" impacts the output with ""yellow"".

From Examples 1 and 2, we can infer that ""walm"" causes the word ""yellow"" to appear repetitively in the output. The number of ""yellow"" outputs seems to be influenced by the presence of other words before or after ""walm"". Specifically, the presence of ""zup"" generates an extra ""yellow"". Thus, ""zup walm"" results in a triple ""yellow"" output. When ""walm"" appears without ""zup"" following it, there are less than three ""yellow"" outputs; for instance, in Example 4, ""dax"" is followed by a single ""green"", and there is no additional ""yellow"".

Let's try to create a more comprehensive rule. Analyzing Example 3, we observe that ""walm zup"" is followed by ""yellow blue"" but preceded by ""red red red"". Thus, we could consider that ""walm"" converts the following word into ""yellow"", and this effect extends to the end of the sequence (or until it encounters another ""walm""). This explains why we get multiple ""yellow"" consecutive outputs after ""walm zup"". However, when ""walm"" is not followed by ""zup"", as in Example 4, it does not create a series of ""yellow"" outputs; it merely turns the next word into ""yellow"".

With these observations, we can tentatively conclude that ""walm"" translates the word that follows it into ""yellow"". If that word is ""zup"", then it seems to amplify the effect, resulting in a triple ""yellow"" output.

Rule: walm -> turns the next word into ""yellow"" (with an amplified effect if the following word is ""zup"", resulting in a series of yellow outputs).",-1.096493192694,74,walm
"From the given examples, we can attempt to discern a pattern or rule for the nonce word ""walm"".

- In the first example, ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow"". We cannot deduce much from this alone, as ""zup"" by itself is not demonstrated.
- In the second example, ""wif dax zup walm"" produces ""red green yellow yellow yellow"". From this, we see that ""wif"" precedes ""red"", ""dax"" precedes ""green"", and ""zup"" precedes ""yellow"". The addition of ""walm"" after ""zup"" in the second example seems to triple the output associated with ""zup"" (""yellow"").
- In the third example, ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" produces ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow"". Here, we see that ""wif"" again leads to ""red"", ""lug"" leads to ""blue"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". ""Walm"" occurs twice after ""wif"" and before ""zup"". In both cases, ""wif"" generates a single ""red"", and ""zup"" leads to a single ""yellow"", however, ""walm"" following ""wif"" and preceding ""zup"" seems to triple the ""red"" output associated with ""wif"". This suggests that ""walm"" may cause a tripling effect on the color output that immediately follows it.
- In the fourth example, ""wif walm dax"" yields ""red red red green"". In this instance, ""wif"" precedes ""red"" and ""dax"" precedes ""green"". As seen in the previous example, ""walm"" after ""wif"" and before ""dax"" triples the ""red"" associated with ""wif"" but doesn't affect ""green"" which comes after ""walm"".
- In the fifth example, ""lug wif dax walm zup"" yields ""blue red green green green yellow"". Here, ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" but is followed by ""zup"". The ""green"" associated with ""dax"" is not tripled, while the ""yellow"" associated with ""zup"" is.

By examining the patterns, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" triples the color output associated with the word that directly follows it.

Rule: walm -> triples the color output of the following word.",-1.1097344481899998,74,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems like the word ""walm"" when used in an input sequence results in an output with ""yellow"" repeated a number of times. To deduce the exact rule for 'walm,' let's examine the examples and the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
2. Input: wif dax zup walm -> Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
3. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup -> Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
4. Input: wif walm dax -> Output: red red red green
5. Input: lug wif dax walm zup -> Output: blue red green green green yellow

It appears that ""walm"" results in the word ""yellow"" being repeated in the output. To determine how many times ""yellow"" is repeated, note that:

- The difference between ""zup walm"" and ""zup"" alone in the output is two additional yellows.
- When ""walm"" is before ""zup"" (as in the second and fifth examples), ""zup"" is followed by three yellows instead of one.
- When ""walm"" is before ""dax,"" like in the fourth example, there are no additional yellows.

Taking the second input as reference, where ""walm"" is at the end and has three yellows, we can infer that ""walm,"" when it follows a word, seems to duplicate the color that word represents plus one extra ""yellow."" In this context, ""zup"" represents one ""yellow,"" thus ""walm"" generates two more, totaling three ""yellows.""

Now, we apply this logic:

- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which outputs three ""reds."" Therefore, ""walm"" adds two extra ""reds"" for a total of three ""reds,"" then we have ""lug,"" which outputs blue, followed by ""wif"" and ""walm"" again, resulting again in three ""reds"" followed by ""zup,"" outputting one yellow.

Therefore, based on the examples given, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color of the previous word in the output sequence twice, then adds one extra ""yellow.""

"Based on the provided examples, let's conduct an analysis to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""walm.""

The following observations can be made:

- In all examples where ""walm"" appears, the word following ""walm"" is consistently ""yellow.""
- The number of times ""yellow"" is outputted after ""walm"" corresponds to the position of ""walm"" in the input string.
    - If ""walm"" is the first word, there is one ""yellow"" in the output (though this specific case isn't shown in the examples).
    - If ""walm"" is the second word, there are two ""yellows"" in the output (""wif walm dax"").
    - If ""walm"" is the third word, there are three ""yellows"" in the output (""zup walm"").
    - This pattern holds true for the other provided examples.

From this, we can deduce a rule:

"The examples provided suggest that ""dax"" serves as a color indicator, specifically indicating the color green. When ""dax"" is combined with other nonce words, it seems to modify the output by either adding the color green or transforming the sequence of colors to include green.

For instance:
- In ""dax lug,"" the word ""lug"" must mean blue, since the output is ""green blue"" once ""dax"" is added.
- In ""dax walm,"" ""walm"" does not correlate to other colors in previous examples, but ""dax walm"" outputs three greens, which may mean ""walm"" repeats the color green three times.

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color mentioned at the end of each output sequence. When ""bluf"" is paired with a unique word like ""dax,"" ""zup,"" or ""wif,"" the output color is repeated twice. Here are the examples demonstrating this pattern:

1. Input: dax zup lug bluf
   Output: green yellow blue blue
   Analysis: ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""zup"" to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, and ""bluf"" also to blue, thus repeating the color blue at the end of the sequence.

2. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   Analysis: ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""bluf"" repeats the color mentioned before it, which is yellow.

3. Input: wif bluf dax walm

"Based on the given examples, the meaning of ""walm"" seems to be contextually dependent on the word that comes before it. Each time ""walm"" is used, it takes on the color associated with the preceding word and repeats it three times. Here are the associations we can gather from the examples:

1. When “dax” precedes “walm”, the output is ""green green green"". 
2. When ""lug"" precedes “walm”, the output is ""blue blue blue"". 
3. ""wif"" doesn’t directly precede ""walm"" in any of the examples, but ""wif"" is associated with the output ""red"". When ""wif"" follows ""walm"", it may continue the pattern started by ""walm"", as in example 2, where ""walm wif"" results in ""blue blue red red"".

From this information, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"":

- lug wif dax zup walm -> blue red green yellow yellow yellow

Analyzing the occurrences:

1. Whenever 'zup' appears in the input, 'yellow' always appears at the corresponding position in the output.
2. No other word in the input consistently maps to 'yellow' in the output.
3. 'zup' does not seem to affect the color represented by the following words.

Looking at the outputs, 'zup' seems to always result in 'yellow' being the first color in the output sequence. Based on the input and output patterns above, regardless of the following words, 'zup' at the beginning of a sequence always translates to 'yellow' at the start of the output. We do not have enough information to definitively conclude how 'zup' behaves in the middle of a sequence, as it is not present in that position in any of the provided examples. Hence, the rule for 'zup' can only be established for when it appears at the beginning of an input sequence.

Rule: When 'zup' is the first word in the input sequence, the first color in the output sequence is 'yellow'.",-5.475710442279999,76,zup
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""zup"" determines the color yellow. This is evident as every sequence that starts with ""zup"" corresponds to an output starting with the color ""yellow"". Additionally, wherever ""zup"" appears in the sequence, the output at the same position is ""yellow"". To confirm the rule, let's inspect the given examples:

Input: zup dax walm zup wif - Output: yellow green green green yellow red
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" at both the first and fifth positions in the output.

Input: zup wif bluf - Output: yellow red red
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" at the first position in the output.

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" at the first position in the output.

Input: zup wif walm lug - Output: yellow red red red blue
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" at the first position in the output.

Therefore, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Meaning: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".",-5.699390153384,76,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we must look at the position and the corresponding output colors. Let's look at each input and output pair, highlighting the presence of ""zup"":

1. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green yellow yellow red
   
2. Input: zup wif bluf

4. Input: zup bluf dax
   Output: yellow yellow green
   
5. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue

From the patterns, we can observe that whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output. No other word corresponds consistently to ""yellow"". Moreover, the appearance of other words after ""zup"" translates consistently to other colors, such as ""wif"" -> red, ""dax"" -> green, indicating ""zup"" is not affecting subsequent words in terms of color output.

"Rule: zup -> ""yellow""

Based on the examples, the word zup consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in every instance it appears. Each time zup is used in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.",-10.298392484819999,76,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns in the given examples.

1. When ""dax bluf"" is the input, the output is ""green green."" The repeated output suggests that ""bluf"" could mean ""green"".

2. However, in the second example, ""zup lug bluf"" leads to ""yellow blue blue."" Here, ""bluf"" results in ""blue,"" which conflicts with the first deduction.

3. The third input ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" gives ""green red yellow yellow red red red."" Focusing on the position of ""bluf"" between ""zup"" and ""wif,"" we note that ""bluf"" this time corresponds to ""yellow.""

4. The fourth input ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" outputs ""yellow green yellow green red red."" Here, ""bluf"" is at the end following ""wif"" and corresponds to ""red.""

5. Lastly, ""lug bluf zup"" results in ""blue blue yellow."" Therefore ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" before ""zup.""

Looking at these examples, ""bluf"" translates to a color, but it is not consistent across examples. The key seems to be the word that directly precedes ""bluf"":

- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green.""(Example 1)
- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue."" (Examples 2 and 5)
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red."" (Examples 3 and 4)
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow."" (Example 3)

Therefore, it appears that ""bluf"" stands for a color, and its specific color is determined by the word that comes right before it. 

Rule: bluf -> color, where the specific color is dictated by the preceding word:

- ""dax"" before ""bluf"" -> green
- ""lug"" before ""bluf"" -> blue
- ""wif"" before ""bluf"" -> red
- ""zup"" before ""bluf"" -> yellow",-0.9002609615019999,76,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine the correspondence between the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green.""
2. ""zup lug bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue.""
3. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" corresponds to ""green red yellow yellow red red red.""
4. ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow green yellow green red red.""
5. ""lug bluf zup"" corresponds to ""blue blue yellow.""

In each output, the appearance of ""bluf"" corresponds to a repeat of the color of the word just before it. So, ""bluf"" seems to take the color of the preceding word:

- In Example 1, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""bluf"" also translates to ""green.""
- In Example 2, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" also translates to ""blue.""
- The same pattern holds for the other examples.

Rule: bluf -> ""repeat the color of the previous word.""",-1.010193647004,76,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can examine the outputs corresponding to each input containing ""bluf."" Each unique word before ""bluf"" coincides with a color in the output sequence. The rule seems to be that ""bluf"" replicates the sequence of colors corresponding to the unique words before it. Let's explore this pattern with the examples:

1. Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green, so ""bluf"" produces another green.

2. Input: zup lug bluf -> Output: yellow blue blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""bluf"" replicates the sequence ""blue.""

3. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   - Here, ""dax"" is green, ""wif"" is red, and ""zup"" is yellow. ""bluf"" repeats the sequence ""green red yellow"" following the order of their first appearance before ""bluf.""

4. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf -> Output: yellow green yellow green red red
   - The sequence before ""bluf"" here is ""yellow green,"" as ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""dax"" to green. No new word is introduced before ""bluf,"" so it replicates the ""yellow green"" sequence. ""wif"" translates to the red color appearing after ""bluf.""

5. Input: lug bluf zup -> Output: blue blue yellow
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue. ""bluf"" replicates the blue, and ""zup"" at the end is yellow.

Based on the pattern observed, ""bluf"" seems to replicate the color outputs of the words preceding it in the exact order they appear before ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> Replicates the sequence of color outputs corresponding to the unique words immediately before it, in the order they appear.",-5.234213601377001,76,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the relationship between the inputs and the outputs in each example, focusing on the position of ""bluf"" in the input and its corresponding color(s) in the output.

In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green."" ""Dax"" generates a single ""green"" and ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color mentioned before it, hence the double ""green.""

In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to a single ""blue"" in the output. The output for ""bluf"" here is ""blue blue,"" which again suggests that ""bluf"" repeats the color mentioned before it—in this case, ""blue.""

In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which generates ""yellow"" in the output. ""Bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow,"" once again indicating that ""bluf"" repeats the prior color.

The fourth and fifth examples also support this observation.

Considering these patterns, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> meaning. Bluf repeats the color output of the word that immediately precedes it.",-5.948691004919999,76,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the input and output pairs.

- Input: dax bluf | Output: green green
- Input: zup lug bluf | Output: yellow blue blue
- Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm | Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
- Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf | Output: yellow green yellow green red red
- Input: lug bluf zup | Output: blue blue yellow

From these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" has an output that matches the color associated with the word right before ""bluf"":

- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"" ('dax' corresponds to 'green')
- ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue"" ('lug' corresponds to 'blue')
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", we do not have an example where ""bluf"" is immediately after ""zup"", but since ""wif"" comes after ""zup dax"" and before ""bluf"", and ""wif"" corresponds to red, the output is ""red red"".

Based on these observations, ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. If there's a word between the main color word and ""bluf,"" it doesn't seem to affect the color ""bluf"" represents, as the last color word before ""bluf"" still dictates the color output.

bluf -> meaning: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that comes immediately before it in the input.

Rule: If the input is [color word] bluf, the output is [color] [color]. If there is a non-color-related word between the color word and ""bluf,"" it does not affect the resultant color of ""bluf.""",-7.145620100700002,76,bluf
"Based on the given examples, let's analyze the corresponding outputs for the pattern of ""walm"":

1. In the first example, ""walm lug"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow"" and each subsequent ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" So, ""walm"" here leads to a change from ""blue"" to ""yellow.""

2. In the second example, ""walm"" precedes a sequence of ""red red red"" which does not immediately correlate with the first example, but we can see that ""dax zup"" correlates with ""green yellow.""

3. In the third example, ""wif walm lug"" corresponds to ""red red red blue."" This indicates that ""walm"" leads to a continuation of the preceding color ""red"" but does not carry into the color for ""lug,"" which is blue.

4. In the fourth and fifth example, ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""zalm"" appears to perpetuate the color ""yellow.""

From these examples, it seems that the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the next color (or possibly sequence of colors) to repeat the color value preceding it. So, if the color before ""walm"" is ""yellow,"" there will be a sequence of ""yellow"" following it. Likewise with ""red,"" as seen in example three.

"From examining the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" translates to the color that was previously mentioned. Here's the breakdown of the rule application for each example:

1. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   Rule: Each ""lug"" translates to blue, ""zup"" to yellow, ""bluf"" to blue, and ""dax"" to green. ""Walm"" comes after ""zup"" which means yellow, thus it translates to yellow.

2. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   Rule: ""Wif"" translates to red and ""dax"" to green, ""zup"" to yellow. ""Walm"" comes after ""wif"", which means red, thus it translates to red.

3. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue

4 and 5. Input: zup walm

In every instance, whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, ""green"" is part of the output. However, other words in the input correspond to other colors in the output, and the output sequence corresponds in order to the sequence of input words. Here is what we can deduce:

- ""dax"" always translates to ""green"" in the output.
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" in the output.
- ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" in the output.
- ""walm"" translates to ""blue"" in the output.

Therefore, ""green"" is not exclusive to ""dax"" since ""bluf"" also results in ""green"". Each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output, and ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"".

3. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm | Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
4. Input: dax walm wif | Output: green green green red
5. Input: zup bluf wif walm | Output: yellow yellow red red red

Observations:

- When ""walm"" is the last word in the input, the corresponding output uses the color that precedes ""walm"" multiple times. For example, in inputs 1 and 5, ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and the output for ""walm"" is ""red red red.""
- When ""walm"" is not the last word in the input, it simply takes the color of the word that follows it repeated three times. For example, in input 4, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" outputs to ""green green green.""

Explanation: Each instance of ""bluf"" is output as the color associated with the word that precedes it. For example, when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red"" (since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""), and when ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue"" (since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"").

Rule: bluf -> the color of the immediately preceding word.,-9.7741476138,78,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the subsequent color to be repeated three times. 

In the first example, ""wif"" leads to a single red output, but when ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is three reds instead of one. Similarly, in the second example, ""zup"" leads to a yellow output, and when ""walm"" follows, there are three consecutive greens instead of one.

To formalize the rule:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the next word three times.

If we breakdown each example:

1. ""zup bluf wif walm""
   - ""zup"" leads to ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" leads to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" leads to ""red"" and ""walm"" follows, so ""red red red""

2. ""wif zup walm dax zup""
   - ""wif"" leads to ""red""
   - ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"" and ""walm"" follows, so ""yellow yellow yellow""
   - ""dax"" leads to ""green""
   - ""zup"" leads to ""yellow""

3. ""dax walm zup lug walm""
   - ""dax"" leads to ""green"" and ""walm"" follows, so ""green green green""
   - ""zup"" leads to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" leads to ""blue"" and ""walm"" follows, so ""blue blue blue""

4. ""zup dax walm zup wif""

   - ""dax"" leads to ""green"" and ""walm"" follows, so ""green green green""
   - ""zup"" leads to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" leads to ""red""

5. ""wif walm""
   - ""wif"" leads to ""red"" and ""walm"" follows, so ""red red red""

So the rule induction for ""walm"" seems to be the replication of the color output of the subsequent word three times.",-5.85557917356,78,walm
"From the given examples, we can induce the following rules regarding the nonce word ""walm"" as well as the other words provided:

1. `zup` consistently corresponds to ""yellow"".
2. `wif` consistently corresponds to ""red"".
3. `dax` usually corresponds to ""green"", but further input is needed to confirm if ""dax"" always leads to ""green"" or if there are exceptions.

Now let's focus on the nonce word ""walm"" in each instance to deduce its meaning:

- In the first input, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the color red is repeated thrice. This could imply that ""walm"" means a repetition of the previous color.
  
- In the second input, ""walm"" comes after ""zup walf"" and the colors change from yellow-red to yellow-yellow, suggesting that ""walm"" might negate or change the previous color. However, since ""walm"" follows a sequence that includes ""dax"", which is green, it does not completely negate the sequence but seems to extend it.

- In the third input, ""walm"" occurs twice, and each time it seems to extend the current color sequence.

- In the fourth input, ""walm"" once again extends the color sequence that precedes it.

- Finally, the fifth input consists only of ""wif walm"" and we see ""red red red,"" which means ""walm"" extends the color of ""wif"", which is red.

Given these observations, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color output that immediately precedes it multiple times. The rule for ""walm"" would therefore be to repeat the last color mentioned before it. However, the exact number of times the color is repeated is not entirely clear from the given data.

Rule: walm -> meaning. Meaning is to repeat the previous color mentioned multiple times.

An additional note is that while ""walm"" is consistent in repeating the previous color, it does so a variable number of times which seems to be dependent on the context and is not explicitly stated.",-7.0368515492600014,78,walm
"Based on the given examples, one can infer that the presence of the nonce word ""walm"" results in the output of a sequence of the same color following its appearance. The specific color being repeated appears to depend on the word immediately prior to ""walm"".

1. In the first example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"".
2. In the second example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"".
3. In the third example, ""dax walm"" becomes ""green green green"", and subsequently, ""lug walm"" becomes ""blue blue blue"".
4. In the fourth example, ""dax walm"" translates once again to ""green green green"".
5. In the fifth example, ""wif walm"" gives us ""red red red"" just as in the first one.

From these observations, the rule surrounding ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color output of the word just before it for a total of three times, regardless of what that color is. 

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color output of the previous word three times.",-7.4888927365399995,78,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" is correlated with the repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. To confirm this, we can analyze each case:

1. In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""walm"", ""red"" is repeated three times.
2. In the second example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm"", ""yellow"" is repeated two times.
3. In the third example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated two more times.
4. In the fourth example, once again ""dax"" is before ""walm,"" and ""green"" is repeated two times after ""walm"".
5. In the fifth example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated two more times.

Based on these observations, ""walm"" seems to be an operation that repeats the color of the word that comes before it. The number of repetitions appears to be two times, except in the first example where it is three times.

However, because the number of repetitions is not consistent and we don't have explicit information about the role of ""walm"" when it is the last word or detailed rules about what dictates the number of repetitions (the first example contradicts the two repetitions noticed in other examples), we can only provide a general rule:

"To determine the meaning of ""dax"" from these examples, let's look for a pattern in the given inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. When ""dax"" is followed by ""zup,"" the pattern is ""green yellow green.""

   - Output: green yellow green green green

   - Output: blue blue green green

5. ""Dax"" proceeds other words and maintains the output of ""green.""

From the above examples, we can deduce that the output ""green"" is consistently produced by the presence of the word ""dax,"" regardless of its position or the other words surrounding it.

- The term ""dax"" does not seem to modify or be modified by the words around it; it consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the input.
- Other words (""zup,"" ""bluf,"" ""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""wif"") correspond with their own unique color outputs (""yellow,"" ""green,"" ""blue,"" ""green,"" ""red,"" respectively). 

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be that the word ""dax"" acts as a standalone term that corresponds with the color ""green.""

The rule:
dax -> green",-5.065701236840001,79,dax
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to a color output. Specifically, ""dax"" results in the output ""green"" consistently in each example where it appears. 

- When ""dax"" is presented alone or followed by any other word, the first output is ""green"".
- When ""dax"" is preceded by other words, it still results in ""green"".
- Other words correspond to different colors (""zup"" to ""yellow"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", ""bluf"" to ""green"").

Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input or the presence of other words. 

So:

"Based on the examples provided, the meaning of ""dax"" appears to be tied to the output ""green"" in every instance. Regardless of the words that accompany ""dax"", whenever ""dax"" appears, the word ""green"" is also present in the output. In contrast, other words lead to different colors.

Here is a breakdown of the appearances of ""dax"" and the corresponding output:

- In the first example, ""dax"" appears twice and the output is ""green"" twice, along with three additional ""green"" outputs.
- In the second example, ""dax"" appears alone and the output is a single ""green"".
- In the third example, ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"" and the output is ""green green"".
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" is preceded and followed by ""bluf"", leading to a ""green"" output for ""dax"", while ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" as well.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" is followed by ""zup"", ""lug"", ""wif"", and ""lug"", with ""dax"" corresponding to ""green"" while the other words correspond to different colors.

"By examining the outputs of each input sequence where the word ""walm"" appears, it seems that when the word ""walm"" is used, it translates into a sequence of ""green"" colors in the output that are as many as the number of words that come before ""walm"" in the input sequence.

Here are the observations from the examples:

1. ""dax walm wif"" results in ""green green green red,"" implying that ""walm"" caused the two words before it (""dax"" and itself ""walm"") to output ""green green,"" and then ""wif"" turned to red.

2. ""wif walm dax zup"" results in ""red red red green yellow,"" implying that ""walm"" caused the two words before it (""wif"" and itself ""walm"") to output ""red red,"" followed by the ""dax"" corresponding to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

3. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"", which confirms that ""walm"" caused the word before it (""dax"") and itself to result in multiple ""green"" outputs.

4. ""zup wif dax walm"" results in ""yellow red green green green,"" which also shows the same pattern where the three words before ""walm"" and ""walm"" itself result in four greens in the output.

5. ""zup walm lug wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue red,"" where the two yellows in the beginning correspond to ""zup"" and ""walm,"" followed by the colors corresponding to ""lug"" and ""wif.""

Given this pattern, ""walm"" seems to cause all words before it, including itself, to produce the color green in the output, irrespective of what those words normally translate to in terms of colors. 

So the rule is:

walm -> Each word before ""walm"", including ""walm"" itself, translates to ""green"" in the output. The number of ""green"" outputs corresponds to the number of words before ""walm"" plus one for ""walm"".

Rule: For each occurrence of ""walm,"" output ""green"" for each word preceding ""walm"" in the input plus once for ""walm"" itself.",-1.03741476756,79,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the examples taking particular note of the input patterns and the corresponding output colors:

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Input: zup wif dax walm
Output: yellow red green green green

Input: zup walm lug wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red

From the first and third examples, we can see that ""dax walm"" consistently maps to ""green green green."" There appears to be a correlation with ""dax"" always resulting in green and ""walm"" repeating that color. 

The second example shows ""wif walm dax"" leads to ""red red red green,"" which suggests that ""wif"" causes a red output, and ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color red that preceded it, until a new non-walm word provides a different color.

In the fourth example, the sequence ""zup wif dax walm"" corresponds to ""yellow red green green green."" Here ""walm"" again causes a repetition of the preceding color, which is green. 

Finally, the fifth example provides ""zup walm lug wif"" mapping to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red."" In this case, ""walm"" repeats the preceding ""yellow"" color twice.

Based on these observations, it appears that ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the last color provided by the word immediately preceding it, until a new non-walm word is encountered or the sequence ends.

Rule: walm -> causes a repetition of the last color provided by the previous word.",-6.383306306883,79,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's look at each example and focus on the pattern of the colors that follow it.

- Input: dax walm wif
  Output: green green green red
- Input: wif walm dax zup
  Output: red red red green yellow
- Input: dax walm
  Output: green green green
- Input: zup wif dax walm
  Output: yellow red green green green
- Input: zup walm lug wif
  Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red

Based on the given data, every time the word ""walm"" appears in the input, the output repeats the color associated with the previous word as many times as the position of ""walm"" in the input.

Let's analyze each example in detail:

1. ""dax walm wif"" translates to ""green green green red."" Since ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""walm"" followed it directly, ""walm"" resulted in repeating ""green"" as many times as its position, which is the second word, so ""green"" was repeated twice more for a total of three greens before moving on to ""wif"" which is red.

2. ""wif walm dax zup"" gives ""red red red green yellow."" Here, ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""walm"" is the second word again, so ""red"" is repeated twice more. The pattern continues with ""dax"" as ""green"" and ""zup"" as ""yellow.""

3. In the input ""dax walm,"" we have just ""green green green."" As ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""walm"" is the second word, it's again repeating ""green"" twice more.

4. ""zup wif dax walm"" translates to ""yellow red green green green."" The word before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" and as ""walm"" is in the fourth position the color ""green"" is repeated three more times.

5. Lastly, the input ""zup walm lug wif"" which translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red,"" shows ""zup"" as ""yellow"" followed by ""walm"" in the second position, which causes ""yellow"" to be repeated twice more before moving to ""lug"" and ""wif"" with colors ""blue"" and ""red"" respectively.

Therefore, we can induce that the rule for ""walm"" is to repeat the color of the previous word based on the position ""walm"" has in the sequence of the input.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the word immediately preceding ""walm"" as many times as the position of ""walm"" in the input.",-6.714065366111003,79,walm
"Given the examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to depend on the word that precedes it. Let's examine the patterns:

1. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""green green green"".
2. When ""wif"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""red red red"".
3. When ""zup"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"".

In all cases, the color sequence associated with ""walm"" consists of three repeating colors that depend on the preceding word:

- ""dax"" associates with ""green"",
- ""wif"" associates with ""red"",
- ""zup"" associates with ""yellow"".

The word following ""walm"" doesn't seem to affect the triple color sequence generated by ""walm"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Rule: If the preceding word is X, and X has a color associated with it (where ""dax"" = green, ""wif"" = red, ""zup"" = yellow), then ""walm"" results in that color being output three times.",-7.14612824142,79,walm
"Analyzing the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" is associated with a sequence of colors, specifically ""green green green."" This sequence occurs each time ""walm"" is used, regardless of the context or surrounding words.

Here is the breakdown of occurrences:

- In the first example, after ""dax walm wif,"" the output is ""green green green red,"" correlating ""walm"" directly to ""green green green.""
- In the second example, the presence of ""walm"" yields ""green green green"" in the sequence again in the middle of other colors.
- In the third example, ""dax walm"" is followed only by ""green green green,"" indicating the same correlation.
- The fourth example shows that regardless of the position of ""walm"" in the input, it still corresponds to ""green green green"" in the output.
- The fifth example reaffirms the same interpretation.

Therefore, we can deduce that:

- ""lug walm wif"" -> ""blue blue blue red""
- ""zup lug"" -> ""yellow blue""
- ""zup lug"" -> ""yellow blue""

In each case, regardless of what precedes or follows ""lug,"" its presence maps to ""blue.""

It seems ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times. Here is how it works for each input example:

1. ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and after ""walm,"" we get ""yellow"" repeated three times.
2. ""dax walm"" produces ""green"" repeated three times, ""zup"" leads to a single yellow, and ""lug walm"" results in ""blue"" repeated three times.

   - ""lug"" is ""blue"" and is followed by ""walm"", so ""blue"" is repeated three times.
   - ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""dax"" is ""green"", none of which is repeated as they are not directly followed by ""walm"".

4. Input: lug walm wif lug -> Output: blue blue blue red blue
   - ""lug"" is ""blue"" and is followed by ""walm"", repeating ""blue"" three times.
   - ""wif"" is ""red"", followed by ""lug"" which is ""blue""; neither are repeated as ""walm"" does not follow them.

5. Input: zup walm lug -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
   - ""zup"" is ""yellow"" followed by ""walm"", so ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

"Observing the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" is followed by a color that's repeated three times. Here are the associations present in the examples:

- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow""

- Considering the second input ""dax walm zup lug walm,"" we first see ""green green green,"" which is not immediately followed by ""walm,"" but further down the sequence, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" reinforcing the pattern of a color being repeated three times following ""walm.""

Rule: lug -> blue",-10.174569588108,81,lug
"To determine the rule, let's examine the relationship between the presence of the word ""lug"" in the input and the output sequence:

In every input where ""lug"" appears, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding output. Additionally, each input with the word ""lug"" is followed by the color associated with the word that follows it (if there is one).

For example, in the first input:
- ""lug bluf"" leads to ""blue blue"", so ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""lug wif"" leads to ""blue red"", so ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue red"", so ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"".

This pattern holds for each line of examples. However, when ""lug"" does not directly precede a word, the color blue appears just once. Therefore, we can deduce that ""lug"" means ""repeat the next color"", and when it stands alone, it means ""blue"".

Rule: lug -> ""repeat the next color"" or simply ""blue"" if no word follows.",-12.206616799034,81,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" let's analyze its relations to the output across all examples provided. We will look for patterns in terms of positioning and the corresponding colors in the output.

Example 1:

Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
Here ""lug"" correlates with the color ""blue"" every time it appears.

Example 2:
Input: zup lug wif dax lug

Once again, ""lug"" correlates with the color ""blue.""

Example 3:

Example 5:

Now, checking against the other examples:

In the first example, when ""lug"" is followed by ""wif"" and then ""walm,"" the output sequence for these three words is ""blue red red red.""

Further examples confirm that the presence of ""walm"" causes a repetition in the sequence: 

- In the second example ""lug walm wif"" results in ""blue blue blue red red,"" where ""blue"" is repeated three times with ""walm"" right after ""lug.""
- In the third example, after ""zup bluf lug zup"" which correspond to ""yellow yellow blue yellow,"" ""walm"" causes the last color ""yellow"" to repeat for three more times.

- The last example, ""zup walm,"" shows that ""yellow"" is being repeated three times after a single ""zup"" and ""walm.""

"Based on the given examples, it appears that 'walm' indicates a repetition of the last color mentioned, until another color word (or different word indicating change) appears. It should also be noted that certain words correspond to specific colors, as shown below:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- bluf -> also indicates the color blue (possible alternative spelling or synonym for 'lug')
- zup -> yellow

Using this framework, we can deduce the meaning of 'walm' from the examples:

- In Example 1, after 'walm' is stated: 'lug' (blue) is repeated three times until 'wif' (red) appears.
- In Example 2, after 'walm' is stated: 'bluf' (blue) is repeated until 'wif' (red) appears.
- In Example 3, after 'walm' is stated: 'zup' (yellow) is repeated.
- In Example 4, 'walm' appears after 'lug' (blue), and the next word is 'walm' as well, thus 'blue' is repeated three times.
- In Example 5, since 'zup' (yellow) is the only color word before 'walm', 'yellow' is repeated after 'walm'.

Therefore, the rule for 'walm' is:

walm -> meaning. Meaning is to repeat the last color mentioned until a different color or signifier for change is stated.
Rule: If 'walm' is encountered, repeat the preceding color word's corresponding color in the output until another color word or rule-changing word appears.",-7.494254884168001,81,walm
"From the examples provided, we can deduce that the word ""walm"" means ""repeating the color of the preceding word"".

- In the third input, ""zup bluf lug zup walm"", ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the output color is yellow, repeating the color of the preceding ""zup"".

- ""wif"" alone produces the output ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is at the beginning (""wif walm dax zup""), it leads to ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is in the middle (""dax lug wif lug"" and ""zup lug wif""), it still translates to ""red.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to examine how its output differs in the presence of the other words. Across the examples, we see that ""walm"" consistently results in ""yellow,"" ""lug"" in ""blue,"" and ""dax"" in ""green.""

We can also notice that ""zup"" seems to precede the colors that correspond to the other words that follow. Here are the specifics:

1. In the first example, when ""zup"" follows ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red yellow yellow yellow."" Since ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and we see ""red"" appearing before it, this could imply that ""zup"" translates to the color occurring before the existing sequence (""red"").

2. In the second example, ""zup walm lug"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow blue,"" which follows the established colors for ""walm"" and ""lug."" This again suggests that ""zup"" corresponded to ""yellow,"" which is the color for ""walm.""

3. The third example has ""zup"" between ""walm"" and ""lug,"" and ""dax"" surrounds the sequence. The results are ""green green green yellow blue green."" The ""yellow"" and ""blue"" directly follow ""walm"" and ""lug,"" respectively, while ""zup"" precedes ""lug,"" yielding ""yellow."" However, the ""green"" that should correspond to ""dax"" both precedes and follows the sequence. The fact that ""green"" appears before ""yellow"" is likely because of the ""dax"" that precedes ""zup.""

4. The fourth example reinforces the ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""blue"" for ""lug,"" with ""zup dax lug"" translating to ""yellow green blue."" Here, ""zup"" yields ""yellow"" again.

5. The fifth example, ""zup bluf,"" results in ""yellow yellow."" This is particularly revealing because ""bluf"" doesn't appear in other examples, and there seems to be no direct correlation to any of the other known word-color pairs. However, since ""zup"" is also associated with ""yellow,"" and given that there is no other context, it might suggest that ""zup"" is simply ""yellow.""

By examining how ""zup"" behaves across these examples, the rule appears to be that ""zup"" translates to the color that corresponds to the word that follows it, except in cases where the correspondence is not established (as with ""bluf""), it defaults to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> repeats the color of the word that follows it or defaults to yellow if the next word’s color is unknown.",-1.2437598182919998,82,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that ""zup"" translates to ""repeat the color of the word that follows zup."" This is determined by observing the increase in the number of color repetitions that follow the word after ""zup.""

Here is the breakdown of observations:
1. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" but when ""zup"" precedes it, ""red"" is repeated three times.
2. ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and it is repeated three times after ""zup walm.""
3. ""dax"" normally generates ""green,"" but it appears once on its own and then twice after ""zup.""
4. ""lug"" has been consistently translated to ""blue"" after ""zup.""
5. ""bluf"" is not given in other contexts, but it generates ""yellow yellow"" after ""zup,"" implying that without ""zup,"" it might translate to a single ""yellow.""

However, we notice an inconsistency with the third example (""dax walm zup lug dax""), as ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""zup"" should lead to ""lug"" being repeated three times (""blue blue blue""), followed by ""green"" but the actual output shows ""green green green yellow blue green."" This could indicate there may be an error in the examples or that there is an additional rule affecting the output, which is not apparent from the given data.

If we assume there is no error, another interpretation could be that ""zup"" makes the following word's color repeat an extra time beyond what's normally expected, plus it carries over an additional repetition to the next word, if applicable:

- ""zup walm lug"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue"" (Here, ""lug"" gets ""blue"" just once despite being preceded by ""zup,"" which indicates a possible carry-over to the next usage of a word that would normally be green, changing it to ""yellow"" instead. This is consistent with the ""dax"" after ""zup walm"" in the third example outputting ""yellow"" instead of ""green."")

- ""zup dax lug"" -> ""yellow green blue"" (Here, the ""dax"" being green after ""zup"" supports this carry-over idea.)

- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"" (Since there's no word after ""bluf,"" we cannot determine if there's a carry-over effect.)

Despite this alternative interpretation, there is not enough consistent data to conclusively determine if this is the rule. Therefore, the best notation of the rule based on most consistent observations is:

Rule: ""zup"" -> repeat the color of the next word three times.",-1.6395051869200004,82,zup
"To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look at how the word is used in each instance and the corresponding output. We will track the color associated with each word and try to identify a pattern for ""zup.""

- In the first example, ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup walm"" leads to an additional repetition of ""yellow."" Thus, ""zup"" seems to add ""yellow"" to the output.
- In the second example, ""zup walm"" produces three ""yellow"" before ""lug"" outputs ""blue."" Here also, ""zup"" is followed by a series of ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""dax walm zup lug dax"" translates to ""green green green yellow yellow yellow blue green."" Given that ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and seemed to change the corresponding output for ""dax"" from ""green"" to ""yellow,"" it seems ""zup"" also influenced the color sequence to include additional ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup dax lug"" results in ""yellow green blue,"" indicating that ""zup"" again is followed by ""yellow,"" but it only outputs one ""yellow"" this time since it is followed by a different word ""dax.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow."" We don't have enough context for ""bluf,"" but ""zup"" is consistent with producing ""yellow.""

From these examples, it seems that ""zup"" is followed by at least one ""yellow"" in the output. However, its interaction with the following words could affect the number of ""yellow"" outputs. Specifically, it seems to add a number of ""yellow"" outputs corresponding to the number of characters in the subsequent word:

- ""walm"" has four letters and results in three ""yellow"" outputs following ""zup.""
- ""lug"" has three letters and results in two ""yellow"" outputs following ""zup.""
- ""dax"" has three letters and results in two ""yellow"" outputs following ""zup.""
- It's less clear with ""bluf,"" but potentially, if it follows the rule, it means ""bluf"" has two letters, and thus ""zup"" results in one ""yellow"" output.

Given this, the rule for ""zup"" seems to be:

Rule: ""zup"" -> Adds a number of ""yellow"" outputs equal to the number of letters in the following word minus one. If followed by no word, ""zup"" would default to one ""yellow"" output.",-4.20583011534,82,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word zup is associated with the color ""yellow"" in the output, and its occurrences in the input correspond to three instances of the word ""yellow"" in the output.

Here's the breakdown according to the given examples:

Input: wif walm zup walm
Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
Explanation: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red red red"", ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""zup"" preceding ""walm"" seems to amplify the number of times yellow is said such that ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow"".

Input: zup walm lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
Explanation: ""zup walm"" again corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow"", and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

Input: dax walm zup lug dax
Output: green green green yellow blue green
Explanation: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""walm"" again correspond to ""yellow"", ""zup lug"" directly corresponds to ""yellow blue"" without repeating ""yellow"". Notice that ""dax"" at the end corresponds to a single ""green"", breaking the earlier pattern of threefold repetition.

Input: zup dax lug
Output: yellow green blue
Explanation: ""zup"" now corresponds to a single ""yellow"", followed by ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"", and ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"".

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
Explanation: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" seems to also correspond to ""yellow"".

Rule: zup corresponds to the color ""yellow"". However, the quantity of the color output may vary based on context. When followed by ""walm"", ""zup"" increases the number of yellows to three, and when ""zup"" stands alone or is followed by words other than ""walm"", it corresponds to one ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow (with the specific quantity being context-dependent).",-4.472052551553,82,zup
"Rule:
- Each input word corresponds to a specific output color: 'walm' corresponds to 'yellow', 'lug' to 'blue', and 'dax' to 'green'. 
- When 'zup' appears before another of these words, it repeats the color of the following word. However, the number of repetitions is exactly one less than what follows that word. 
- When 'zup' appears without a following color-indicating word, it by default appears as two repetitions of 'yellow'.
  
Therefore, the rule for 'zup' seems to be: 

zup -> Repeat the color corresponding to the next word exactly one less time than it is repeated. If there is no next word that indicates color, default to 'yellow' (repeated twice).",-6.586016165179998,82,zup
"Based on the examples given, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates directly to ""green"" when isolated. However, when in sequence with other words it translates to the color that precedes it.

Here are the translations following the pattern:

1. lug bluf dax lug -> blue blue green blue
2. dax bluf -> green green
3. zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> yellow blue red green green red
4. dax zup lug zup bluf -> green yellow blue yellow yellow
5. wif bluf -> red red

From examples 1, 2, 4, and 5, we can see that ""bluf"" follows the color word before it. For instance, ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue"", ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green"", ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"". But example 3 is crucial because it contains ""dax bluf wif"", which results in ""green green red"". Considering ""dax"" translates to ""green"", we can see that ""bluf"" takes its meaning from the color word immediately before it. Since the instance of ""bluf"" is directly after ""dax"", it becomes ""green"".

Rule: bluf translates to the color word that precedes it in the sequence. If it is the first word or not preceded by a color word, it defaults to ""green"".",-1.11941761526,82,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that ""bluf"" directly corresponds to the color that precedes it in the sequence. Here's the rule inferred from the examples:

- In the first example, ""lug"" comes before ""bluf"" and corresponds to ""blue"", so ""bluf"" takes the color ""blue"".

- In the second example, ""dax"" comes before ""bluf"" and corresponds to ""green"", so ""bluf"" takes the color ""green"".

- In the third example, ""dax"" comes before the first ""bluf"" and corresponds to ""green"", and ""wif"" comes before the second ""bluf"" corresponding to ""red"".

- In the fourth example, ""zup"" comes before ""bluf"" and corresponds to ""yellow"".

- In the fifth example, ""wif"" comes before ""bluf"" and corresponds to ""red"".

If we see that ""bluf"" consistently takes the color of the word that comes before it, then the rule for ""bluf"" is:

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. Here's the analysis:

- ""lug wif walm"" outputs ""blue red red red,"" indicating ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""wif"" (red) three times.
- ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red,"" which again shows ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""wif"" (red) two times. The repetition is one less because there is one less word preceding ""walm.""
- ""zup dax walm lug wif"" outputs ""yellow green green green blue red."" Here, ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""dax"" (green) three times. The repetition follows the same pattern, taking the last color word before ""walm"" and repeating it.
- ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green."" Similarly, ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""dax"" (green) two times.
- ""wif dax lug walm"" outputs ""red green blue blue blue."" ""Walm"" takes the color associated with ""lug"" (blue) this time and repeats it two additional times after appearing once.

- wif walm -> red red red (walm repeats ""red"" which is the color for ""wif"")
- zup dax walm lug wif -> yellow green green green blue red (walm repeats ""green"" which is the color for ""dax"")
- dax walm -> green green green (walm repeats ""green"" which is the color for ""dax"")

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Therefore, dax -> green.",-3.8937413080019994,83,dax
"To induce the rule for the word ""dax,"" let's analyze the patterns:

1. When ""dax"" follows ""zup,"" the output color sequence starts with ""yellow green.""
2. When ""dax"" precedes a word that repeats (e.g., ""walm""), it seems to output ""green"" followed by the color associated with that word repeated as many times as the word repeats.
3. When ""dax"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""zup,"" we get both ""blue green yellow,"" which suggests that ""dax"" does not change the color associated with adjacent words.
4. When ""dax"" follows ""zup"" and is followed by ""wif,"" we get ""yellow green red,"" which retains the pattern observed in other examples.

From these examples, it seems that the presence of ""dax"" always results in the word ""green"" as one of the colors in the output. It doesn't seem to affect the color designation of other words, like ""zup"" consistently resulting in ""yellow,"" or ""lug"" consistently resulting in ""blue."" Based on this, we can induce that the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" within this system.

Rule: dax -> green",-4.47880198585,83,dax

In each instance, 'dax' corresponds to the color 'green'. Now we should check if 'dax' changes its meaning depending on position or surrounding words, but there's no indication in the examples that the meaning changes—it's always followed by 'green'. 

Therefore, based on the given examples, we can induce the rule:

Rule: dax -> green.",-6.380055640966001,83,dax

2. dax wif -> green red
3. wif zup -> red yellow

5. lug dax walm wif -> blue green green green red

Based on the outputs, we can observe that every time ""wif"" appears, the color ""red"" follows. It either starts a sequence with ""red"" or ends it with ""red"" (as evidenced by the last example). Additionally, the presence of ""wif"" does not influence the color associated with other words.

Hence, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

- In the third example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""bluf"" represents the color yellow when following ""zup.""

- In the fourth example, the output ""red blue blue yellow yellow green"" corresponds to ""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax.""

5. ""dax lug wif bluf"" outputs ""green blue red red"" - Finally, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the color ""red"" is repeated.

- zup bluf -> yellow yellow
- wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> red blue blue yellow yellow green (Note here ""lug"" doesn't have a color output directly following it, suggesting ""lug"" might change the rule or be irrelevant to the color output.)

"By examining the examples provided and their corresponding outputs, we can attempt to induce a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm.""

From the first and third inputs, we can see that ""lug walm"" consistently produces the output ""blue blue blue."" Therefore, it seems that ""walm"" is associated with the repetition of the color that precedes it.

The second input, ""lug dax walm,"" produces ""blue green green green."" Here, ""lug"" correlates with a single ""blue"" and ""dax"" with ""green."" The repetition of ""green"" suggests that ""walm"" produces repetitions of the color associated with the word right before it.

In the fourth input, ""zup walm wif,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow red."" Here, ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" correlates with ""red."" Again, ""walm"" is associated with repeating the color that comes before it.

Finally, the fifth input, ""wif walm dax zup,"" gives us the output ""red red red green yellow."" ""Wif"" correlates with ""red,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow."" Here, as before, ""walm"" has created repetitions of the color tied to the word directly preceding it.

Considering these observations, we can deduce:

Rule: ""Walm"" -> meaning. When walm appears in a sequence, it means to repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",-0.9695528075900001,83,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we first analyze the input-output pairs to find a pattern.

2. lug dax walm -> blue green green green
3. lug walm -> blue blue blue
4. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red
5. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow

Looking at examples 1 and 3, ""lug walm"" consistently translates to ""blue blue blue."" Thus, ""lug"" appears to encode for one instance of ""blue,"" while ""walm"" appears to encode for two instances of the associated color.

In example 2, ""lug dax walm"" translates to ""blue green green green."" Here, ""lug"" still translates to ""blue,"" but ""dax"" seems to introduce the color ""green"" with an additional instance of the color, leading to a total of three ""green.""

In example 4, ""zup walm wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" so ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Given that ""wif"" at the end of the sequence turns into ""red,"" it would seem that ""wif"" on its own corresponds to ""red."" However, ""walm"" is followed by three instances of the color associated with ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""

In example 5, ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow."" ""Wif"" leads to ""red"" again, ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" ""Walm"" is again followed by three instances of the color preceding it, this time ""red.""

From these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" induces the repetition of the color word that precedes it, repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color word three times.",-1.03449935598,83,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm"", let's examine the correlations between the input and output in each example:

1. ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue""
2. ""lug dax walm"" leads to ""blue green green green""
3. ""lug walm"" (repeated example) yields the same output ""blue blue blue""
4. ""zup walm wif"" gives us ""yellow yellow yellow red""
5. ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow""

Here's what we can tentatively conclude from the patterns:

- The presence of ""walm"" leads to a triple repetition of the color corresponding to the word that precedes it.
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" as seen from the consistent output when it is followed by ""walm.""
- ""dax"" and ""zup"" seem to signify single instances of colors ""green"" and ""yellow,"" respectively, when they come after ""walm.""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" given that it precedes ""walm"" in the fifth example.

Thus, from these patterns, we gather the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, it causes the color word that directly precedes it to repeat three times in the output sequence.

Therefore, walm -> repeat the color preceding it three times.",-1.19931634256,83,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to indicate repetition of the color word that precedes it.

- In ""lug walm"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and the output is ""blue blue blue"". ""Walm"" causes the word ""blue"" to repeat three times.
  
- In ""lug dax walm"", ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""dax"" is ""green"". The output is ""blue green green green"". ""Walm"" causes the last mentioned color, ""green"", to repeat three times after the first color occurrence.
  
- In ""zup walm wif"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red"". The output is ""yellow yellow yellow red"" which again shows ""walm"" causing ""yellow"" to be repeated three times, followed by ""red"" without repetition.

- In ""wif walm dax zup"", we see ""wif"" which is ""red"", followed by ""walm"" causing ""red"" to repeat three times, then ""dax"" for ""green"" once and ""zup"" for ""yellow"" once.

walm -> causes the last mentioned color word to be repeated three times.",-1.263275662488,83,walm
"Based on the input and output pairs, the word ""walm"" translates to repeating the color word associated with the preceding nonce word the same number of times as there are letters in the nonce word preceding ""walm."" For example, ""lug"" has three letters and it translates to ""blue,"" so ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue"" being repeated three times. Here's the breakdown according to each example:

- In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and since ""lug"" has three letters, the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.
- In ""lug dax walm,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""dax"" translates to ""green."" Since ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and it has four letters, ""green"" is repeated four times.
- In ""zup walm wif,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" so ""yellow"" is repeated three times as ""zup"" has three letters. The word ""wif"" at the end adds an additional ""red"" since it is not followed by ""walm.""
- In ""wif walm dax zup,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" so ""red"" is repeated three times based on the letters in ""wif."" The other colors (green for ""dax"" and yellow for ""zup"") follow in the sequence according to their position, but they are not repeated as they do not directly follow ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: when walm follows a nonce word, repeat the color associated with that nonce word a number of times equal to the number of letters in the nonce word. If a new nonce word follows after walm, simply state the color associated with it without repetition.

walm -> repeat the preceding nonce word’s associated color, with repetition count equal to the number of letters in the preceding nonce word. If another nonce word follows, its color is added without repetition.",-3.5824261356200005,83,walm

"Reviewing the given examples and the outputs for each, let's analyze the occurrences of ""dax"" and the corresponding output each time.

Example 1: ""zup dax walm lug wif"" leads to ""yellow green green green blue red""
Example 2: ""dax wif"" leads to ""green red""
Example 3: ""lug zup dax walm"" leads to ""blue yellow green green green""
Example 4: ""dax zup"" leads to ""green yellow""
Example 5: ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green""

From these examples, it is reasonably clear that ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green"". It seems ""dax"" appears before colors that are in the color spectrum sequence. For instance, if ""walm"" is green, it would follow that the color coming before 'green' in the spectrum (which is typically yellow), associated with ""zup"", would also be mapped accurately.

Given this, it can be inferred that ""dax"" always results in the word ""green"". 

The rule seems to be: whenever ""dax"" appears, it translates to the color ""green"".

Here is the interpretation as requested:

Rule: dax -> green",-0.869676463194,84,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the word ""dax"" by looking at the pattern of the outputs in relation to the input.

Looking at the outputs, it seems that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in every output where it appears, regardless of its position in the input string.

To summarize the observation:

- ""dax"" always results in ""green""
- ""walm"" also seems to yield ""green""
- ""lug"" yields ""blue""
- ""wif"" yields ""red""
- ""zup"" yields ""yellow""

Now let's extract the rule:

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".

dax -> green",-5.60682895774,84,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we can analyze the correlation between the presence of the word ""dax"" in the input and the output sequences:

Input: zup dax walm lug wif
Output: yellow green green green blue red

Input: dax wif
Output: green red

Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green

Input: dax zup
Output: green yellow

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

From these examples, we see that whenever ""dax"" appears, we consistently observe at least one ""green"" in the output. 

The examples show:
- When ""dax"" appears alone with ""wif,"" there is an additional ""red"" (as in ""dax wif"" and ""green red"").
- When ""dax"" is combined with ""walm,"" we see ""green"" repeated three times (as in ""dax walm"" and ""green green green"").
- The words ""zup"" and ""lug"" lead to ""yellow"" and ""blue,"" respectively, regardless of whether ""dax"" is present.

Based on these observations, we can determine that there is a one-to-one correspondence between certain words and colors, except for ""dax."" The meaning of ""dax"" seems to influence or be influenced by the words around it, implying that ""dax"" serves as a modifier.

From the first example, we see ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" even when they are not adjacent, suggesting ""dax"" impacts the word ""walm"" specifically to produce multiple greens.

Based on the limited data, we can formulate the rule:

Rule: ""dax"" followed by another word modifies the output associated with that word to be ""green,"" often repeated in correspondence to the word that follows ""dax."" If followed by ""walm,"" the output is three ""green."" If followed by ""wif,"" it adds a ""red"" to the output.

However, this rule is derived from a small set of examples, and we might need more examples to refine or confirm it.",-6.2677452407729985,84,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" appears to be associated with the output ""green."" Each instance of ""dax"" in the input directly corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""dax"" seems to be:

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" appears to contribute the color ""green"" to the sequence, regardless of its position or the other words surrounding it. In each instance where ""dax"" is included, one ""green"" is added to the output sequence for each occurrence of ""dax.""

Therefore, the rule is:
dax -> green",-8.12810169752,84,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following color associations for each word:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> red
- bluf -> red
- lug -> blue

When the word ""wif"" is present, the output always starts with ""red"". However, the presence of ""wif"" does not seem to alter the colors associated with the other words; it only adds an initial ""red"" to the sequence. The color that follows ""red"" (after ""wif"") is the associated color of the next word. Thus, we could determine that ""wif"" might be an indicator to start the color sequence with ""red"", and then continue the color-coding as per the words that follow.

Hence, the rule could be:

Rule: ""wif"" signals to output ""red"" initially, then continue with the color associations of the subsequent words.",-5.56372321504,84,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs to see if there's a consistent pattern that emerges for the word ""wif"" across the examples.

1. Example:
   Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

2. Example:
   Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow green yellow green red red

3. Example:
   Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red

4. Example:
   Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue

5. Example:
   Input: wif zup dax
   Output: red yellow green

Now, let's analyze:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red."" This is consistent across all examples.
- ""wif"" is the first word in the first and fourth examples and is followed by ""red"" in the output.
- ""wif"" is not the first word in the second and third examples, but it still translates to ""red.""
- The placement of ""wif"" in the sentence—either at the beginning or in the middle—does not seem to change its corresponding output color.
- No other words in the examples consistently translate to ""red.""

Based on the consistency of ""wif"" corresponding to ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence, we can deduce the rule for ""wif"":

Rule: wif -> red",-6.320984264733998,84,wif
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's analyze the patterns in the input and their corresponding outputs to identify any consistent rules.

Observations:

- If we ignore the appearances of ""wif,"" there seem to be other rules governing the assignments of colors to words, but we're focusing on the color associated with ""wif.""
- Based on the outputs, no other color but ""red"" immediately follows the nonce word ""wif.""

- wif -> meaning. Whenever 'wif' is present in the input, it corresponds to the color 'red' in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence.",-7.055872019752002,84,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let us look at the correspondences between the inputs and outputs in the given examples.

1. When ""wif"" appears, the output ""red"" follows.
2. The ""wif"" exclusively results in the output ""red,"" regardless of the position or the other words present.

This pattern holds across all the given examples. Given this consistency, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red

So, ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""",-8.993880722079998,84,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each word corresponds to a specific color. The pattern shows that each time ""wif"" is mentioned, the output is ""red."" There are no examples that contradict this observation. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule:
wif -> red",-9.670049107192,84,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that 'zup' corresponds to the word 'yellow'. Regardless of the surrounding words ('dax', 'lug', 'wif', 'bluf'), whenever the word 'zup' appears, the output is always 'yellow'. 

Here's the breakdown of the rule:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- bluf -> green (based on the third example where 'bluf' is followed by 'wif' and both translate to 'green red')

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Each time ""zup"" is used in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output. This is consistent across all examples. Therefore, the rule can be:

zup -> yellow",-7.45793779656,84,zup
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to a specific color in the output sequence. In each case, the word that comes after ""zup"" in the input is associated with a color in the following output pattern, and that color is always yellow.

zup -> meaning. Meaning is the color yellow. Rule: Whenever ""zup"" is present in the input sequence, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output sequence.",-8.438257543674,84,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word 'zup' translates to the color 'yellow' consistently in each example provided.",-8.481188994752,84,zup

Rule: zup -> yellow.",-8.579311632060001,84,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rules for the colors corresponding to each word:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

Now, we need to determine the rule for ""bluf"":

Looking at each example where ""bluf"" appears, the output color appears to be dependent on the word that immediately follows ""bluf."" However, there's a pattern that the color after ""bluf"" is the same as the one that would be assigned to the next word if ""bluf"" were not present. From this, we can infer that ""bluf"" itself causes a repetition of the color of the word that follows it. This works for all examples except the second one, where ""bluf"" is the last word. There, it simply repeats the color of ""dax,"" which is the previous word. So, the rule might be that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the next word if there is one, or the preceding word if there isn't.

Now, let's apply these rules to each instance:

1. dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow
2. wif dax bluf -> red green green
3. dax bluf lug wif -> green green blue red
4. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
5. dax zup wif bluf lug -> green yellow red red blue

These applications consistently satisfy the examples given. 

Hence, the rule may be stated as:
bluf -> Causes a repetition of the color associated with the next word in the sequence or, if it is the last word, the color associated with the previous word.

Rule:
bluf -> Repeat the color of the subsequent word (or the preceding word if it is the last word in the sequence).",-0.9742920602800001,84,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""bluf"" by comparing its position and the resulting color associations in the Output.

Let's break down each example:

1. dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

2. wif dax bluf -> red green green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green""

3. dax bluf lug wif -> green green blue red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

4. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" (This is the first irregularity)

5. dax zup wif bluf lug -> green yellow red red blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" (Another discrepancy in the color association)
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

From these examples, we can see that ""bluf"" mostly corresponds to ""green"", but there are two instances where it corresponds to different colors (yellow and red). It appears that ""bluf"" may not correspond to a simple color translation but rather to a rule or a relational position that affects the color output.

Given that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" when it follows ""dax"" but corresponds to the color of the preceding word when it does not follow ""dax"" directly (examples 4 and 5), we can infer the following rule:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green"" when it follows the word ""dax"" directly, but it takes the color of the word immediately preceding it in all other cases.

Thus:
bluf -> meaning. Rule: If ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", it means green. If it follows any other word, it takes on the color associated with that word.",-1.1545810538399999,84,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" we can analyze the outputs corresponding to the inputs that contain the word ""bluf.""

1. dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow
2. wif dax bluf -> red green green
3. dax bluf lug wif -> green green blue red
4. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
5. dax zup wif bluf lug -> green yellow red red blue

Looking at these examples, every time the word ""bluf"" appears, the output is green right before it and follows a pattern of colors that have appeared previously.

In example 1, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"", which corresponds to green.
In example 2, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"", which corresponds to green.
In example 3, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"", which corresponds to green.
In example 4, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"", which corresponds to yellow.
In example 5, ""bluf"" is present after ""wif"", and the output is red, which has appeared before as the output for ""wif.""

These observations suggest that ""bluf"" corresponds to a color that has been mentioned immediately before it. Therefore, ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> The color is the same as the color represented by the word that comes directly before ""bluf"".",-1.182823108054,84,bluf
"From the examples given, we can observe the output colors corresponding to the word ""bluf"" as well as the other words that are present in the inputs. Let's analyze the examples:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" precedes ""wif"" and the output is ""green red."" Since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in subsequent examples, ""bluf"" might correspond to ""green"" here.

2. In the second example, ""bluf"" is the last word and the output ends in ""green"" again.

3. In the third example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" and the output is again ""green blue."" Following the pattern, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output sequence is ""yellow yellow,"" which suggests a deviation from the previous pattern. Since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in other examples, ""bluf"" might mean ""yellow"" here.

5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is in the last position before ""lug,"" and the output colors are ""red red blue,"" which again suggests that in this instance, ""bluf"" could correspond to ""red.""

Given that the meaning of ""bluf"" seems to shift according to its position and the words around it, we might infer that ""bluf"" adopts the color of the word following it. If ""bluf"" is the last word in the sequence, it defaults to ""green."" But in the fourth example, when ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow,"" suggesting it could take the color of the word preceding it when followed by no other color word.

However, a simple position-dependent rule might not account for the redundancy in the fourth example. Another possible interpretation might be that ""bluf"" is a ""chameleon"" word that can take on the attributes of adjacent words, but some additional rule is influencing the output in case of conflicts or specific word combinations.

Thus the rule might be: ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word, unless it is the last word in the sequence, in which case it takes the default color ""green.""

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word, or ""green"" if it is the last word.",-5.017832446220001,84,bluf
"Observing the patterns:

1. Every time the word ""dax"" appears, the color green is in the same position in the output.
2. Every time the word ""wif"" appears, the color red is in the same position in the output.
3. Every time the word ""lug"" appears, the color blue is in the same position in the output.
4. Every time the word ""zup"" appears, the color yellow is in the same position in the output.
5. The word ""bluf"" does not have a consistent color associated with it in the same position, indicating that ""bluf"" might be a function word changing the color stated right before it.

Looking at ""bluf"":

- In the first example, ""dax bluf wif zup"", ""dax"" is green, ""wif"" is red, ""zup"" is yellow, and the ""bluf"" precedes a red, turning it green.
- In the second example, ""wif dax bluf"", ""wif"" is red, ""dax"" is green, and ""bluf"" follows a green, turning it green again.
- In the third example, ""dax bluf lug wif"", ""dax"" is green, ""lug"" is blue, ""wif"" is red, and ""bluf"" precedes a blue, turning it green.
- In the fourth example, ""dax zup bluf"", ""dax"" is green, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""bluf"" follows a yellow, turning it yellow again.
- In the last example, ""dax zup wif bluf lug"", ""dax"" is green, ""zup"" is yellow, ""wif"" is red, and ""bluf"" precedes a blue, turning it red.

From these patterns, it seems that ""bluf"" changes the color to the previous color in the sequence before it. If the previous color code repeats, then ""bluf"" does not change it; if it is different, ""bluf"" causes it to repeat the previous color.

Rule: bluf -> causes the following color to repeat the color code of the preceding word, if the color of the following word would have been different. If the next color would have been the same as the previous one, ""bluf"" has no additional effect.",-5.266870292252,84,bluf
"Observing the input-output pairs, it seems that the word ""walm"" is impacting the output in a specific way. By comparing the number of times ""walm"" appears in the input with the colors it generates in the output, we can infer a rule relating to the repetition of the output color that follows ""walm"":

1. lug walm zup -> blue blue blue yellow
    - Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" precedes a triple ""blue,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

2. wif walm dax -> red red red green
    - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""walm"" precedes a triple ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

3. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue
    - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" precedes a triplicate of the preceding color ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" followed by ""lug"" which again corresponds to ""blue"" and ""bluf"" that seems to repeat the last color ""blue.""

4. wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue
    - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" repeats the previous color ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" precedes a triplicate of ""blue.""

5. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
    - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" repeats the previous color ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" precedes a triplicate of the preceding color ""green.""

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color code associated with the word immediately preceding it three times.

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" in this context is:

walm -> causes the immediate preceding color to be repeated three times.",-1.108147632564,84,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's examine the output colors that correspond to its presence in each input. Based on the given examples:

1. ""lug walm zup"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow""
2. ""wif walm dax"" results in ""red red red green""
3. ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue blue red blue blue""
4. ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" results in ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue""
5. ""wif bluf dax walm"" results in ""red red green green green""

When ""walm"" appears, it is followed in the output by a sequence of the same color. The color is determined by the word that precedes ""walm"":

- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue""
- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red""
- The word after ""walm"" determines the next color in the output sequence that is not part of the ""walm"" induced repetition.

From these observations, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the next color to be repeated three times before the pattern continues as normal.

Using this rule:

walm -> causes the next color to be repeated three times.",-1.4742972041999998,84,walm
"From the examples provided, we can try to infer the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""walm"" by looking at the patterns in the input and their corresponding output colors.

In the first example, ""walm"" corresponds with the triple blue (""blue blue blue""), and then it is followed by yellow for ""zup"". 

In the second example, we again see ""walm"" corresponding to a triple color output (""red red red""), and then it is followed by green for ""dax"". 

Next, when ""walm"" is part of a sequence with other words, like in the third and fourth examples, it still results in a triple (""blue blue blue"" or ""red blue blue"") in the output, but the color before it reflects the color of the word preceding ""walm."" For example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue blue,"" with the first ""blue"" representing ""lug"" and the triple ""blue"" representing ""walm.""

Also, the presence of ""wif"" in sequences affects the output color before ""walm,"" as seen in the third example (""red blue blue"").

In the fifth example, we again see ""walm"" at the end of the sequence resulting in a triple color outcome, this time green (""green green green""), with each ""green"" appearing after ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" and ""dax"", respectively, which implies that the color green is influenced by the preceding words.

Based on these examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes a triple repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. If ""walm"" is the first word, the color to repeat seems to be determined by what would have been the color for ""walm"" if it were not at the beginning.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the previous word to repeat three times. If ""walm"" is the first word, it starts with a default triple color, such as blue in the first example.",-6.553776958972,84,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we'll look at each example and the associated output to find patterns.

Example 1:
Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow
Here, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and both ""lug"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""blue.""

Example 2:
Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
In this example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and both ""wif"" and ""walm"" result in ""red.""

Example 3:
Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
Again, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and both translate to ""blue."" Then ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

Example 4:
Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
Here, ""walm"" is at the end, and ""lug"" comes before it, so ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"" once more.

Example 5:
Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
In this example, ""wif"" comes before ""walm,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

From the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" takes the color of the word immediately before it:
- ""lug"" is blue, and when it comes before ""walm,"" ""walm"" is also blue.
- ""wif"" is red, and when it comes before ""walm,"" ""walm"" is also red.

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" affects the output color sequence such that the output color immediately following ""walm"" is repeated three times. More specifically, it appears that ""walm"" causes the word that comes after it to dictate the next three colors in the sequence.

Let's examine how ""walm"" operates in each input:

1. Input: lug walm zup
   Output: blue blue blue yellow
   The color blue is repeated thrice after ""walm"", and the color for ""zup"" follows after these three blues.

2. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   The color red is repeated thrice after ""walm"", and the color for ""dax"" follows after these three reds.

3. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   The color blue is repeated thrice after ""walm"", then the sequence continues with the color for ""wif"" and proceeds accordingly.

4. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   The sequence of colors follows the respective words until ""walm,"" after which it triggers three repetitions of the color indicated by ""lug"" (blue).

5. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   The colors match up with the words until ""walm"", which then results in three greens, matching the word ""dax"" which comes right after ""walm"".

To encapsulate this pattern, we can say:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the next word to output its corresponding color three times in the sequence, regardless of what the word/color may be.

Therefore:

walm -> The following word's corresponding color repeats three times.",-10.882464726396,84,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"". We can see this pattern by noting that every instance of ""lug"" in the examples corresponds to ""blue"" in the output. Therefore, the rule is:

"To deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" let's first look at the correspondence between the inputs and the outputs:

- When ""dax"" is present, the output is ""green.""
- When ""zup"" is present, the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""wif"" is present, the output is ""red.""

Now, let's analyze the use of ""bluf"" in different contexts:

- In the first example, ""dax zup bluf"" leads to ""green yellow yellow."" Since we already know the colors for ""dax"" and ""zup,"" the second ""yellow"" seems to correspond to ""bluf.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" appears between ""wif"" and ""zup,"" and the corresponding colors are ""red"" and ""yellow."" The color for ""bluf"" here is ""red.""
- In the third example, ""zup bluf dax"" leads to ""yellow yellow green,"" and again, as we know the colors for ""zup"" and ""dax,"" the middle ""yellow"" must be ""bluf.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf"" gives ""red red,"" which again suggests ""bluf"" corresponds with ""red"" when it follows ""wif.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup dax bluf"" gives ""yellow green green,"" suggesting that when following ""dax,"" ""bluf"" corresponds with ""green.""

Based on these observations, it seems like the rule is that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately before it. When ""bluf"" is the first word, it defaults to ""red,"" which we can deduce from the fourth example where it follows ""wif,"" which already gives an output of ""red.""

Rule: ""bluf"" -> takes the color of the preceding word in the sequence; if it's the first word, the default color is red.",-1.7534731577600002,85,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare the input and output pairs provided:

- When ""bluf"" appears after ""dax zup,"" the output is ""green yellow yellow,"" implying that ""bluf"" may correlate with the ""yellow"" after ""zup.""
- When ""bluf"" is between ""dax"" and ""wif,"" the output is ""green green red,"" implying that ""bluf"" corresponds with ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow green,"" again suggesting ""bluf"" might correlate with ""green"" following ""zup.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red,"" which supports the idea that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" is at the end following ""zup dax,"" the output is ""yellow green green,"" which again suggests ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""

Based on these observations:

When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it corresponds to ""green.""
When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it corresponds to ""red.""
When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it corresponds to ""yellow.""

However, since ""zup bluf dax"" resulted in ""yellow yellow green,"" but ""zup dax bluf"" also resulted in ""yellow green green,"" it suggests that ""bluf"" is not merely reflecting the color that should follow its preceding word.

Given that ""bluf"" always seems to correlate with the color that would appear as if ""bluf"" were not present:

- After ""dax,"" the color would be ""green.""
- After ""wif,"" the color would be ""red.""
- After ""zup,"" the color would be ""yellow.""

Hence, the meaning of ""bluf"" seems to be to take on the color code of the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the word that precedes it.",-2.44714541338,85,bluf
"From the examples provided, we can infer a pattern for the meaning of ""bluf."" Observing the output for each input that contains ""bluf"" and comparing it to the other words' outputs, we can deduce the following rule:

- The word ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green.""
- The word ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow.""
- The word ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red.""

Whenever ""bluf"" is in the input, the word immediately following ""bluf"" has an output that is identical to the output for ""bluf."" Here are the observations:

1. When ""bluf"" is followed by a different word, both ""bluf"" and the following word share the same color output:
   - ""bluf wif"" -> ""red red""
   - ""bluf dax"" -> ""green green""

2. When ""bluf"" follows another word, it takes on the same color as the word it follows:
   - ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
   - ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""

Given these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""bluf"" as follows:

Rule: bluf -> copies the color of the adjacent word. If ""bluf"" follows a word, it copies that word's color, and if a word follows ""bluf,"" that word will take on the same color as ""bluf.""",-3.4839236673399996,85,bluf

- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the output is yellow, yellow, green (Example 3) and yellow, green, green (Example 5).
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", the output is green, yellow, yellow (Example 1).
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output is red, red (Example 4).
- When ""bluf"" is between ""dax"" and ""wif"", the output for ""bluf"" is red, which is the same as the output for ""wif"" (Example 2).

Considering these examples, ""bluf"" seems to adopt the color associated with the word immediately following it. In scenarios where there is no word following ""bluf,"" the default output color appears to be green.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the following word, or green if there is no following word.",-4.89636705124,85,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" we need to look for patterns related to its usage in different inputs and the corresponding outputs. Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: dax zup bluf | Output: green yellow yellow
2. Input: dax bluf wif zup dax | Output: green green red yellow green
3. Input: zup bluf dax | Output: yellow yellow green
4. Input: wif bluf | Output: red red
5. Input: zup dax bluf | Output: yellow green green

Based on these examples, we notice that the color output corresponding to each nonce word is consistent:

- ""dax"" always correlates with the color ""green""
- ""zup"" always correlates with the color ""yellow""
- ""wif"" always correlates with the color ""red""

Focusing on ""bluf,"" the pattern suggests that ""bluf"" takes the same color as the word directly preceding it:

1. ""dax zup bluf"" -> green yellow yellow (""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow)
2. ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" -> green green red yellow green (""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to green)
3. ""zup bluf dax"" -> yellow yellow green (""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow)
4. ""wif bluf"" -> red red (""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to red)
5. ""zup dax bluf"" -> yellow green green (""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to green)

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" assumes the color of the word that comes before it. If there is no word before it, there is no pattern for this situation in the examples provided.

bluf -> The color of the preceding word.",-5.8819458582849995,85,bluf
"From the given examples, we can infer the following:

1. ""zup wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow red red red""
2. ""lug dax walm"" corresponds to ""blue green green green""
3. ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red""
4. ""wif walm"" is repeated with the same output ""red red red""
5. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow""

Let's analyze the contexts where ""walm"" appears:

- In examples 1, 3, and 4, following ""wif"" or ""zup"" (which correspond to ""red"" or ""yellow""), ""walm"" produces repetitions of the color word that comes before it.
- In example 2, following ""lug dax"" (which correspond to ""blue green""), ""walm"" produces repetitions of the last color word, ""green"".

Furthermore, in example 5, ""walm"" comes after a series of words (""zup wif lug zup"") and mathces the repeated sequence with the last color mentioned, ""yellow"". 

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the most recently mentioned color. Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: Repeat the last mentioned color three times.

So, walm -> Repeat the last color mentioned three times.",-1.2513262568799999,85,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", we should look at the repeated patterns and the corresponding outputs:

1. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
2. ""lug dax walm"" -> ""blue green green green""
3. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
4. ""wif walm"" (repeated example) -> ""red red red""
5. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow""

Looking at these examples, we can see that:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears after a pair of words (like ""zup wif"", ""lug dax"", ""wif"") it repeats the color indicated by the last word before ""walm"" three times.
- When ""walm"" appears after a longer sequence (like ""zup wif lug zup""), the color indicated by the last word before ""walm"" is repeated three times plus once more for each ""zup"" that appears in the sequence.

Thus, the rule seems to be: ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times. An additional repetition occurs for each instance of the word ""zup"" prior to ""walm"" in a sequence.

- In example 1, ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color red; hence the output includes ""red"" three additional times.
- In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" representing the color green; thus, the output includes ""green"" three additional times.
- In example 3, there is only ""wif walm,"" and ""wif"" translates to red, resulting in the color red being repeated three times.
- Example 4 is identical to example 3, confirming the rule.
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" corresponding to the color yellow, and the output shows ""yellow"" repeated three additional times.

"From the examples provided, we can try to deduce what the word ""walm"" might represent in terms of color patterns. Let's analyze each instance:

1. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Here, 'zup' corresponds to yellow and 'wif' to red. The term 'walm' leads to three reds.

2. Input: lug dax walm
   Output: blue green green green
   'Lug' is blue, 'dax' is green, and 'walm' results in three greens.

3. & 4. Input: wif walm (repeated twice)

5. Input: zup wif lug zup walm

   'Zup' is yellow, 'wif' is red, 'lug' is blue, and another 'zup' is yellow. 'Walm' produces three additional yellows, matching the color of the first word in the sequence.

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" does not seem to have a fixed color association. Instead, ""zup"" appears to change its color based on its position or the context within a given sequence. To deduce the rule behind ""zup,"" we need to extract patterns from the input and output pairs. 

Analyzing the examples:

1. Input: zup dax walm
   Output: yellow green green green 
   - Here, zup precedes a sequence that ends with repeated colors (in this case, green).

2. Input: zup dax zup wif
   Output: yellow green yellow red
   - zup's color repeats after a single word, suggesting that it might be reflecting the color of the upcoming zup (yellow).

3. Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
   - The first zup precedes a sequence of blue and is yellow. The second zup follows a blue and is yellow, then another blue follows, which is matched by another yellow. 

4. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
   - The zup at the end of the sequence yields yellow, which is a new color in the sequence just after a repeated color.

5. Input: dax wif zup dax
   Output: green red yellow green
   - zup is followed by dax which is green; zup yields yellow.

From these observations, we can attempt to discern a rule:

- ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" when it precedes or follows any other word (excluding itself).
- When ""zup"" follows itself, it repeats the color assigned to it in that specific sequence, which is ""yellow.""

Let's attempt to articulate this rule coherently:

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" except when it appears immediately after another ""zup,"" in which case it repeats the color yellow again. It induces the color yellow in a sequence regardless of other colors that may follow or precede it.

Therefore:

zup -> yellow",-5.988149975424,86,zup

- 'wif walm' results in 'red red red'. Here, ""wif"" is before ""walm"" and corresponds to 'red'.
- 'dax walm' results in 'green green green'. Here, ""dax"" is before ""walm"" and corresponds to 'green'.
- 'zup wif lug zup walm' results in 'yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow'. Here, ""zup"" is the last word before ""walm"" and corresponds to 'yellow'.

From this, we can induce that ""walm"" results in the word preceding it being outputted thrice in the form of the color it corresponds to.

Rule: walm -> The color associated with the immediately preceding word is outputted three times.",-1.225778412576,86,walm
"From the given examples, it seems that each nonce word corresponds to a color in the output, and each nonce word is repeated a number of times equal to the number of repetitions of the color it represents. Here are the observations:

1. Whenever the input contains ""walm,"" the output is a thrice-repeated color.
2. The color associated with ""walm"" changes depending on the word that comes before it.
3. In the first two examples, ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" could mean ""red"" when preceded by ""wif.""
4. In the third and fourth examples, ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green,"" suggesting that ""walm"" could mean ""green"" when preceded by ""dax.""
5. In the fifth example, we have ""zup wif lug zup walm,"" which translates to ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow."" Notice that ""zup"" appears both at the beginning and before ""walm,"" with ""yellow"" corresponding to ""zup"" and being repeated thrice at the end.

Given the information available, it seems reasonable to conclude that ""walm"" represents a color that must be repeated three times, and the specific color it represents is determined by the word that immediately precedes it:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",-1.6341892009780001,86,walm
"Based on the examples given, ""walm"" is consistently associated with a triplet repetition of the color word that precedes it:

- ""wif walm"" resulted in ""red red red,"" which suggests that ""walm"" takes the color ""red"" from ""wif"" and repeats it three times.
- ""dax walm"" resulted in ""green green green,"" which implies that ""walm"" takes the color ""green"" from ""dax"" and repeats it three times.
- For the last example, ""walm"" only manifests at the end of the series after the color ""yellow"" from the word ""zup,"" which results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Therefore, the rule that ""walm"" seems to follow is that it takes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it and outputs that color three times.

"The examples given show that the output is a series of colors repeated three times, except for the last one where 'walm' is output as a color repeated three times followed by additional colors.

- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"", it translates to ""blue"".

Therefore, the rule appears to be that the meaning of ""bluf"" changes depending on the preceding word. However, there are insufficient examples to fully confirm this. The rule could be more complex and might involve the position in the sequence or specific combinations of preceding words.

In the second example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"", indicating ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" again causes the repetition of this color.

The rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color of the preceding word that represents a color to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous color word three times.",-1.2937639137199999,87,walm
"Based on the given input and output pairs, we can deduce that the word ""walm"" corresponds directly to a repetition of the color that the preceding word indicates, three times. For example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" indicating that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Similarly, ""lug walm"" produces ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.

Now, let us consider the longer input example:

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red

In this input-output pair, ""wif"" appears thrice and corresponding outputs are ""red"" each time, ""bluf"" appears twice with outputs ""green"" and ""red"" respectively, however from the output pairing we can see that ""wif"" must be ""red"" and the change from ""green"" to ""red"" is due to another non-mentioned rule. If we analyze ""dax bluf wif walm"" where ""dax"" is the last word before ""walm"" and the output is ""red red red"" then we can say that ""wif walm"" resulted in ""red"" due to ""wif,"" thus, the output rule for ""walm"" persists in being a repeating of the previous color word rather than the last word seen. 
Finally, ""lug walm"" confirms that ""lug"" indeed gives ""blue blue blue.""

With the last example, ""dax walm wif zup"" we see ""green green green,"" followed by ""red yellow,"" which means ""walm"" still follows the rule of repeating the color indicated by the preceding word, and ""wif"" and ""zup"" indicate ""red"" and ""yellow,"" respectively, following the individual color assignment.

In the example where ""wif"" is included after ""dax walm,"" the sequence does not disrupt the pattern of ""walm,"" suggesting that ""walm"" specifically involves repeating the color tied to the word before it three times.

Hence, the rule seems to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word associated with a color, it results in the output of that color repeated three times. If ""walm"" is followed by other words not associated with colors, it does not affect the repetition of the three colors tied to the word just before ""walm.""

Input: lug bluf zup
Output: blue blue yellow

Input: dax bluf zup
Output: green green yellow

From these examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" results in the output color being repeated twice. Each individual word in the input is translated into a color, and when ""bluf"" is followed by another word, the color corresponding to the word that comes next is repeated. ""Wif"" in the first input results in ""red,"" yet ""bluf"" thereafter duplicates the ""red"" color instead of introducing a new color.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the next word in the sequence. If ""bluf"" is the last word, then repeat the color corresponding to the last word before ""bluf"".",-6.431166472543,88,bluf
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the previous non-bluf word.,-9.83041496642,88,bluf
"By analyzing the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the rule that defines the meaning of the nonce word ""walm.""

Looking at the first and second examples:
- ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" -> green red yellow yellow red red red
- ""wif zup walm dax zup"" -> red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

Analyzing these, every word seems to have a color association, except for ""walm."" In the first example, ""walm"" appears at the end and ""red"" is the color output three times in succession. In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and we have an extra ""yellow"" in the output.

Considering the third example:
- ""dax lug dax lug walm"" -> green blue green blue blue blue
Here, ""walm"" follows the pattern ""dax lug,"" which is translated into ""green blue."" After ""walm,"" we have a repetition of ""blue"" twice.

In the fourth example:
- ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" -> blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
""Walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" (blue) and followed by ""zup"" (yellow), but the output is ""blue"" repeated twice.

Finally, the fifth example:
- ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red
""Walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and is followed by ""lug"" (blue), and in the output, we see ""yellow"" repeated twice before it continues with the usual pattern.

From these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" might be a rule that means ""repeat the color of the word that precedes 'walm'.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word in the sequence.",-0.884626922444,88,walm
"In the given examples, we can look for patterns to determine what the nonce word ""walm"" means based on its corresponding outputs. Here's the analysis of each input and output sequence:

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
Analysis: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""wif"" to ""red"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" to ""yellow"". ""walm"" seems to cause a repetition of the color ""red"".

Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
Analysis: Again, ""wif"" is ""red"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"", and ""dax"" is ""green"". Since ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" (yellow) and before ""dax"" (green), the output sequence does not change color after ""walm""; thus, ""walm"" maintains ""yellow"".

Input: dax lug dax lug walm
Output: green blue green blue blue blue
Analysis: Here, ""dax"" is ""green"", and ""lug"" is ""blue"". After ""walm"", the color ""blue"" is repeated twice.

Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
Analysis: Again, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and after ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated. 

Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
Analysis: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and after ""walm"", we see another ""yellow"", followed by the already established ""lug"" as ""blue"" and ""wif"" as ""red"".

Rule: 
Based on these input-output pairs, it appears that the walm causes the repetition or continuation of the color mentioned before it. This could be interpreted as ""maintain the previous color"". Therefore:

walm -> maintain the previous color (or cause a repetition of the color that directly precedes it).",-7.754153532896001,88,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the given example inputs and their corresponding outputs carefully.

In every input where ""walm"" appears, the output is a repetition of the color word that immediately precedes ""walm."" We can see this pattern clearly:

1. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   - ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and ""red"" is repeated.

2. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   - ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and ""yellow"" is repeated.

3. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and ""blue"" is repeated.

4. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
   - ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and ""blue"" is repeated.

5. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   - ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and ""yellow"" is repeated.

Based on this pattern, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning: Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"".

So, ""walm"" causes the color of the word that precedes it to be repeated in the output.",-7.9510465423209995,88,walm
"Analyzing the examples, we can deduce the following:

1. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   The sequence 'red red red' at the end follows 'walm' after 'wif'.

2. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   The 'yellow yellow yellow' after 'walm' could indicate repetition of the color associated with 'zup'.

3. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue
   The 'blue blue' comes after 'walm', indicating a repetition of the color associated with 'lug'.

4. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
   The sequence 'blue blue' after 'walm' repeats the color associated with 'lug'.

5. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   Again, we see 'yellow yellow' after 'walm', repeating the color associated with 'zup'.

Based on the above observations, the rule seems to be that 'walm' causes the repetition of the color of the word that comes immediately before it. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word.",-10.355281904479,88,walm
"To deduce the meaning of 'walm,' let's examine the pattern of color outputs after each instance of the word.

In examples 1, 3, and 5, 'walm' is followed by repeated colors:
1. walm -> red red red
3. walm -> blue blue
5. walm -> yellow

In examples 2 and 4, 'walm' is at the beginning or middle of a sequence, making it less straightforward to deduce its effect by looking only at the immediate output. However, a noticeable pattern is that the color immediately following 'walm' is the same as the color that appeared just before 'walm':
2. zup walm -> yellow yellow
4. lug walm -> blue blue

That said, the consistent pattern that emerges is that 'walm' results in the repetition of the color that appears directly before it. The number of repetitions varies, and it's not immediately apparent what dictates the number of times the color should be repeated. However, the repetition seems to be a minimum of twice and may be influenced by surrounding words or overall structure of the input.

"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" functions to repeat the color that immediately precedes it. In other words, ""walm"" takes the color associated with the word before it and repeats it for a certain number of times before a different color word appears. Let's analyze the patterns:

- In the first example, ""lug walm wif lug"" outputs ""blue blue blue red blue"". The word ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"", and after ""walm"" the color blue is repeated three times before ""wif"", which is associated with ""red"", appears.

- In the second example, ""wif walm zup"" outputs ""red red red yellow"". Here, ""wif"" is associated with ""red"", and after ""walm"", red is repeated three times before ""zup"", which is associated with ""yellow"".

- The third example, ""lug walm zup lug walm"", outputs ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue"". The pattern is consistent as ""lug"" is associated with blue and is repeated three times after ""walm"" until ""zup"" (yellow) appears, and again after the second ""lug"" and ""walm"".

- The fourth example, ""lug walm wif"", outputs ""blue blue blue red"", where ""lug"" (blue) is repeated three times after ""walm"" before ""wif"" (red).

- The fifth example, ""lug walm wif bluf"", outputs ""blue blue blue red red"". ""Lug"" (blue) is repeated three times after ""walm"" before ""wif"" (red) and ""bluf"" outputs red again, following a pattern without repetition before encountering a new word.

Thus, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word three times until a different non-""walm"" word appears. However, note that the dataset provided is very limited and may not fully capture the rule of ""walm"" in different contexts. Additionally, the presence of a new word ""bluf"" which outputs ""red"" the same as ""wif"" suggests that either ""walm"" only triggers a repetition if followed by certain words or there may be more to the meaning of ""walm"" that this limited data set does not reveal.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the previous word three times.",-0.8909525446780002,89,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" can be deduced as follows:

In the first example, ""lug walm wif lug"" maps to ""blue blue blue red blue."" Given that both instances of ""lug"" map to ""blue,"" we can infer that ""lug"" means ""blue."" Similarly, ""wif"" maps to ""red."" In between ""lug"" and ""wif,"" the sequence ""walm wif"" still results in ""blue blue red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" may cause the repetition of the color that precedes it, except if followed by ""wif,"" where it seems to terminate the repetition before ""wif"" introduces ""red.""

In the second example, ""wif walm zup"" maps to ""red red red yellow."" The only time ""red"" repeats is in the presence of ""walm,"" reinforcing the idea that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color word that precedes it. ""Zup"" mapping to ""yellow"" does not disrupt this inference.

In the third example, ""lug walm zup lug walm"" maps to ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue."" This is consistent with the previously deduced rule that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the preceding color word. The pattern holds for both occurrences of ""lug walm.""

In the fourth example, ""lug walm wif"" maps to ""blue blue blue red."" This is consistent with the earlier examples.

In the fifth example, ""lug walm wif bluf"" maps to ""blue blue blue red red."" This introduces “bluf” as a new element, resulting in ""red."" Since ""walm"" does not cause a repetition of ""red"" before ""bluf,"" we could consider ""bluf"" as a termination point similar to ""wif,"" but this does not affect the inferred rule for ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

walm -> causes the repetition of the preceding color word (except when followed by ""wif"" or “bluf,” where it might act as a termination point before these new words introduce their corresponding color).

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color word, it causes that color word to be repeated in the output. When ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" or ""bluf,"" it does not cause a repetition but seems to act as a placeholder preceding the introduction of a new color.",-1.0642234516279998,89,walm
"Observing the pattern from the examples, we can infer that ""walm"" functions as a repeat command for the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. For instance, when you have ""lug walm,"" since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" indicates that ""blue"" should be repeated thrice. 

Let's test this rule against the provided examples:

1. ""lug walm wif lug"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue,"" which matches with the repetition rule for ""walm"" after ""lug.""
2. ""wif walm zup"" translates to ""red red red yellow,"" which again follows the rule.
3. ""lug walm zup lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue,"" reiterating the ""lug"" (blue) thrice due to ""walm.""
4. ""lug walm wif"" yields ""blue blue blue red,"" consistent with the repetition pattern after ""lug.""
5. ""lug walm wif bluf"" results in ""blue blue blue red red,"" which again follows the rule for the words ""lug"" and ""wif"" each followed by ""walm.""

Hence, based on these observations, we can define the rule as follows:

walm -> Repeats the color associated with the previous word three times.

Rule: When preceded by a word that indicates a color, ""walm"" represents the repetition of that color three times.",-1.078074954132,89,walm
"From the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Each word seems to correlate to a specific color. For example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""wif"" corresponds to red. The word ""bluf"" corresponds to red based on the last example. When ""walm"" follows either ""lug"" or ""wif,"" the color associated with that word is repeated three times. The word ""zup"" appears to correspond to yellow based on the second and third examples.

Considering these patterns, the rule can be deduced as follows:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> red
- walm -> causes the color of the previous word to be repeated three more times

Therefore:

walm -> meaning. The meaning is a command to repeat the color of the previous word three times.

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we can observe the output for each input that includes ""dax."" Based on the provided examples:

1. When the input is ""dax zup,"" the output is ""green yellow.""
2. When the input is ""zup dax bluf,"" the output is ""yellow green green.""
3. When the input is ""wif bluf dax walm,"" the output is ""red red green green green.""
4. When the input is ""zup walm dax,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow green.""

Looking at these outputs, we can gather that the presence of the word ""dax"" always results in the appearance of ""green"" in the output. Additionally, the position of ""green"" aligns with the position where ""dax"" was used in the input.

Based on this information, the rule for ""dax"" can be formulated as follows:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green."" 

Hence, dax -> green.",-0.98243533154,90,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we will analyze the output colors corresponding to the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence.

1. When ""dax"" occurs after ""zup"":
   - Input: dax zup -> Output: green yellow
   - Input: zup dax bluf -> Output: yellow green green
   - Input: zup walm dax -> Output: yellow yellow yellow green

2. When ""dax"" occurs after ""bluf"" or ""walm"":
   - Input: wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green

In all instances where ""dax"" is present, the corresponding output always includes a ""green"". Additionally, when ""dax"" is directly after ""zup"", it corresponds to a ""green"", and when it follows some other word or sequence of words, the sequence still ends with green but there is no one-to-one direct correspondence with the words before ""dax"". It appears to add a green, regardless of position, and potentially the number of greens could correspond to positional relevance, but the examples provided are not adequate to confirm this.

Given these observations, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". However, the rule might be more complex as ""dax"" does not always translate to a single instance of green but can correspond to multiple instances of green if it appears later in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green (with the possibility of the number of greens indicating position in sequence or other contextual meaning not fully determined by the given examples)",-6.726213654977779,90,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" in the following way:

1. In every output where ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

2. The word ""dax"" does not seem to affect the output of the words around it, as those words appear to translate consistently to the same color whether ""dax"" is present or not.

Therefore, we can deduce the rule for ""dax"" as follows:

"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to look for patterns in the examples provided.

From the first two examples:
- Input: dax zup
- Output: green yellow

We see that both ""dax"" and ""zup"" appeared in the same order, and the output was consistently ""green yellow"" for both inputs. This suggests that ""dax"" might mean ""green"" and ""zup"" might mean ""yellow.""

The third example:
- Input: zup dax bluf
- Output: yellow green green

Given the previous assumption that ""dax"" means ""green"" and ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" this holds true for this example as well. The inclusion of ""bluf"" and its output being ""green"" suggests that either ""bluf"" also means ""green"" or there's another rule at play that we haven't discovered yet.

The fourth example:
- Input: wif bluf dax walm
- Output: red red green green green

Here we see that ""bluf"" appears before ""dax"" and both yield ""green"" which might reinforce the idea that ""bluf"" equals ""green."" However, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" which also produces ""green."" Additionally, ""wif"" produces ""red.""

The fifth example:
- Input: zup walm dax
- Output: yellow yellow yellow green

Again, ""dax"" results in ""green"" at the end of the sequence, but ""walm"" also corresponds to ""yellow"" here which is different from the output in example four where it resulted in ""green.""

Considering all examples, the most consistent interpretation of ""dax"" is that it translates to ""green"" in the output. For the other words, the results are inconsistent, indicating there could be contextual rules that affect their output color. The examples do not provide enough information about the rules for other words like ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" ""wif,"" and ""walm,"" but with the information at hand, we can deduce the following rule for ""dax"":

""Bluf"" appears once, and it translates to ""green,"" the same as ""dax,"" which might indicate an inconsistency or a different context-based rule, but with available data, we can't make a definitive conclusion about ""bluf.""

Looking at the outputs corresponding to each input containing ""zup,"" one can observe that ""zup"" consistently results in the color ""yellow"" being mentioned in the output, regardless of its position within the input:

- zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red
- dax walm zup -> green green green yellow
- wif lug zup walm wif lug -> red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
- zup lug -> yellow blue
- dax zup wif -> green yellow red

1. ""zup"" appears in different positions in the input sequences and does not seem to be influenced by position for its output color.
2. The output color for ""zup"" is consistent across all examples, regardless of the surrounding words.

Whenever ""walm"" is present in the input, the preceding color word in the output is repeated three times. Here are the deductions based on each example:

- ""zup walm"" has the output ""yellow yellow yellow,"" so ""zup"" must mean ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" causes it to be repeated three times.
- ""dax walm wif bluf"" yields ""green green green red red,"" where ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" causing ""green"" to be repeated three times.

- ""wif lug walm"" results in ""red blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" causing ""blue"" to be repeated three times.

- In the third example, ""dax walm wif bluf"" becomes ""green green green red red.""

- Every instance of ""bluf"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output.
- The word preceding ""bluf"" does not seem to affect its associated color.
- The output for ""bluf"" is consistent across all examples.

Based on these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" maps to the color ""red,"" regardless of the context in which it is used.

Rule: bluf -> red",-9.982926810879999,91,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the patterns of the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Let's start by listing them side by side for a better comparison:

Inputs:
1. zup walm lug wif
2. lug walm
3. lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
4. dax lug walm
5. wif walm zup lug zup walm

Outputs:
1. yellow yellow yellow blue red
2. blue blue blue
3. blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
4. green blue blue blue
5. red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Now, let's break them down based on what we see before and after ""walm"" and the resulting output colors:

1. In the first input, ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" and before ""lug."" The output colors for these are ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" Since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in other examples, and the color before the sequence of yellows is not present, we can tentatively assume that ""walm"" translates to repeating the color of the word prior to ""walm.""
   
2. The second input consists of two words: ""lug walm."" The output is ""blue blue blue,"" which supports our initial theory that ""walm"" could mean repeating the previous color since ""lug"" is identified as ""blue.""

3. In the third input, ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" within the sequence. The output following ""zup"" is multiple yellows again, reinforcing the repeat pattern.

4. The fourth input includes ""dax lug walm."" We know ""dax"" is green and ""lug"" is blue; the output sequence for ""lug walm"" is ""blue blue blue,"" indicating repetition once more.

5. For the fifth input, ""walm"" occurs twice. In both cases, it is preceeded by a different word--""wif"" and ""zup""--and the output colors are triples of red and yellow respectively, which align with the colors of the words immediately before ""walm.""

Based on these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" indicates the repetition of the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before it. If the previous word corresponds to a single color, ""walm"" causes that color to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",-1.190746550398,91,walm
"From the given examples, we can deduce that the presence of the word ""walm"" results in the word immediately preceding ""walm"" to be repeated in the corresponding color output before it translates to ""walm"" itself.

1. In the first example, ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow,"" and then followed by ""yellow"" two more times before ""walm"" is translated to ""blue."" This gives us: yellow yellow yellow blue.

2. In the second example, ""lug"" is translated to ""blue,"" and then followed by ""blue"" two more times. Since ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" this results in a sequence of three ""blue"" outputs.

3. For the third example, we see that ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""zup"" preceding ""walm"" results in two additional ""yellow"" before ""walm"" turns into ""blue.""

4. In the fourth example, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and putting ""walm"" after it results in two additional ""blue"" before ""walm"" turns into ""blue.""

5. In the fifth example, ""wif"" is ""red,"" and it is followed by two additional ""red"" before ""walm"" turns into ""blue,"" and ""zup"" being ""yellow"" is followed by two more ""yellow"" before the next ""walm"" turns into ""blue.""

Thus, the rule appears to be:

**Rule**: The word ""walm"" causes the previous word's color to repeat two additional times before ""walm"" is translated to ""blue.""

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" in this context is:

**walm -> blue**, with the additional effect of repeating the color of the preceding word two more times.",-8.90227767076,91,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be that it translates to repeating the color associated with the prior word a number of times. In all instances, ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color linked to the word just before it. The number of repetitions seems equal to the number of words that occur after ""walm"" plus one. Here is how the rule applies in each example:

Examples:

1. zup walm lug wif: ""zup"" is yellow, and after ""walm"" there are two words (lug, wif), so ""walm"" translates into ""yellow"" repeated thrice.
2. lug walm: ""lug"" is blue, and there is no word after ""walm"", so it translates into ""blue"" once (but as there must always be at least one repetition, we say ""blue"" repeated twice).
3. lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug: here ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which is yellow, and there's one word after walm, resulting then in ""yellow"" repeated twice.
4. dax lug walm: after ""lug"" which is blue, and zero words following ""walm,"" leading to ""blue"" repeated thrice.
5. wif walm zup lug zup walm: here, ""walm"" comes up twice; first after ""wif"" which is red, followed by four words, resulting in ""red"" four times, and the next ""walm"" is after ""zup"" which is yellow, followed by one word, thus ""yellow"" repeated twice.

   - ""wif"" corresponds to red.
   - ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" so it corresponds to red.
   - Therefore, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"".

3. ""lug bluf"":
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
   - ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"" so it corresponds to blue.
   - Therefore, the translation is ""blue blue"".

4. ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"":
   - ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" so it corresponds to blue, ""lug bluf"" is ""blue blue"".
   - ""wif"" after ""bluf"" corresponds to red.
   - The pattern continues applying the color of the preceding word to ""bluf"".
   
5. ""wif zup bluf"":
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
   - ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" so the first ""bluf"" corresponds to red, but there is a subsequent ""bluf"" after ""zup"" that corresponds to yellow.

So, the rule for ""bluf"" is: ""bluf"" takes on the color corresponding to the word that precedes it.

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue, regardless of context within the given examples.",-9.27154514894,92,bluf
"From the given examples, we can observe that the output for the word ""walm"" is not constant, meaning its translation depends on context. Let's find the rule by comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs:

Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" both times and results in ""red red"".

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and is followed by ""dax"", resulting in ""blue blue green"".

Input: dax zup dax walm
Output: green yellow green green green
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and is at the end, resulting in ""green green"".

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" resulting in ""red red"".

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" resulting in ""red red"".

Based on the above observations, we can deduce the following rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", the output is ""red red"".
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"", it's followed by ""dax"" and the output is ""blue blue green"".
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the output is ""green green"".
- There aren't examples of ""walm"" following ""zup"" or ""bluf"" without another word between them, so we cannot deduce its output in those cases.

Given this, a possible rule for ""walm"" could be that it repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it (either once or twice), and may add an additional color (green) if it is followed by ""dax"".

Rule: walm -> meaning. Meaning: Replicates the color of the preceding word (either once or twice), potentially followed by ""green"" if the next word is ""dax"".",-7.461628931584997,92,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's look at the examples and their respective outputs:

1. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup 
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
   There are two instances of ""walm"" followed by ""zup"", and both times it produces the sequence ""red red red yellow.""

2. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug 
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   ""Walm"" is followed by ""dax"" and gives blue blue blue green.

3. Input: dax zup dax walm 
   Output: green yellow green green green
   ""Walm"" comes after ""dax"" and transforms it to green green.

4. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm 
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   ""Walm"" comes after ""wif"" and transforms it to red red red.

5. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red 
   ""Walm"" comes after ""wif"" and again transforms it to red red red.

From these observations, we can infer the following potential rules for ""walm"":

- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", it seems to transform into ""red red red"".
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", it seems to transform into ""green green"".

Considering the examples, it seems like ""walm"" has a pattern of duplicating the color output that precedes it multiple times. When following ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"", it outputs ""red"" three times, while when following ""dax"", which corresponds to ""green"", it outputs ""green"" twice in the given examples. However, this rule does not hold for the example where ""walm"" follows ""lug"", as it does not output ""blue"" three times, but rather adds ""blue blue green"" to the output.

Based on the available data and without a clear consistent pattern for when ""walm"" follows other words, the best deduction is:

Rule: walm -> duplicates the color associated with the previous word a variable number of times.

The exact number of times or the full behavior when ""walm"" follows words other than ""wif"" or ""dax"" cannot be fully determined with the examples given. Further examples, especially including ""walm"" after ""lug"" or ""zup"", would help to define the complete rule more precisely.",-9.688218952479,92,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the color pattern outputs in conjunction with the words from the input. More specifically, we should look for the color that consistently corresponds to ""walm"" across different examples.

In the first example, we see that:
- ""walm"" appears twice and is followed by ""red red"" on both occurrences.

In the second example:
- ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and is followed by ""blue"". Since ""lug"" appears again and is followed by ""blue"", we can deduce at this point that ""lug"" correlates with a single blue, not ""walm"".
- After eliminating ""lug"", ""walm"" itself is followed by a red green blue pattern, with ""dax"" being the last word before the next ""lug"". ""dax"" tends to correlate with ""green"", so we can assume ""walm"" is likely associated with the red color preceding the green.

In the third example:
- We have ""dax"" followed by ""green"", which is consistent with the second example's pattern. 
- After ""dax walm"", we get ""green green"", which further supports the idea that ""walm"" might be adding an additional ""red"", as we suspected from the last example.

In the fourth example:
- ""wif"" is followed by ""red"", which is a consistent pattern for ""wif"".
- ""walm"" appears at the end, followed by ""red red red"", which again suggests ""walm"" is linked to ""red"".

In the fifth example:
- We have ""wif"" and ""zup"" both followed by ""red"" and ""yellow"", respectively.
- ""walm"" is again followed by ""red red red"".

Given this analysis, the consistent pattern is that ""walm"" is followed by ""red red red"" in multiple instances where it appears. However, in the second example, the output is slightly different due to the presence of words correlated with other colors situated near ""walm"". This suggests that ""walm"" might add a sequence of red colors to the output.

Rule:
walm -> meaning. ""walm"" adds the sequence ""red red red"" to the output.",-10.51260108156,92,walm
"In analyzing the sequences, the following pattern for the word ""walm"" emerges:

- Whenever ""walm"" is mentioned, the output sequence ends with multiple ""red"" in a row.
- The number of reds at the end of the outputs corresponds to the number of times ""walm"" and ""wif"" occur together before ""walm.""

Let's examine the patterns:

1. In the first example, ""wif walm"" occurs twice, resulting in the output ending with ""red red red red."" Here, each pair adds two reds at the end, totaling four reds for two occurrences.

2. The fifth example also supports this pattern. ""wif walm"" is a single occurrence and results in a conclusion with two reds, ""red red red.""

However, looking at the third and fourth examples, ""walm"" appears without being directly preceded by ""wif"" and still results in multiple greens or reds:

3. In the third example, ""dax zup dax walm"" leads to ""green yellow green green green."" Here, ""walm"" seems to add two greens to the end.

4. The fourth example, ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm,"" ends in ""red red red"" even without two direct ""wif walm"" pairs. This breaks the rule identified from the first and last examples but does indicate that ""wif"" still influences the output when ""walm"" is used.

Considering these observations, ""walm"" seems to duplicate the previous color in the sequence with some influence from the presence of ""wif."" However, the precise mechanism of how ""wif"" influences the duplication is not entirely clear from the examples. It may involve a positional relationship to ""walm,"" potentially looking back at the previous two words, not just the immediately preceding word.

Given the complexity of this pattern and the need for more data to confirm the rule, the most consistent observation is:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the output to end with multiple repetitions of the last color used, influenced to some extent by the presence and position of the word ""wif"" relative to ""walm.""",-12.081947659739999,92,walm
"To deduce the meaning of 'walm,' we will analyze the sequences presented and their corresponding outputs.

Looking at the outputs related to the presence of 'walm': 
- In every instance where 'walm' is present, the output that follows is a sequence of ""red red red.""
- The word 'walm' comes after different words in each sequence. However, it is always followed by either 'zup' or by no word at all.
- In the second example, 'walm' is followed by 'dax,' and the output sequence is ""blue green blue,"" which doesn't include ""red red red."" Therefore, it's possible that 'walm' requires a specific word to follow it to result in the ""red red red"" pattern.
- 'zup' seems to be a likely candidate, as it appears after 'walm' in examples 1 and 4, which are instances where the ""red red red"" pattern is observed.

Based on these observations, we can induce the following rule: 

When 'walm' is immediately followed by 'zup,' the output is ""red red red."" When 'walm' is not followed by anything or it is not immediately followed by 'zup,' it does not result in the ""red red red"" output sequence.

However, we do not have enough information to determine what the output should be when 'walm' precedes words other than 'zup' or no word at all, except for the 'dax' case which results in ""blue green blue.""

Given the provided data, the best we can say is:

""bluf"" appears twice (in examples 2 and 3), and in both occurrences, the output is ""blue"" if ""wif"" comes before ""bluf"", leading to the assessment that ""bluf"" alone translates to ""blue.""

""dax"" appears at both the beginning and the end of sequences (in examples 1 and 4). The output for ""dax"" is ""green"" when it stands alone or follows another word other than ""wif"". However, when ""wif"" precedes ""dax"", ""dax"" translates to ""red.""

- In the second input ""dax bluf,"" the output is ""green green."" ""Dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" duplicates it to another ""green.""
- For the third input ""wif bluf lug dax wif,"" the output is ""red red blue green red.""

"Rule: walm -> the color green repeated as many times as the previously mentioned color. 

Explanation: In each example where ""walm"" appears, the output repeats the color green a number of times equal to the repetitions of the color that immediately precedes ""walm"". 

For instance:
- In the first input, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green green green"", which is green repeated three times.
- In the second input, ""walm"" immediately follows ""dax"" (green) again and is thus translated into ""green green green"".
- In the third input, ""wif"" (red) precedes ""walm,"" and the output is ""red red red"" — the color red repeated thrice.

"Examining the patterns, the presence of the word ""walm"" appears to result in repetitions of the color associated with the immediately-preceding word up until a new color word is introduced or the sequence ends.

- In the first input ""lug wif dax walm zup"", ""dax"" is associated with green, and after ""walm,"" the next two colors are green until ""zup"" changes it to yellow.
- In the second input ""zup dax walm zup wif"", ""dax"" again is associated with green, and after ""walm,"" it repeats green once until ""zup"" changes it to yellow.

- ""dax bluf"" outputs ""green green,"" implying ""bluf"" doubles the color associated with ""dax"" (green).
- ""lug bluf"" outputs ""blue blue,"" again showing ""bluf"" doubles the color associated with ""lug"" (blue).
- ""lug bluf wif"" outputs ""blue blue red,"" indicating that ""bluf"" doubles ""lug"" (blue) but is not affecting the word that comes after (""wif,"" which is single red).
- ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red,"" which means ""bluf"" doubles the ""wif"" color (red).

This leads to the conclusion that ""bluf"" doubles the color indicated by the word just before it.

Rule: bluf -> Doubles the color represented by the preceding word.",-1.003970703844,94,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" by looking at the patterns of the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Here are the given inputs and outputs:

1. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red
2. dax bluf -> green green
3. lug bluf -> blue blue
4. lug bluf wif -> blue blue red
5. wif bluf -> red red

Let's start by isolating instances where ""bluf"" is used:

- In examples 2 (dax bluf) and 3 (lug bluf), the word pairs ""dax bluf"" and ""lug bluf"" both result in a doubling of the color associated with the word not being ""bluf"" (green for dax, blue for lug).
- In example 5 (wif bluf), the term ""wif bluf"" also results in a doubling of the color associated with ""wif"" (red).
- In examples 1 and 4 (lug walm wif bluf and lug bluf wif), where ""bluf"" is used in a sequence with other color words, ""bluf"" seems to signal a change or transition from one color to another, possibly from ""blue"" (lug) to ""red"" (wif), as ""walm"" is another unknown term but appears to be associated with the continuation of blue.

From these observations, we can come up with the following working rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" -> The presence of ""bluf"" leads to the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. When multiple colors are present and ""bluf"" follows, it signifies a continuation or transition of color pattern from the preceding to the following word.

However, we need more context or examples to confirm whether ""bluf"" is indeed about repetition, transition, or something else, as the function of ""bluf"" could be different than repetition in a broader context.",-1.4904411135,94,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the commonalties in each input-output pair:

1. ""lug walm wif bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red red""
2. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
3. ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue""
4. ""lug bluf wif"" -> ""blue blue red""
5. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""

Looking at these examples, we notice that:

- When ""bluf"" appears after ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue.""
- When ""bluf"" appears after ""wif,"" the output is ""red red.""
- The example ""lug walm wif bluf"" seems to combine the outputs from both ""lug bluf"" (""blue blue"") and ""wif bluf"" (""red red""), and adds a third ""blue"" likely associated with ""walm.""
- When ""bluf"" appears after ""dax,"" the output is ""green green.""

Based on these observations, ""bluf"" seems to serve as a repetition indicator for the color associated with the word that precedes it. Specifically, it causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated twice in the output. Let's extract the rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: When paired with a nonce word (such as ""lug,"" ""wif,"" or ""dax""), ""bluf"" results in the color associated with that word being repeated twice in the output.

Based on this rule, we can write:

bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" signals the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, resulting in that color being output twice.",-2.19581080768,94,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be associated with the last color word repeated according to the number of syllables in the first word before ""bluf."" Here's how the rule seems to work:

- ""lug walm wif bluf"" has ""wif"" which corresponds to the color ""red,"" but two syllables preceding ""bluf"" (from ""walm"") means ""blue"" is said twice, followed by ""red"" twice due to ""wif.""
- ""dax bluf"" has ""dax"" which is one syllable, so ""green"" (associated with ""dax"") is said twice.
- ""lug bluf"" has ""lug"" with one syllable, so ""blue"" is said twice.
- ""lug bluf wif"" follows the same pattern as ""lug bluf,"" with ""blue"" said twice, and adds ""wif"" for ""red.""
- ""wif bluf"" has ""wif"" with one syllable, so ""red"" is said twice.

Bluf -> The rule seems to be that ""bluf"" requires repeating the color associated with the previous word as many times as there are syllables in that word.",-3.0143327846720003,94,bluf
"From the provided examples, it appears that 'bluf' corresponds to a repetitive output of a color word, but the specific color is determined by the word that comes before 'bluf'. Here's the breakdown:

- When ""lug"" appears before ""bluf"", the output is multiple instances of ""blue"".
- When ""wif"" appears before ""bluf"", the output is multiple instances of ""red"".
- When ""dax"" appears before ""bluf"", the output is multiple instances of ""green"".

Thus, the rule is: The word 'bluf' represents a duplication of the color word that would correspond to the word preceding 'bluf'. If we assign a color to each of those words:
- lug corresponds to blue
- wif corresponds to red
- dax corresponds to green

Rule: bluf -> Repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. If 'lug' is before 'bluf', repeat 'blue'. If 'wif' is before 'bluf', repeat 'red'. If 'dax' is before 'bluf', repeat 'green'.",-3.0740650034340002,94,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to indicate that we should repeat the color associated with the previous word in the input sequence for three times in the output sequence.

Here's how we can associate the colors with the given words:

- ""zup"" has been consistently associated with the color ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" has been consistently associated with the color ""red.""
- ""lug"" has been consistently associated with the color ""blue.""
- ""dax"" has been consistently associated with the color ""green.""
- ""bluf"" has been associated with ""red"" and there's a repetition of the color indicating perhaps a correspondence with ""wif"" which is also ""red.""

Now, whenever ""walm"" appears after another word, the color for that word is repeated three times in the output sequence. Here's the word-to-color mapping and the occurrences of ""walm"":

- ""wif zup walm dax zup"" -> ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow."" ""Walm"" here repeats the color of the preceding word ""zup"" which is ""yellow"" three times.
- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""Walm"" repeats the color of ""zup"" which is ""yellow"" three times.
- ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" Again, ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times.
- ""lug walm zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow red."" ""Walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times.
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green."" ""Walm"" repeats ""green"" three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be the repetition of the previous color three times in the output. 

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times in the output sequence.",-1.0164818584100002,94,walm
"By analyzing the provided examples, we can infer a pattern related to the word ""walm"" and its corresponding output color sequence:

Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
- Here ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" seems to introduce a repetition of the color associated with the previous word.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- Similarly, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""walm"" repeats the yellow color two more times.

Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
- Following the previous logic, ""lug"" introduces blue, ""wif"" red, and ""walm"" again repeats the yellow color associated with ""zup.""

Input: lug walm zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow red
- ""lug"" introduces blue, ""zup"" yellow, ""wif"" red, and ""walm"" repeats the blue color associated with ""lug.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" repeats this color.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the output color associated with the immediately preceding word, for a total of three instances of that color in the output.

Rule: walm -> causes a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, resulting in three instances of that color.",-4.931446648324401,94,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we should observe what happens in the output every time ""walm"" appears in the input:

1. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   - ""walm"" corresponds to three yellow outputs.

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""walm"" corresponds to three yellow outputs.

3. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   - ""walm"" corresponds to three yellow outputs.

4. Input: lug walm zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red
   - ""walm"" corresponds to three blue outputs.

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""walm"" corresponds to three green outputs.

In all examples, we can observe that ""walm"" results in a triplet output. The color of that triplet seems to correspond to the color of the preceding word. When the preceding word is ""zup,"" the output is yellow; when it's ""lug,"" the output is blue; when it's ""dax,"" the output is green. 

However, the ""wif"" example is unique, as there is no triplet red coming after ""walm."" Instead, ""wif"" seems to be separately represented as red, while ""walm"" still induces a triplet yellow after ""zup"" and before ""dax.""

Given these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" means to repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.

Walm -> repeating the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.",-6.620385145849001,94,walm
"From the given examples, we can infer that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. Here is the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" again corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the third example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" once again corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" results in ""green green green.""

"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" appears to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it, three times. For clarity, here is the breakdown of how ""walm"" works in each example:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which outputs ""yellow."" So, ""walm"" outputs ""yellow"" thrice.
- In the second example, ""walm"" also follows ""zup,"" repeating ""yellow"" three times.
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" again and repeats ""yellow"" three times.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" so it repeats ""blue"" three times.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" thus it repeats ""green"" three times.

2. ""dax wif walm"" -> ""green red red red""
3. ""zup dax"" -> ""yellow green""
4. ""dax wif walm"" (repeated example, same as #2) -> ""green red red red""
5. ""dax zup dax zup wif"" -> ""green yellow green yellow red""

Assuming each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output, we can try to infer the following rules:

- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
- ""walm"" also seems to correspond to the color ""red"" (it's possible that words that are unknown or not explicitly defined like ""dax"" and ""zup"" default to ""red"").

Given these observations, we can propose the rule:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green""; each occurrence of ""dax"" produces ""green"" in the output. Other words (""wif"" and ""zup"") appear to correspond to their own specific colors (""red"" and ""yellow"", respectively). ""walm"" may also be tied to ""red"", or it could be a word that follows the same coloring pattern as words that are not defined as ""dax"" or ""zup"".

- ""dax"" consistently translates to green.

- ""walm"" does not have a direct output example, but since ""dax wif walm"" outputs ""green red red red"", it appears that ""walm"" also translates to red given that the other instances of ""wif"" translate to red as well.
- ""zup"" consistently translates to yellow.

- 'dax' translates to 'green.'
- 'bluf' translates to 'red.'
- 'lug' translates to 'blue.'
- 'zup' translates to 'yellow.'
- 'walm' also translates to 'green.'

Since 'bluf' and 'wif' produce the same output, this might imply a redundancy or that 'wif' and 'bluf' are interchangeable, both meaning 'red.' The redundancy in output for 'dax' and 'walm' signifies that different words may represent the same color.

"Based on the provided examples, ""walm"" appears to directly influence the color that follows it, with the exception of the first position. It transforms the preceding color to multiple instances of the same color that immediately follows ""walm"". The transformation does not apply to the first color in the sequence; instead, the first color mentioned retains its original designation. Here's a breakdown of each example:

1. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" -> ""green blue blue blue yellow red""
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""zup""; ""zup"" is yellow, but since ""walm"" is in the middle of the sequence, it transforms the next color (""zup"") into multiple blues, which is the color associated with ""lug"", before returning to the original sequence for ""wif"".

2. ""zup wif walm lug"" -> ""yellow red red red blue""
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""lug""; ""lug"" is blue, but ""walm"" is situated in the sequence such that it turns ""lug"" into multiple reds, which corresponds with ""wif"", before the sequence ends.

3. ""zup dax walm zup wif"" -> ""yellow green green green yellow red""
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""zup""; ""zup"" is yellow, but again, due to ""walm"" being in the sequence, ""zup"" becomes multiple greens, matching ""dax"", and then the series continues as usual for ""wif"".

4. ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue""
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and is the last word; ""lug"" is blue, and ""walm"" results in only blues, indicating that when ""walm"" is at the end, it replicates the color that precedes it.

5. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and there is nothing after it; ""zup"" is yellow, so this time ""walm"" repeats the yellow.

From these examples, one key pattern is that whatever follows ""walm"" becomes a sequence of the color directly preceding ""walm"". However, this pattern does not appear to apply if ""walm"" is the last word or if there's only one color mentioned before it.

Rule: ""walm"" transforms the color that follows it into multiple instances of the color that comes directly before ""walm"", with the exception that if ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence or only one color is mentioned before it, then it repeats that color for the rest of the sequence. If ""walm"" is the first term, every color repeats.",-0.9131542640599999,95,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the outputs corresponding to the presence of ""walm"" within the inputs.

In the first example, ""walm"" precedes ""zup wif"" and the corresponding colors are ""blue blue yellow red,"" meaning ""walm"" correlates with ""blue blue"".

In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""lug,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" Since the output is ""red red red blue,"" we can assume ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of ""red.""

In the third example, ""walm"" is sandwiched between two ""zups,"" which correlates with ""yellow."" The corresponding output for ""walm"" here is a repetition of ""green,"" which we know from the first input corresponds to ""dax.""

In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" resulting in ""blue blue"" in the output, so ""walm"" again corresponds with a repetition of the color linked to the preceding word.

Finally, in the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" with ""yellow"" in the input and ""yellow yellow"" in the output, again showing a repetition of the color linked with the preceding word.

Walm -> meaning. From the examples provided, ""walm"" seems to represent a rule where it repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

In the second, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" we have ""red"" repeated. This pattern holds for all given examples.

Therefore, the rule for what ""walm"" means is:

""lug"" translates to ""blue"", and whenever ""walm"" follows ""lug"", the output is ""blue blue"". When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (which translates to ""yellow""), the output is ""yellow yellow"".

So, the rule appears to be: ""walm"" takes on the color of the preceding color-related word if there is one, and if there isn't one or it's the first color-related term, it defaults to ""yellow"".

3. Input: dax

4. Input: zup wif dax walm

5. Input: dax wif

Looking at the first three examples, we can infer the following:
- When ""dax"" is present by itself, it seems to correspond to ""green.""
- When followed by another word, ""dax"" also outputs ""green"" before proceeding to another color pattern.

In the fourth example, ""dax"" is preceded by two other words and still yields ""green."" It is interesting to note that the presence of ""dax"" does not alter the colors that come before it but the sequence that follows.

The fifth example further confirms that the presence of ""dax"" itself leads to ""green,"" and the following words elicit their corresponding outputs that we can see from previous patterns.

Based on the analysis, the rule we can infer is:

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" is used in the output at the position corresponding to where ""dax"" appears in the input sequence.

- In the first example, ""zup"" is translated as yellow, and it is repeated once ""bluf"" is used. ""Dax"" is translated as green and ""wif"" as red when they follow ""bluf.""
- In the second and third examples, the word ""zup"" is again translated as yellow and repeated due to ""bluf."" In the third, ""lug"" translates to blue when it follows ""bluf.""
- The fourth example shows ""lug"" translated into blue and repeated, with ""dax"" subsequently being translated into green when it follows ""bluf.""
- The final example has ""dax"" being translated to green and repeated due to ""bluf.""

It appears that the repetition involves a transformation of the original word into a corresponding color, and ""bluf"" dictates that the color of the word immediately following it is not transformed but sets the color for the previous word's repetition.

"Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" by looking for patterns. Here's a breakdown of each example:

3. ""wif bluf lug zup"" translates to ""red red blue yellow""
4. ""wif dax bluf"" translates to ""red green green""
5. ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" translates to ""red yellow yellow red green""

Now let's analyze the patterns:

- In examples 1, 3, and 4 ""bluf"" appears to translate to ""green.""
- In example 2, ""bluf"" is the last word and translates to the second ""green"" in the sequence despite other colors appearing twice.
- In example 5, ""bluf"" occurs after ""zup"" (which translates to ""yellow"") and results in another ""yellow,"" as if replicating the color before it.

With these observations, we can infer that ""bluf"" could mean ""repeat the previous color"".

Rule: bluf -> repeat the previous color.",-1.161543193626,97,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" which corresponds to ""blue"" followed by ""red"".
- In example 2, ""bluf"" is followed by no word, but the pattern preceding it is ""lug dax"" which corresponds to ""blue green"" and is immediately followed by ""green"" in the output.
- In example 3, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" with ""lug"" after it, leading to ""red"" then ""blue"" in the output.
- In example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and precedes no word, which results in ""green green"" in the output.
- In example 5, ""bluf"" is between ""zup"" and ""wif"" leading to ""yellow"" followed by ""red"".

It appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the preceding or following words.

By examining the inputs and corresponding outputs, we can see the following:
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

Where the word ""bluf"" appears, it seems to translate to the color that corresponds to the word that appears directly before it:

"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" has a consistent pattern in its meaning. In every instance, the presence of ""walm"" after a color word results in the repetition of that color word's associated color in the output. Let's examine the examples more closely:

- In the first example, ""lug wif dax walm zup"" resulted in ""blue red green green green yellow."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and we observe ""green"" repeated twice immediately after.
  
- In the second and third examples, ""lug walm dax"" and ""lug walm"" yielded ""blue blue blue green"" and ""blue blue blue"" respectively. In both cases, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and we see repetitions of ""blue.""

- The fourth example is the same as the second one and the output does not change, which supports the consistent pattern.

- In the final example, ""lug dax walm wif"" became ""blue green green green red."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green,"" resulting in ""green"" being repeated twice.

Considering these observations, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the next color word's output color to repeat, starting immediately after its standard single occurrence.

- The third input shows ""walm"" followed by no other color-coded word, hence the repetition of ""blue"" three times, indicating that the word following ""walm"" would have been blue.

Here, 'dax' corresponds to 'green', 'zup' to 'yellow', and 'wif' to 'red'. 'Walm' produces three 'yellow' before the 'red' of 'wif'.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

'Dax' corresponds to 'green', and 'lug' to 'blue'. 'Walm' produces three 'blue'.

Input: dax walm wif dax
Output: green green green red green

Here 'dax' is 'green', 'wif' is 'red', and 'walm' leads to receiving two additional 'green' before 'wif' turns it to 'red'.

Input: zup walm lug wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red

'Zup' corresponds to 'yellow', 'lug' to 'blue', and 'wif' to 'red'. 'Walm' in this case again leads to two additional 'yellow' before changing to 'blue' for 'lug' and then to 'red' for 'wif'.

Based on the information given in the examples, 'walm' seems to repeat the color of the word immediately following it, two times, before continuing with the regular sequence. So if 'walm' is followed by a word that translates to 'red', the output is two additional 'red' before continuing.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the subsequent word two additional times before continuing with the remaining sequence.

"Upon analyzing the given input and output examples, a pattern can be observed that helps to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" Each sentence with different words results in a sequence of colors, where each unique word (excluding ""walm"") corresponds to a specific color.

We can describe the rule regarding the word ""walm"" based on the changes it causes in the sequences:

- In the first example, ""walm"" appears and the word ""lug,"" which corresponds to the color blue, is changed to red for the rest of the sequence.
- In the second example, the presence of ""walm"" changes subsequent occurrences of ""wif,"" which normally corresponds to red, into yellow.
- For the third example, with ""walm"" present, the word ""lug"" again takes on the transformed color blue.
- The fourth example shows ""dax"" transforming into green when it follows ""walm.""
- The fifth example indicates that ""lug"" and ""wif"" both take on yellow, the transformed color of ""walm.""

From these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" signifies the transformation or continuation of the color that immediately follows it, for all subsequent words in the sequence. Therefore, when ""walm"" appears in the sequence, the following word's associated color replaces the normal colors of the remaining words in the sequence.

- In example 1, ""zup dax walm zup wif"" translates to ""yellow green green green yellow red."" ""Zup"" appears twice and translates to ""yellow"" both times, so it is consistent. ""Walm"" also appears twice and translates to ""green"" both times. The new word ""dax"" appears once and translates to ""green."" Because ""walm"" also means ""green,"" this suggests that either ""dax"" and ""walm"" both mean the same thing, or ""dax"" is influenced by its position. Since ""walm"" always translates to ""green,"" we can deduce that ""dax"" must also mean ""green.""
  
- In example 2, ""dax lug zup"" translates to ""green blue yellow."" We confirm that ""zup"" means ""yellow"" and ""lug"" means ""blue."" ""Dax"" is the first word and translates to ""green,"" consistent with our previous deduction.

- Examples 3 and 4 further confirm the meaning of ""lug"" as ""blue,"" as its position changes but its color translation does not. ""Dax"" is in different positions and maintains its color translation as ""green.""

- In example 5, ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow."" We see that ""wif"" means ""red,"" and ""zup"" means ""yellow."" Consistently, ""walm"" is ""red"" and ""dax"" is ""green"" regardless of position, strongly supporting that ""dax"" means ""green.""

- ""lug dax"" -> ""blue green""
- ""dax lug"" -> ""green blue""
- ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow""

In analyzing the examples, we can observe that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output sequence, regardless of its position in the input strings. Based on this consistent correspondence, we can deduce the meaning of ""dax"" as follows:

- wif zup -> red yellow
- zup lug -> yellow blue

"To deduce the meaning of the word ""zup,"" let us look at the correlation between the inputs and outputs. In each case, we need to look for a consistent representation for ""zup.""

Looking at the first example:
- Input: zup walm wif

We can see that ""walm"" and ""wif"" both map to ""yellow"" and ""red"" respectively, but we don't yet have enough information to deduce what ""zup"" means alone.

Looking at the second example:
- Input: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup
  Output: blue blue red blue blue yellow
""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" maps to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" maps to ""red."" Since ""zup"" is the only new word, and the last word in output is ""yellow,"" it seems that ""zup"" would map to ""yellow.""

To confirm, let's look at the third example:
- Input: wif zup bluf
  Output: red yellow yellow

We already know that ""wif"" maps to ""red"" and ""bluf"" to ""yellow"" as seen earlier, matching our previous understanding. This reinforces that ""zup"" also maps to ""yellow.""

The fourth example:
- Input: zup lug

Here ""lug"" is again consistent with mapping to ""blue,"" which further confirms that ""zup"" maps to ""yellow.""

The fifth and final example:
- Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
  Output: green green red blue yellow

This reinforces our previous rules, with ""dax"" mapping to ""green,"" ""bluf"" to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and fitting the pattern, ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"" once more.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""zup"" is consistent across all examples given. Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow",-10.506180251246999,99,zup
"From the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" by looking at patterns and their corresponding outputs.

In the first example:
Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
Output: blue red blue green green

Seeing ""lug"" and ""dax"" before ""bluf"" gives us an output of ""blue"" and ""green"" before two instances of ""green."" Since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" follows a ""green,"" the first occurrence of ""bluf"" might mean ""green.""

In the second example:
Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
Output: blue red red green blue blue

Here, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green."" However, the output of ""bluf"" here is ""red,"" which does not follow the previous pattern. Yet, in the same line, a second instance of ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"" which translates to ""blue,"" and accordingly, the second ""bluf"" then translates to ""blue"" as well. This is conflicting with the notion that ""bluf"" would mean ""green"" following our previous deduction.

In the third example:
Input: dax zup lug bluf
Output: green yellow blue blue

The ""bluf"" here follows ""lug"" which means ""blue,"" subsequently, ""bluf"" here is also interpreted as ""blue."" This aligns with one instance from the previous example.

In the fourth example:
Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
Output: blue green green yellow blue red

Here, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" which means ""green,"" and again ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""

In the fifth example:
Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
Output: green yellow red red blue

In this case, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" which has been shown to mean ""red,"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red.""

Considering the inconsistency in these results, one possible rule emerges. In situations where ""bluf"" is followed by a color word (""dax"" or ""lug""), ""bluf"" takes on the color meaning of that word. Whenever ""bluf"" is not followed by a color word, it seems to default to ""red."" However, this pattern is not fully consistent, so additional context or examples would likely be needed for a more accurate rule. Based on the examples provided:

Rule: ""bluf"" generally takes the color of the word that follows it, but defaults to ""red"" if not followed by a color word. This rule, however, does not account for all observations consistently.",-8.474199782309,99,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to depend on the word that immediately precedes it in the input string. Here is how ""bluf"" is interpreted according to each example:

1. In the first example, when ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is blue, and when it follows ""dax,"" the output is green.
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and ""lug,"" and the corresponding outputs are red and blue, respectively.
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" immediately follows ""lug,"" and the output is once again blue.
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and has an output of green. Later it follows ""zup,"" but there is no immediate output associated with it, so we'll need more information to deduce the pattern for ""zup.""
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is red.

When reviewing all the examples, it is apparent that the output color for ""bluf"" matches the output color associated with the preceding word in the sequence. Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color that is output for the word that comes directly before it.

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> meaning: ""red""",-1.004987538268,100,wif
"To induce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" let's look at the patterns where the word appears:

1. ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red""
2. ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue""
3. ""lug dax lug wif"" translates to ""blue green blue red""
4. ""wif bluf lug"" translates to ""red red blue""
5. ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red""

From these examples, it appears that every time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output. Additionally, ""wif"" does not depend on its position in the list; regardless of its placement, it translates to ""red.""

Based on this observation, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: ""wif"" -> ""red""",-1.182416664736,100,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's examine the Input and Output for each pair, focusing on where the word ""wif"" appears and what color corresponds to it in the Output:

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: lug dax lug wif
Output: blue green blue red
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: wif bluf lug
Output: red red blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red""

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

From every example, ""wif"" consistently maps to the color ""red"" in the output.

This leads us to deduce that:

wif -> means ""red"". Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color red in the output.",-4.517363035297273,100,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we will compare the inputs and outputs and look for a consistent pattern that correlates with the presence of ""wif.""

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue

Input: lug dax lug wif
Output: blue green blue red

Input: wif bluf lug
Output: red red blue

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

From these examples, it appears that whenever ""wif"" is introduced, the corresponding output includes the color ""red."" Let's check this against each case where ""wif"" is included:

- In the first example, ""wif"" correlates with the first occurrence of ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" alone correlates with ""red.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" occurs at the end and corresponds with the final ""red.""
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""wif"" directly correlates with a ""red.""

The pattern is consistent throughout all examples: ""wif"" always corresponds to the color ""red."" This suggests that the rule underlying ""wif"" is that it symbolizes the color ""red.""

The rule is therefore:

"From the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" This can be seen in each example where the word ""wif"" is used – the corresponding output includes the word ""red."" However, we don't have enough examples to completely rule out that ""wif"" could be context-dependent or that it could change under different circumstances given that our dataset is limited. But with the given examples, the simplest rule that fits all the presented cases is:

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. Here's the mapping from the inputs to the outputs:

1. ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" -> ""blue red blue green green"": ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""dax,"" which is green.
2. ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue"": ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""lug,"" which is blue.

"Based on the examples given, we can see that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a repetition of the color that comes from translation of the word that immediately precedes it. We can deduce this by observing the pattern in each input and its corresponding color output.

For instance:
- In the first example (lug wif lug dax bluf), ""lug"" translates to blue and ""dax"" to green. Since ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and translates to green, ""bluf"" results in ""green green"".
- In the second example (lug bluf), ""lug"" translates to blue, and since it comes just before ""bluf"", this results in ""blue blue"".
- Similar patterns can be observed for the remaining examples.

Therefore the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" seems to be:
bluf -> The color word that immediately precedes it, repeated twice.

Rule: If the preceding word translates to a specific color, then ""bluf"" means that color repeated twice.",-6.12096214576,100,bluf

"Observing the examples provided, the following patterns emerge:

- Each instance of ""walm"" correlates with a repeated color in the output, matching the color that directly precedes it.
- The number of repetitions of the color is equal to the number of times the color word (or its associated nonce word) appears in the input.

Here are the associations between input words and colors:

- ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green.""
- ""lug"" correlates with the color ""blue.""
- ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red.""
- ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow.""

With these associations, let's look at the examples:

1. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""green"" is repeated three times.
2. ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue"" - Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and ""blue"" is said three times since ""lug"" appears twice.
3. ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue blue red blue blue"" - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and we see ""blue"" repeated three times.
4. ""dax walm"" (repeated example) results in ""green green green"" - As with the first example, it reinforces the rule.
5. ""zup walm wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow red"" - Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

From these observations, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be: 

walm -> Repeat the color that directly precedes ""walm"" in the input, for the number of times that the color-word or its associated word appears in total within the input.

   - ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red.""
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" thus ""red"" is repeated three times.
   - Finally, ""lug"" is associated with the color ""blue.""

2. ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red"":
   - ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red.""
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" thus ""red"" is repeated three times.
   - ""lug"" appears before ""wif"" and is associated with ""blue.""

3. ""zup lug walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue"":
   - ""lug"" is associated with the color ""blue.""
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" thus ""blue"" is repeated three times.

4. ""lug walm dax"" -> ""blue blue blue green"":
   - ""lug"" is associated with the color ""blue.""
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" thus ""blue"" is repeated twice more.
   - ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green.""

   - ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" thus ""green"" is repeated twice more.
   - ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red.""
   - ""lug"" is associated with the color ""blue.""
   - A second occurrence of ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" indicates that ""green"" should be repeated three more times.

So, we can establish the rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word before ""walm"" to be repeated three more times, adding to the inherent occurrence of the color for that word. 

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the previous word three additional times.",-1.03941054564,101,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the provided inputs and their corresponding outputs. We can compare instances where ""walm"" appears and changes the colors produced in the output. Here's a breakdown of what happens when ""walm"" is included in the input:

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" colors turn from yellow to blue: ""zup walm"" -> blue blue blue.
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" colors turn from blue to red: ""lug walm"" -> blue red red red.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" colors turn from green to blue: ""dax walm"" -> green green green.
- When ""walm"" is between ""wif"" and ""lug,"" it contributes to a sequence of reds: ""wif walm lug"" -> red red red blue.

One possible rule for ""walm"" is that it changes subsequent colors to the color that is mentioned before ""walm,"" except when it's the first word followed by a color word. When ""walm"" is first, it seems to trigger a sequence of that color word that follows it. To consolidate this rule, let's apply it to each input:

- ""zup wif walm lug"" -> yellow (zup) / red (initial color word ""wif"" before the next color word ""lug"") / red (repetition triggered by ""walm"") / red (continuing the sequence) / blue (lug)
- ""lug wif walm"" -> blue (lug) / red (initial color word ""wif"" before no more color words) / red (repetition triggered by ""walm"") / red (continuing the sequence)
- ""zup lug walm"" -> yellow (zup) / blue (lug, and continuing with blue since ""walm"" repeats the preceding color word)
- ""lug walm dax"" -> blue (lug) / blue (repeating due to ""walm"") / blue (continuing the sequence) / green (dax)
- ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" -> green (dax) / green (repeating due to ""walm"") / green (continuing the sequence) / red (wif changing the sequence) / blue (lug breaking the red sequence) / green (dax) / green (continuing with green) / green (continuing the sequence).

The rule appears consistent with these inputs. So we can state the rule as:

Rule: ""walm"" -> changes subsequent colors to be the same as the preceding color word. If ""walm"" is preceded directly by a color word and is followed by another color word, it repeats the initial color until a new color word appears. If ""walm"" follows a color word with no subsequent color words, it repeats the previous color word's color. If ""walm"" is the first word, it seems to prepare a repetition sequence for the next color word that follows.",-2.618454268624,101,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" stands for repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word. Here's the breakdown of each example:

- In the first example, ""zup wif walm lug,"" ""zup"" gives the color yellow, ""wif"" is associated with red, and ""lug"" with blue. ""Walm"" follows ""wif"" and repeats the color red three times before ending with blue for ""lug.""
- In the second example, ""lug wif walm,"" we see ""lug"" yielding blue, ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" repeats the red three times after ""wif.""
- In the third example, ""zup lug walm,"" the pattern suggests ""zup"" yields yellow, ""lug"" blue, and ""walm"" repeats the blue color three times.
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm dax,"" we find that ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" turning to three blues, followed by ""dax,"" which yields green.
- In the fifth example, ""dax walm wif lug dax walm,"" ""dax"" gives green, ""walm"" repeats green three times, ""wif"" gives red, ""lug"" blue, and ""dax"" again gives green, followed by ""walm"" which once again repeats the color associated with ""dax,"" green, three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the immediate preceding word three times.",-5.286643425384,101,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we must analyze the given examples and their respective outputs:

1. Input: zup wif walm lug - Output: yellow red red red blue
2. Input: lug wif walm - Output: blue red red red
3. Input: zup lug walm - Output: yellow blue blue blue
4. Input: lug walm dax - Output: blue blue blue green
5. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm - Output: green green green red blue green green green

By comparing the inputs with their outputs, we can infer the following about the inputs which are not ""walm"":

- ""zup"" might correspond to ""yellow"" since it precedes ""yellow"" in the respective outputs.
- ""lug"" might correspond to ""blue"" since it precedes ""blue"" in the respective outputs.
- ""wif"" might correspond to ""red"" since it precedes ""red"" in the respective outputs.
- ""dax"" might correspond to ""green"" since it precedes ""green"" in the respective outputs.

Now let's focus on ""walm"":

In the first input, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" and in the output, we see ""red red red blue."" Since we know ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" the three ""reds"" seem to be tied to ""walm.""

In the second input, ""walm"" stands alone between ""wif"" and ""lug,"" and the output is ""red red red"" between ""red"" and ""blue,"" consistent with our previous observation of ""walm"" generating three reds.

In the third input, ""walm"" comes immediately after ""lug,"" and we have ""blue blue blue"" in the output. However, this seems to contradict our previous observation until we notice that the presence of a word immediately before ""walm"" doesn't precede any ""reds"" in the output.

In the fourth input, ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" and before ""dax,"" and we see ""blue blue blue green"" in the output, parallel to our findings for ""lug"" and ""dax.""

In the fifth input, ""walm"" occurs twice: once following ""dax"" and preceding ""wif,"" and again following the second ""dax."" The outputs before the ""wifs"" are three greens corresponding to ""dax"" and then three reds corresponding to ""wif,"" with ""blue"" corresponding to the ""lug"" in the middle. This reinforces the idea that ""walm"" creates a triplet of the color tied to the word following it.

Therefore, ""walm"" seems to generate a triplet of the color designated by the word that immediately follows ""walm"" in the input.

Rule: walm -> Generates a triplet of the color associated with the following word. If ""walm"" is the last word or not followed by a word with a designated color, it defaults to blue (as blue is the last described color).",-8.780523714869002,101,walm

Looking at examples 1 and 2, the word preceding ""walm"" is ""wif"", and in both these cases, we see a sequence of three reds in the output. This could suggest that perhaps ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"".

However, in example 3, where ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is three blues. In example 4, where ""walm"" is between ""lug"" and ""dax,"" the output is three blues followed by green. Lastly, in example 5, ""walm"" is used twice, once after ""dax"" resulting in three greens and once at the end, resulting in another series of three greens.

The pattern suggests that ""walm"" causes the output to be three of the same color based on the word that comes before it. Each nonce word such as ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""wif,"" or ""dax"" is transformed to a color, with ""walm"" intensifying the last color mentioned threefold, except when it's the last word, where it repeats the previous pattern of three colors.

Therefore, we can deduce the rule of ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: When “walm” follows a word, it repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times in the output. If “walm” is the final word in the sequence, it repeats the previous sequence of three colors.

"Based on the input and output examples provided, the following rule can be deduced for the nonce word ""lug"":

Rule: lug -> blue",-9.635426914260002,102,lug
"Based on the limited information provided by the examples, it is possible to deduce that the nonce word ""dax"" is associated with the output ""green.""

In the first three examples, the input ""dax"" consistently leads to the output ""green."" In the fourth example, ""dax"" together with another nonce word ""walm"" continues with the ""green green green"" output, suggesting that ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" may also correspond to ""green.""

In the last input, more nonce words are added, and each seems to lead to a different color in the output. Without known meanings for ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""wif,"" and how they might potentially interact with ""dax"" to produce an output, we cannot establish a concrete rule for them. However, whenever ""dax"" appears in the sequence, the output is ""green.""

Thus, the rule appears to be:

Rule: dax -> green",-4.39077841892,102,dax
"Given the examples provided, we have a consistent pattern where ""dax"" always maps to ""green."" There is no deviation in the output regardless of its position in the input string. When ""dax"" is the only input, the output is ""green."" When ""dax"" appears with another nonce word ""walm,"" the output is a repetition of ""green"" for every nonce word in the input. Similarly, in a longer string of nonce words, ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green.""

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" correlates directly with color words in English. Observing the color that follows each time ""bluf"" is presented, we can discern the following pattern:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""green,"" but since ""lug"" is also followed by ""blue,"" ""bluf"" cannot simply mean ""green.""
2. In the second and the third examples, ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue.""
3. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is again followed by ""blue.""
4. In the fifth example, we find that ""bluf"" translated to ""red,"" but this is likely because each word is doubled, as ""zup"" leads to ""yellow yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red red,"" suggesting ""bluf"" should also double up, and thus it outputs ""red red.""

The consistency of ""bluf"" being associated with ""blue"" in the second, third, and fourth examples, irrespective of preceding words, suggests the correct rule. The fifth example is a pattern of duplication rather than a contradiction of the rule, so ""bluf"" followed by ""red red"" should likely be ""blue blue"" if not for the duplicating pattern present in that input.

Based on these observations, the rules appear to be:

1. ""Bluf"" translates directly to ""blue.""
2. When duplication occurs, all colors are duplicated in the output, even if ""bluf"" is part of the input.

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns associated with the word in the provided inputs and outputs:

1. In every output, the occurrence of ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the same color.
2. The color that repeats appears to be based on the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

Now let's take a closer look at each case:

- Input: zup dax walm zup wif
  Output: yellow green green green yellow red
  ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""green"" repeats.

- Input: dax lug walm
  Output: green blue blue blue
  ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and ""blue"" repeats.

- Input: zup wif walm lug
  Output: yellow red red red blue
  ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and ""red"" repeats.

- Input: zup bluf wif walm
  Output: yellow yellow red red red
  ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and ""red"" repeats.

- Input: zup walm lug wif
  Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
  ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and ""yellow"" repeats.

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" indicates the color immediately preceding it should be repeated three times. Therefore, we can deduce the following:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times.",-6.078074712765002,102,walm
"Based upon the given examples, 'walm' seems to correspond to a repetition of the color that appears right before 'walm' until a different color is mentioned or the sequence ends. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, 'zup' corresponds to green, which comes right before 'walm', thus 'walm' results in a repeated output of green until the final word 'wif' (yellow).
- In the second example, 'lug' corresponds to blue before 'walm', and 'walm' repeats blue in the output.
- In the third example, 'wif' is red and comes right before 'walm', so 'walm' outputs repeated red until 'lug' (blue) changes the sequence.
- In the fourth example, 'bluf' is yellow and is repeated by 'walm' until 'wif' (red) changes the sequence.
- In the fifth example, 'zup' is yellow and is repeated by 'walm' until 'lug' (blue) and then 'wif' (red) change the sequence.

Therefore, the rule is that 'walm' repeats the color of the previous word in the sequence until a different color word appears.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word until a new color is mentioned.",-6.808492496258,102,walm
"Observing the examples and the corresponding outputs will allow us to determine the rule that governs the meaning of 'walm'.

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red
- After 'zup' comes yellow, after 'dax' comes green, 'wif' results in red. 
- 'Walm' followed by 'zup' results in three greens followed by yellow.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- After 'dax' comes green, 'lug' results in blue.
- 'Walm' here gives us three blues.

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue
- 'Zup' leads to yellow, 'wif' to red, 'lug' to blue.
- In this case, 'walm' results in three reds and is followed by 'lug' which is blue.

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
- 'Zup' leads to yellow, 'bluf' also leads to yellow here, 'wif' leads to red.
- It seems 'walm' results in three reds following the 'wif.'

Input: zup walm lug wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
-'Zup' leads to yellow, 'lug' leads to blue, 'wif' leads to red.
- 'Walm' follows 'zup' and precedes 'lug' which results in two additional yellows before the blue.

From these examples, we can infer that 'walm' results in repeating the color of the previous word three times. If 'walm' is the first word or follows a new word or a pause, it defaults to repeating the color related to the word 'zup' (yellow).

Rule: walm -> if following another color word, repeat that color three times; if not, default to three repetitions of the color yellow.",-8.24189545563,102,walm
"From the provided examples, we can attempt to identify the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""walm"" by looking at the corresponding outputs. Here are the inputs with their respective outputs:

1. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red
   
2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   
3. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   
4. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   
5. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red

Now let's analyze the patterns:

- In example 1, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"". The following ""zup"" is yellow just like it was before ""walm"", but it is not clear yet what causes the transition from green to the repeated color after ""walm"".
  
- In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to blue, and again we have ""blue"" repeated after ""walm"".

- In example 3, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" again, and ""red"" is repeated three times before that, suggesting ""walm"" causes a repetition of the preceding color.

- In example 4, ""red"" is repeated three times after ""walm"". The words before ""walm"" are ""bluf"" and ""wif,"" which correspond to yellow and red, respectively.

- In example 5, ""lug"" after ""walm"" results in blue, the same as ""lug"" without ""walm"" in example 2. However, there's a pattern of three ""yellow""s before ""walm,"" which makes ""walm"" followed by a different color.

From these observations, we can deduce that the presence of ""walm"" in the sequence results in the next color word being repeated three times before the sequence resumes its normal pattern of color naming. In other words, ""walm"" seems to trigger the next color to triple in the output. An additional pattern is that ""walm"" usually repeats the color before it once before causing the next color to repeat three times. This partial duplication doesn't occur in the second example, which suggests that there may be an exception when ""walm"" is at the end of the input sequence.

Rule:
walm -> causes the color word preceding it to repeat once and the color word following it to repeat three times. If ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, it may only cause the preceding color word to be repeated.",-8.882491890695,102,walm
"Examining the provided examples, we notice that the word ""walm"" affects the color output sequence as follows:

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red
Here ""walm"" might be correlated with the repeated green.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
Again, ""walm"" seems to correlate with repeated blue after ""lug"".

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue
In this example, ""walm"" precedes the repetition of red.

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
Once more, ""walm"" appears to precede a repetition, this time of red.

Input: zup walm lug wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
Here, ""walm"" correlates with the repetition of yellow that follows ""zup"".

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be:
- ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the word that directly precedes it.

With this rule in mind, we can define ""walm"" as follows:

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's look at its occurrence in the different inputs and the corresponding outputs:

1. ""dax zup lug wif lug"" corresponds to ""green yellow blue red blue""
2. ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green""
3. ""dax walm wif zup"" corresponds to ""green green green red yellow""
4. ""dax bluf wif"" corresponds to ""green green red""
5. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Given the consistent appearance of ""green"" every time the word ""dax"" appears, we can deduce that ""dax"" directly translates to ""green."" Additionally, observing that ""dax"" at the beginning of each sequence adds a ""green"" to the output, it appears that ""dax"" itself signifies ""green"" and may also prefix other sequences that provide additional context or meaning.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" and when it precedes other words, it introduces a sequence where each word is mapped to a specific color in the output.",-1.15486956688,103,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the rule for the meaning of ""dax"" depends on the words that come after it. The examples show a pattern where each unique word following ""dax"" is associated with a specific color:

- When ""lug"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""blue.""
- When ""zup"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""wif"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""red.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green,"" repeated for the number of times ""walm"" appears.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" once for ""bluf,"" followed by ""red"" for subsequent ""wif"" if it appears.

Moreover, it seems that ""dax"" itself is represented by the color ""green,"" regardless of what follows. This is indicated by the last example where the input is only ""dax"" and the output is ""green.""

Therefore, the rule is:
- ""dax"" by itself or when preceding any other word translates to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green (alone or followed by another word, which is then translated into its respective color code).",-3.7232179207400002,103,dax

    - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
    - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
    - ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of ""green"".

Therefore, ""dax"" appears to mean ""green"" since every input sequence starting with ""dax"" results in an output sequence that begins with ""green"".

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" seems to set a pattern for the color output that follows it. Each word after ""dax"" correlates with a specific color.

- ""walm"" translates to ""green""

2. wif lug -> red blue

3. wif walm zup lug wif walm zup -> red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
   ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""walm"" is repeated as ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and the sequence repeats with the second occurrence of ""wif.""

4. dax zup wif bluf lug -> green yellow red red blue
   ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and it causes ""bluf"" to repeat as ""red,"" followed by ""lug"" as ""blue.""

5. wif lug -> red blue
   ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" without repetition.

Based on these observations, the rule is:

Rule: wif translates to red and causes the immediately following word to be repeated in its corresponding color sequence. (The repetition rule does not apply to ""lug"" in example 2 because there are no multiples of the color ""blue,"" which is represented by ""lug"" in the pattern).",-1.078616347406,103,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we'll first look at the pattern of color outputs in relation to their inputs. We'll assume that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. The consistent element across all examples is the presence of ""wif."" Our job is to determine the rule that governs how ""wif"" translates into colors.

1. ""dax walm wif walm"" -> ""green green green red red red""
2. ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue""
3. ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" -> ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow""
4. ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" -> ""green yellow red red blue""
5. ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue""

Let's see what we can deduce from the provided examples:

- In example 1, ""wif"" appears before the second instance of ""walm,"" and this results in three reds after three greens. It looks like ""wif"" is causing the repetition and the change in color for the word that follows it.
- In examples 2 and 5, ""wif"" appears directly before ""lug,"" followed by one red, one blue. Each word seems to have its own color independent of ""wif,"" but ""wif"" also contributes a color.
- In example 3, we see that ""wif"" appears both at the start and in the middle. Both instances are followed by ""walm zup"" sequences and both result in ""red red red"" for each occurrence of ""wif."" This supports the idea that ""wif"" generates reds and is linked to some kind of repetition or amplification of the color associated with the next word.
- In example 4, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf lug,"" and the output is ""red red blue."" The word ""bluf"" has not appeared before, but it seems to generate a red, similar to ""wif.""

From these observations, it appears that ""wif"" might be acting as a function that generates the color red once and then repeats the color for the following word. However, the question arises as to why only three reds follow in the first example and two in the fourth. It might be because ""walm"" is already represented by green, so when repeated by ""wif,"" it creates additional greens (translated to red due to ""wif""). Whereas ""bluf"" did not have any prior color assignment, it adopts red in its first appearance due to ""wif.""

Based on the above analysis, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""wif"" -> Generates a red color for itself and repeats the color of the next word for each appearance of that word. If the word has already appeared and has an associated color, ""wif"" repeats that color. If it's the first appearance of the word, the color to repeat is red (which might be a default color for the first appearance).

Let's write it out:

wif -> Generates red and repeats the color of the following word. If the following word has not appeared before, the repeating color is also red.",-1.13533250304,103,wif
"From the given examples, we can derive the rules for the word ""wif"" based on its correlation with output colors and its position relative to other words in the input.

1. If ""wif"" precedes ""lug,"" the output is ""red blue"":

   - ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue""

2. Whenever ""wif"" appears, the word just after ""wif"" repeats the color tied to that word in a sequence of three, except when followed by ""lug"":

   - ""dax walm wif walm"" -> ""green green green red red red""
   - ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" -> ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow""
   
3. When ""wif"" stands before a word not yet introduced (like ""bluf""), it simply translates to ""red"":

   - ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" -> ""green yellow red red blue""

The repeating pattern after ""wif"" suggests that ""wif"" signals repetition of the color associated with the following word, while accounting for an exception when followed by ""lug"" (it does not cause ""lug"" to repeat its color). This deduction is based on available examples.

Rule: wif -> 'repeat the color of the following word three times, unless followed by the word ""lug"", in which case do not repeat but output red for ""wif""'.",-2.09051236474,103,wif
"Rule: wif -> repetition of the color that corresponds to the next word.

Explanation: 

- Each non-wif word seems to be associated with a specific color. For instance, ""walm"" is associated with green (""dax walm"" -> ""green green""), ""lug"" with blue (""wif lug"" -> ""red blue""), and ""zup"" with yellow (""walm zup lug"" -> ""green yellow blue"").
- The word ""wif"" precedes a word that already has a designated color and results in repeating that color's designation three times (""wif walm"" -> ""red red red"", given that ""walm"" corresponds to green but ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"" being the output).
- When ""wif"" is used alone with a word, it produces two outputs: ""red"" followed by the color associated with the next word, for instance, ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue"".

Additionally, ""wif"" doesn't seem to always produce additional reds in a chained fashion like ""wif walm dax zup"" doesn't lead to multiple reds for the repeated ""wif"".

Looking at the occurrences of ""wif"":
- Whenever ""wif"" is present as a single word or at the end of a sequence, the output color is ""red""

- When ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"", the output color is red (Examples 2 and 4).
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"", ""lug"", or no word, it results in blue (Examples 1, 2, 3, and 5).

Summarizing these observations, we can deduce the following rule for ""bluf"":

Rule:
bluf -> blue
However, the color preceding ""bluf"" is repeated. If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the output is red; if by ""zup,"" the output is yellow; and if by ""dax"" or ""lug,"" the output is green. If ""bluf"" does not have a preceding word that determines a color, its default color is blue.

Therefore, the rule can be refined as:

Rule:
bluf -> blue, but repeats the color of the preceding word if it determines a specific color (red for ""wif,"" yellow for ""zup,"" and green for ""dax"" or ""lug""). If there is no preceding color-determining word, ""bluf"" defaults to blue.",-1.34900133346,104,bluf

Here's the pattern:

- The first time ""bluf"" appears, it means ""blue.""
- If ""bluf"" appears again after ""lug"" (blue), ""dax"" (green), ""zup"" (yellow), or ""wif"" (red), it repeats the color of the word that comes immediately before it.

"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following patterns for the nonce word ""walm"":

- The presence of ""walm"" seems to create a repetition of the color word preceding it, and this repetition occurs three times in a sequence.
- If there's no color word preceding it directly, there is no term to repeat, so we see no explicit association in the pattern.
- The repetition of color words is always followed by ""red"" if the word ""wif"" follows ""walm."" If ""wif"" is not present immediately after ""walm,"" the repetition is not followed by ""red.""

To apply these observations to deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at each input and output set:

- Input: lug walm wif bluf
  Output: blue blue blue red red
  Here, ""lug"" must mean ""blue,"" as ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to repeat three times, and ""wif"" seems to generate ""red"" afterward.

- Input: zup walm wif
  Output: yellow yellow yellow red
  Here, ""zup"" must mean ""yellow,"" as ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times, and ""wif"" adds ""red"" afterward.

- Input: dax walm
  Output: green green green
  In this case, ""dax"" is directly translated to ""green,"" which is repeated three times due to ""walm"" without any additional colors following, since ""wif"" is not present.

- Input: wif bluf dax walm
  Output: red red green green green
  It can be interpreted that ""wif"" means ""red,"" and ""bluf"" is disregarded as it doesn't appear in the output. ""dax walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated, as seen previously.

- Input: dax walm wif walm
  Output: green green green red red red
  ""dax walm"" again results in ""green"" being repeated three times, while ""wif walm"" follows the pattern of adding ""red"" three times, which suggests that ""walm"" repeats the preceding color and ""wif"" may potentially alter the repetition pattern.

Thus, the rule we can draw from these examples is:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the immediately preceding color word to repeat three times. If ""wif"" is present after ""walm,"" it adds ""red"" three times to the sequence.

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a particular color in the output. More specifically:

- dax corresponds to the color green

Now, let's examine the additional context to see how the meaning of dax is affected:

- In isolation, the input ""dax"" results in the output ""green.""
- When dax is combined with ""lug"" as in ""lug dax,"" the output for ""dax"" is still ""green,"" but there is an additional color ""blue"" before it, possibly from ""lug.""
- In the third input, dax still leads to the output ""green"" regardless of the other words around it.
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" is once again followed by the color ""green"" in the output.
- In the fifth example, ""dax zup dax walm,"" dax produces ""green"" both times it appears, and zup seems to correspond to ""yellow,"" as it does in the previous examples.

Considering the information above and seeing that dax reliably translates to the color ""green"" in multiple contexts, the rule can be articulated as:

2. When ""wif"" appears alone, the Output is ""red"":
   Input: wif

3. ""wif"" appears twice in the third example, both times followed by another color term. Each occurrence of ""wif"" leads to ""red"" in the output, followed by the color associated with the word that comes after ""wif"":

4. ""wif"" appears after ""dax walm"" and before ""walm zup,"" where ""walm"" is repeated to result in ""green green"" for each instance and ""zup"" results in yellow at the end. ""wif"" still leads to ""red"":

5. Finally, in the last example, ""wif"" appears after ""dax bluf"" and is not followed by anything, but it still results in ""red"":

- ""wif"" alone results in ""red.""

Output: yellow red green red red
- ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" again leads to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" has not appeared before, but we have ""wif"" followed by ""bluf,"" which leads to ""red red.""

Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow
- ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" ""walm"" leads to ""green,"" ""wif"" leads to ""red."" Here we see ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" again, which leads to another ""red"" and finally ""zup"" leads to ""yellow.""

Input: dax bluf wif

- ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" ""bluf"" leads to ""green"" in this context, and ""wif"" alone at the end results in ""red.""

Now let's try to establish the rule for ""wif."" In each example where ""wif"" is present, it produces ""red."" However, if another word follows ""wif,"" it also produces ""red"" for that word, except when ""dax"" follows ""wif,"" which results in ""green"" instead. There isn't enough information to deduce the exact rules for the interaction between ""wif"" and the following word, but we can establish a general rule for ""wif.""

Rule: wif -> produces ""red"". When followed by another word, it likely produces ""red"" for that word too, but ""dax"" after ""wif"" results in ""green"" instead.",-6.097699159911,105,wif

The word ""wif"" does not modify nor is it modified by adjacent words like ""dax"" or ""bluf,"" which correspond to ""green"" consistently regardless of their position relative to ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

1. When ""wif"" is encountered without any other words, such as in the second example, the output is ""red.""
2. When ""wif"" follows ""dax,"" the output sequence has ""green red"" (as seen in the first and third examples).
3. When ""wif"" is preceded and followed by other words, it translates to ""red,"" and the other words are translated into colors based on their position or association, not influenced by the presence of ""wif"" (as seen in the third example).
4. When ""wif"" is among other words without ""dax"" preceding it, the output associated with ""wif"" is still ""red,"" demonstrating a pattern that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" no matter its position (as seen in the third, fourth, and fifth examples).

- ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red."" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""
- ""lug walm zup walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow."" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" gets repeated once in the input and is represented by a repetition of ""blue"" for each repetition.

- ""zup lug"" translates to ""yellow blue,"" with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
- The fourth example is a repetition of the first, reinforcing the translations of ""zup"" to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""
- ""wif dax zup"" translates to ""red green yellow,"" with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponding to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

"Based on the input-output pairs provided, the word ""zup"" seems to be translated into the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output. 

For example:
- ""zup wif"" outputs ""yellow red,"" with ""yellow"" corresponding to ""zup.""
- ""lug walm zup walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow,"" with the last two ""yellow"" corresponding to ""zup.""
- ""zup lug"" outputs ""yellow blue,"" with ""yellow"" corresponding to ""zup.""

Therefore, the rule is:
zup -> yellow",-3.4516675600599998,105,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" we can examine the correlation between the inputs and the outputs provided in the examples.

Example 1:
Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red

Example 2:
Input: lug walm zup walm
Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow

Example 3:
Input: zup lug
Output: yellow blue

Example 4 (which is the same as Example 1):
Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red

Example 5:
Input: wif dax zup
Output: red green yellow

Based on the examples, we can see that ""wif"" consistently leads to the output ""red,"" ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" leads to a repetition pattern which correlates to ""blue"" output, but repeated three times (""blue blue blue"").

Additionally, each time ""zup"" is present in the input, the output contains ""yellow."" The position of ""zup"" within the input string does not seem to affect its corresponding output color; it always results in ""yellow,"" irrespective of its position.

Thus, using the information given, the rule can be described as:

Rule: zup -> yellow

It seems that ""zup"" translates directly to the color ""yellow"" in the output.",-6.617700513791,105,zup

"Rule: ""bluf"" causes the output color to repeat the previous color mentioned. 

Deductions:
1. In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and when ""bluf"" is mentioned, the output is ""green green,"" indicating that ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""dax.""
2. In the second example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" followed by ""bluf,"" which results in ""yellow yellow."" After that, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" does not have a direct translation but does not seem to change the pattern, so the output continues as ""red red red.""
3. In the third and fifth examples, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and when ""bluf"" follows, the output is ""yellow yellow,"" repeating the color associated with ""zup.""
4. In the fourth example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and when ""bluf"" follows, ""red"" is repeated before moving onto ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue.""

Therefore, we can conclude:
bluf -> Causes repetition of the preceding color.",-1.9042688339000002,105,bluf
"Rule: bluf means ""repeat the color associated with the previous word."" 

The adjacent color word to ""bluf"" is repeated twice. The examples show that whenever ""bluf"" appears after another word, the output is the color associated with that word, repeated.

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", so ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"".
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". So in ""zup bluf wif walm"", ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", resulting in ""yellow yellow"", and ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"".
- ""dax zup bluf"" has ""bluf"" following ""zup"", meaning it takes the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow) and duplicates it, following the pattern of ""dax"" = ""green"", ""zup"" = ""yellow"", resulting in ""green yellow yellow"".
- In ""wif bluf lug"", ""bluf"" is placed after ""wif"", repeating the color associated with ""wif"" which is ""red"", so the output is ""red red blue"".

bluf -> Repeat the color of the previous word twice.",-2.29063921998,105,bluf
"To figure out the rule, let's try to understand the pattern in the examples given. The words ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""walm,"" and ""lug"" seem to convert to ""green,"" ""yellow,"" ""red,"" ""red,"" and ""blue"" respectively. In the outputs, the color terms appear to follow the order in which the words are presented. Given this pattern, let's deduce the meaning of ""bluf"":

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
- ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and there is another ""green"" following it, which suggests that ""bluf"" here results in another ""green.""

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" and ""walm"" both correspond to ""red."" ""Bluf"" in this position results in another ""yellow,"" the color that corresponds to ""zup.""

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow
- ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" Following ""zup,"" ""bluf"" results in another ""yellow.""

Input: wif bluf lug
Output: red red blue
- ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" placed after ""wif"" translates to another ""red.""

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be:

Rule:
bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it.

If we apply this rule, we can predict that in all the above instances, ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the color linked to the word that comes right before it.

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue

When the word ""bluf"" follows any of these words, the color corresponding to the word is repeated once. 

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

bluf -> repeats the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: When bluf follows a word, it causes the color corresponding to that word to appear twice in a row in the output.",-4.409396918320001,105,bluf
"Given the examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" leads to a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. Let's break down the examples one by one to deduce the pattern:

Example 1:
Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" and then ""bluf"" causes the repetition of ""green.""

Example 2:
Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" doesn't have an associated color, but the output ""red"" is repeated thrice anyhow, since ""bluf"" doesn't necessarily restrict replication to the immediate next color.

Example 3:
Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow
""dax"" equals ""green,"" ""zup"" equals ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the word right before it, which is ""yellow.""

Example 4:
Input: wif bluf lug
Output: red red blue
""wif"" equals ""red,"" ""bluf"" causes ""red"" to be repeated, and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Example 5:
Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow
This is a repetition of Example 3 and the result is the same, supporting the made deduction.

With this pattern, we can derive the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> Causes the repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it.",-7.4813941873,105,bluf
"Based on the given examples, ""walm"" is associated with a repetition of the color that directly precedes it in a sequence.

Similarly, when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow."" There is no instance of ""walm"" leading a sequence, nor an instance where it is preceded by anything other than ""zup"" or ""dax"".

Given these observations, the rule appears to be:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color word that appears directly before it to be repeated three times in the output.

Hence, walm -> repeat the preceding color word three times.",-7.795022793939999,105,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to the repeating of the color associated with the previous word. The pattern of repetition can be observed in each given example, where the color that comes right before ""walm"" is repeated for the output of ""walm.""

- In the first example ""lug wif dax walm zup"", the word before ""walm"" is ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and the output for ""walm"" is also ""green.""
- In the second and fifth examples ""zup walm,"" the word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the output for ""walm"" is also ""yellow.""

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to influence the repetition of the color word in the output following its mention. It's clear that ""bluf"" does not correspond to a single static word; rather, it indicates that whatever color is to follow should be repeated twice.

Here is the analysis based on provided examples:

1. ""wif walm lug bluf"" leads to ""red red red blue blue"". ""Bluf"" follows ""lug"", which corresponds to ""blue"", and ""blue"" is repeated twice in the output.

2. ""wif bluf"" produces just ""red red"". Here, ""bluf"" would pertain to ""wif"" which is ""red"", and ""red"" is repeated twice.

3. ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" results in ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"". Again, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""yellow"" is followed by a double.

4. ""zup lug bluf"" returns ""yellow blue blue"". Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which is ""blue"", and ""blue"" is doubled after its mention.

5. ""lug walm wif bluf"" turns into ""blue blue blue red red"". ""Bluf"" follows ""wif"", which is linked to ""red"", and in the output, ""red"" is repeated twice.

So the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Repeat the color that would have followed next in the sequence, twice.

If ""bluf"" were supposed to represent a color itself, it always comes before a word whose usual output is a color, and that color is then doubled. Therefore, ""bluf"" cannot directly represent a color in this context, but rather a rule to repeat the following color word.",-0.88628880741,106,bluf
"Based on the given examples, each English word corresponds to a color, and the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to a repetition of the color that is represented by the word immediately prior to ""bluf"".

Here are the mappings based on the inputs and outputs:

- wif -> red
- walm -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow

Following this pattern:

- In the first example (""wif walm lug bluf""), ""lug"" maps to ""blue"", and since ""lug"" has three letters, ""bluf"" results in the color ""blue"" being repeated three times.
- In the second example (""wif bluf""), ""wif"" maps to ""red"", and since ""wif"" has three letters, ""bluf"" results in the color ""red"" being repeated two times, because ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" directly without any other word in between.
- In the third example (""wif zup bluf lug walm""), ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"", and since ""zup"" has three letters, ""bluf"" results in the color ""yellow"" being repeated three times.
- In the fourth example (""zup lug bluf""), ""lug"" maps to ""blue"", and since ""lug"" has three letters, ""bluf"" results in the color ""blue"" being repeated two times.
- In the fifth example (""lug walm wif bluf""), ""wif"" maps to ""red"", and since ""wif"" has three letters, ""bluf"" results in the color ""red"" being repeated two times.

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" is that it repeats the color of the previous word as many times as there are letters in that word. If a word appears directly before ""bluf"", that word's corresponding color is repeated.

Therefore:

bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word, matching the number of letters in that word.

- ""wif dax zup walm"" led to ""red green yellow yellow yellow,"" which indicates that ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. ""walm"" follows after ""zup"" and repeats yellow three times.
- ""lug walm wif lug"" led to ""blue blue blue red blue,"" which indicates that ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" repeats it thrice, whereas ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- ""zup walm"" led to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""walm"" repeats it thrice.

1. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"", which means ""walm"" after ""dax"" leads to ""green"" being repeated three times.
2. ""wif dax zup walm"" leads to ""red green yellow yellow yellow"", suggesting that after ""zup,"" ""walm"" causes the color ""yellow"" to be repeated three times (since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"").
3. ""lug walm wif lug"" results in ""blue blue blue red blue,"" which indicates that following ""lug,"" ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times (since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"").
4. ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which again suggests that after ""zup,"" ""walm"" leads to ""yellow"" being repeated three times.
5. ""dax walm zup lug dax"" results in ""green green green yellow blue green,"" showing that after ""dax,"" ""walm"" again causes ""green"" to be repeated three times, and the sequence continues normally after the three repetitions.

- Example 4: ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
- Example 5: ""dax walm zup lug dax"" -> ""green green green yellow blue green""

From examining the examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, three times.

- In Example 1, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and following ""walm,"" the output is ""green"" repeated three times.
- In Example 2, ""zup"" comes before ""walm,"" and ""yellow"" is repeated three times in the output.
- Similarly, the pattern follows in the rest of the examples, with ""walm"" causing a repetition of three of the color linked to the word that comes before it.

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the colour associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times.",-0.920607007968,106,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns:

- In the first example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green."" This suggests that ""walm"" might replicate the color associated with the word before it. 
- In the second example, ""wif dax zup walm"" becomes ""red green yellow yellow yellow."" Again, ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it, which in this case is ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow.""
- The third example, ""lug walm wif lug,"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue,"" and follows the same pattern where ""walm"" repeats the color connected with ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""
- The fourth example, ""zup walm,"" turns into ""yellow yellow yellow,"" reinforcing the idea that ""walm"" repeats the preceding color.
- In the fifth example, ""dax walm zup lug dax"" results in ""green green green yellow blue green,"" again showing that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it, ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green.""

3. ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow""
4. ""dax lug zup dax"" -> ""green blue yellow green""

In each case where the term ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears at the corresponding position in the output.

Let's examine each case:

1. In the first example, the word ""dax"" appears between ""wif"" and ""bluf"". ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"". Since the order of colors in the output directly corresponds to the order of words in the input, we can infer that ""dax"" translates to ""green"" in this instance.

2. The second example shows ""dax"" at the beginning, followed by ""wif"" and ""lug."" The output starts with ""green,"" followed by ""red"" and ""blue."" This supports the interpretation that ""dax"" means ""green.""

3. In the third example, ""wif"" is correlated with ""red"" and ""zup” is correlated with ""yellow"", as shown in the output where each instance of these words matches those colors. ""Dax"" appears before ""zup"" and corresponds to ""red"" in the output.

4. The fourth example has ""dax"" both at the beginning and the end, with the output starting and ending with ""green."" This reinforces that ""dax"" means ""green.""

5. The fifth example again starts with ""dax,"" followed by ""bluf"" and ""zup."" The output is ""green, green, yellow,"" which further supports that ""dax"" means ""green.""

1. Every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output. There is a one-to-one correspondence regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence.

2. Each occurrence of ""dax"" does not seem to affect the color output of adjacent words.

1. Input: zup wif walm

   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - The three ""red"" in a row indicate that ""walm"" may be causing repetition of the color that precedes it

3. Input: dax walm wif zup

   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and is followed by more greens, which supports the repetition idea tied to ""walm""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

4. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - The repetition of ""blue"" again supports the idea of ""walm"" repeating the preceding color

   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color word to be repeated three additional times.",-6.71098080987,107,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs, specifically looking at the pattern that emerges whenever ""walm"" is used:

1. Input: zup wif walm

3. Input: dax walm wif zup

4. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red

5. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf

From these examples, we notice that the outputs for the inputs just before ""walm"" are triples of the same color, and the color corresponds to the word that appears before ""walm"":

- When ""wif"" is before ""walm,"" the color is red (Examples 1, 2, 4, 5).
- When ""dax"" is before ""walm,"" the color is green (Example 3).
- When ""lug"" is before ""walm,"" the color is blue (Example 4).
- When ""zup"" is before ""walm,"" the color is yellow (Example 5).

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's isolate its occurrences and note the color patterns in the outputs.

1. In the first example, the word ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of three reds.
2. In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" and corresponds to three reds before the green associated with ""dax.""
3. In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and leads to three more greens before the red associated with ""wif.""
4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in three blues before the red.
5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows a ""zup"" and a ""lug,"" and before ""dax,"" producing four yellows followed by a sequence of green and two reds.

The pattern here shows that ""walm"" causes the last color before it to repeat three times. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" ""lug,"" or ""dax,"" the colors yellow, blue, and green are repeated, respectively. Even when multiple colors precede it (fifth example), only the color immediately before ""walm"" is repeated.

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let’s look at the patterns involving the word and its corresponding output in different examples:

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
Since ‘zup’ corresponds to ‘yellow’ and ‘wif’ to ‘red,’ we can infer that ‘walm’ possibly means repeating the color mentioned just before it.

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
Here, ‘wif’ is again ‘red,' and the color 'red' is repeated thrice as soon as 'walm' is mentioned. ‘Dax’ is ‘green’ and ‘zup’ is ‘yellow.’

Input: dax walm wif zup
Output: green green green red yellow
‘Dax’ corresponds to ‘green’ and is followed by three greens after ‘walm’, therefore, reinforcing the idea that ‘walm’ causes the preceding color to repeat thrice.

Input: lug walm wif
Output: blue blue blue red
Here, ‘lug’ corresponds to ‘blue’ and is repeated three times right after ‘walm,’ with ‘wif’ then changing the color pattern to ‘red.’

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
‘Zup’ corresponds to ‘yellow’ and appears before and after ‘lug,’ which is ‘blue.’ When ‘walm’ appears after two ‘yellows,’ it causes ‘yellow’ to repeat three more times. ‘Dax’ breaks the sequence with ‘green,’ following the pattern, and ‘wif’ provides 'red' which is again repeated likely due to ‘bluf’ or another rule.

Putting all this evidence together, it is consistently seen that ""walm"" causes the preceding color word to be repeated exactly three times in the output. This leads us to define the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: Walm causes the immediately preceding color in the output to be repeated three times.

2. Input: zup walm → Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" is repeated in the output as ""yellow yellow""

3. Input: zup lug zup wif dax → Output: yellow blue yellow red green
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" correlates with ""blue""
   - ""wif"" correlates with ""red""
   - ""dax"" correlates with ""green""

4. Input: wif walm dax zup → Output: red red red green yellow
   - ""wif"" correlates with ""red""
   - ""walm"" may correspond to repetition of the previous word's color (in this case, ""red red"")
   - ""dax"" correlates with ""green""
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""

5. Input: zup lug → Output: yellow blue
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" correlates with ""blue""

Based on the above, the rule for ""zup"" appears to be consistent, with ""zup"" translating to ""yellow."" The terms ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax"" also consistently translate to ""red,"" ""blue,"" and ""green,"" respectively. The term ""walm"" seems to translate to a repetition of the previous color; although, since ""walm"" only appears once directly after another word, further examples would be beneficial to confirm this pattern.

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> ""yellow""",-5.8427019860980005,108,zup

"Based on the provided examples, the word bluf corresponds to the repeated color of the word immediately preceding it in the sequence. In each case, the color that is associated with the word right before bluf is repeated after bluf in the output. For example:

- In the first example, dax corresponds to the color green, and when bluf is used after dax, the output is ""green yellow yellow,"" where ""green"" is repeated immediately after its first occurrence.
- In the second example, again, dax corresponds to green, and the output for ""lug dax bluf"" is ""blue green green,"" with ""green"" being repeated.
- In the third and fourth examples, lug and dax each have one corresponding color (""blue"" and ""green,"" respectively), and when bluf follows either, their colors are doubled in the output.

"walm -> meaning. Rule:
Based on the given examples, the output for the word ""walm"" consistently results in a repeated sequence of a color. The number of times the color is repeated corresponds to the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence. The specific color that is repeated seems to depend on the word immediately preceding ""walm."" 

Here's the breakdown:
- In the first and second example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" with ""walm"" corresponding to three repetitions of ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""lug zup walm lug"" results in ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" with ""walm"" again corresponding to three repetitions of ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue,"" with ""walm"" corresponding to three repetitions of ""blue"" (since ""lug"" is before ""walm"").
- In the fifth example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" results in ""yellow yellow red red red,"" with ""walm"" corresponding to three repetitions of ""red"" (since ""wif"" is before ""walm"").

From this, we can deduce a rule:

Rule: ""walm"" repeated three times corresponds with the color associated with the word immediately preceding it in the sequence.

Possible colors associated with certain words:
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- wif -> red

5. 'wif' translates to 'red'.

- In ""zup walm"", 'zup' gives 'yellow', and 'walm' repeats it twice.
- In ""lug zup walm lug"", 'zup' gives 'yellow', and 'walm' repeats it twice, surrounded by 'lug' which translates to 'blue'.

"To deduce the rule of ""walm,"" we observe the output associated with each input containing the word ""walm"" and identify any patterns or rules accordingly. Here's the analysis:

1. ""dax walm zup walm"" results in ""green green green yellow yellow yellow."" We notice that ""dax"" precedes three greens and ""zup"" three yellows. ""Walm"" comes before a transition from green to yellow, which are both colors.

2. ""wif lug walm"" results in ""red blue blue blue."" Here, ""wif"" results in red, and ""lug"" in blue, while ""walm"" is followed by three blues.

3. ""zup walm dax"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow green."" In this case, ""zup"" starts with three yellows, and ""dax"" ends with green. ""Walm"" is followed by a color change from yellow to green.

4. ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" results in ""blue blue red blue red red red blue."" ""Lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" to red, and ""bluf"" does not change the color. After ""walm,"" we see a switch from red to blue.

5. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" results in ""red red green green red red red blue red."" Here again, ""walm"" is followed by a color change from red to blue.

From the patterns observed, it seems that ""walm"" is associated with a change in color in the output sequence. It does not produce a color itself but affects the color that follows it, potentially indicating a change from one color sequence to another. However, the color that follows ""walm"" isn't fully consistent in the given examples.

Rule: walm -> causes a change in the color sequence to another color.",-0.892044831914,109,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's break down the patterns:

1. dax walm zup walm -> green green green yellow yellow yellow
2. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue
3. zup walm dax -> yellow yellow yellow green
4. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> blue blue red blue red red red blue
5. wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif -> red red green green red red red blue red

Analyzing the patterns, we can notice:

- ""dax"" is consistently associated with green.
- ""zup"" is consistently associated with yellow.
- ""wif"" is consistently associated with red.
- ""lug"" is consistently associated with blue.

Now focusing on ""walm,"" we can notice:

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" or ""zup"" (Examples 1 and 3), the output corresponding to ""walm"" is the color following the one associated with ""dax"" or ""zup"" (in the order green -> yellow -> red -> blue, like a loop). So after green, it's yellow, and after yellow, it brings back green.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (Examples 2, 4, and 5), the output corresponding to ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""wif"" (red), but with one more instance than ""wif"" itself.
- The pattern in Example 4, with ""lug wif walm lug"", shows that after ""walf"" the pattern resets with ""lug"" back to blue.

The evidence suggests that ""walm"" means to repeat the color of the preceding word, but with a specific rule:

- If the preceding word is ""dax"" or ""zup"", ""walm"" brings the color that follows green or yellow in the sequence.
- If the preceding word is ""wif"", ""walm"" brings one additional instance of red.
- If a new word like ""lug"" follows ""walm,"" the sequence is reset to the color associated with that new word.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word following the specific rules above.",-1.5908843575759999,109,walm
"To induce the meaning of ""walm"" let's analyze the input and output:

1. dax walm zup walm
   green green green yellow yellow yellow
2. wif lug walm
   red blue blue blue
3. zup walm dax
   yellow yellow yellow green
4. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   blue blue red blue red red red blue
5. wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   red red green green red red red blue red

Since the inputs with ""walm"" consistently generate more colors than the input words, ""walm"" is likely a rule for repetition or extending the sequence rather than representing a single color.

In example 1, after ""walm"" the color green is repeated three times followed by three repetitions of yellow. In example 2, ""walm"" is followed by three blues. In example 3, ""dax"" comes after ""walm"" and green is repeated only once. In examples 4 and 5, ""walm"" precedes a series of reds followed by one blue (single instance of ""lug"").

Notice that after ""walm"" the color corresponding to the preceding word is repeated an additional two times. In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and there is only a single additional yellow, likely because ""dax"" comes right after ""walm,"" ending the repetition series.

Let's construct the rule based on these observations:

Rule: After ""walm"", the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word is repeated two more times unless a new word appears immediately after ""walm"" which would limit it to repeating only once.

So, walm -> Rule: Repeat the color of the preceding word two more times, or once if a new word follows immediately after ""walm"".",-1.5980718591600003,109,walm
"Based on the examples provided and analyzing the pattern of the output in relation to the input, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"":

The word ""walm"" seems to cause the output to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. This repetition continues for a number of times based on the sequence of the colors before ""walm"". If we analyze the input and output sequences in conjunction, we can figure out how many times and which color is repeated:

1. In the first example, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" and the output is ""green"" repeated three times. Then ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow"" repeated three times.

2. In the second example, ""lug"" is the word before ""walm"" and the output is ""blue"" repeated four times (which corresponds to the repeat of the colors red and blue before walm).

3. The third example similar to the first, but in reverse order, reinforces that ""zup"" followed by ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" repeated three times, and ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" results in ""green"" repeated once.

4. The fourth example features ""lug"" preceded by multiple words, but ""walm"" only after the second ""wif"". The output results in ""red"" repeated three times after ""walm"", which is consistent with the fact that there were three colors before ""walm"" in this sequence.

5. The fifth example again indicates that ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the preceding color as many times as the sequence of the colors that appeared before it. In this case, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"" because there were three colors before it (red, green, red).

Based on these observations, the induced rule for the nonce word ""walm"" is that it repeats the output color of the word that immediately precedes it for as many times as there have been distinct output colors since the last ""walm"" or the start of the sequence if there was no previous ""walm"". The color repeats are the accumulation of distinct output colors leading up to the ""walm"", not including the word immediately before ""walm"".

Rule: walm -> Repeat the output color of the immediately preceding word for as many times as the total count of distinct output colors since the last occurrence of ""walm"" or the start of the input if ""walm"" has not yet appeared.",-8.66391036694,109,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to examine how it corresponds with changes in the output and look for patterns within the provided input-output examples. Let's analyze each separately:

1. Input: dax walm zup walm
   Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
   
2. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   
3. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   
4. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

5. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red

Let's break it down:

- Each input word corresponds to a color output. For example: ""dax"" -> green, ""zup"" -> yellow, ""wif"" -> red, ""lug"" -> blue.

- Now let's focus on the word ""walm"". When we look at the color outputs for all occurrences of ""walm"", we can see that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it. For instance:
  - In ""dax walm"", ""dax"" outputs as green and then ""walm"" leads to more greens.
  - In ""wif lug walm"", ""lug"" outputs as blue and then ""walm"" results in more blues.
  - In ""zup walm dax"", ""zup"" outputs as yellow, and ""walm"" also leads to yellows before changing to greens due to ""dax"".
  - In ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"", ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" and leads to repeating reds, then ""lug"" outputs as blue.
  - In ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"", ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"", and ""walm"" results in reds again, followed by blue from ""lug"".

From the patterns observed, it appears that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color linked to the word that directly precedes it. If we define this repetition rule as the meaning of ""walm"", it would be:

Rule: walm -> causes the output color to repeat the color associated with the preceding word.",-9.210902469927003,109,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""lug,"" I will analyze each corresponding output for the word ""lug"":

- ""wif dax lug dax"" corresponds to ""red green blue green""
  ""lug"" here corresponds to ""blue"" as it's the new word in the sequence.

- ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" corresponds to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue""
  The first ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" again, and the second ""lug"" also corresponds to ""blue"" consistent with the previous example. 

- ""lug zup"" corresponds to ""blue yellow""
  ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" once more.

- ""wif lug wif"" corresponds to ""red blue red""
  ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" again.

- ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" corresponds to ""blue green yellow green green green red""

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue."" To confirm this deduction, we need to analyze the use of ""lug"" in each input and match it to its placement in the output.

2. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug

5. zup lug dax -> yellow blue green

From the examples, we can see that when ""dax"" is in different positions, the corresponding output color is always green:

- In the 1st and 5th examples, ""dax"" is in the third position and the output color is green.
- In the 2nd and 4th examples, ""dax"" is in the second position and the output color is green.
- In the 3rd example, ""dax"" is in the first position and the output color is green.

Based on this pattern, we can induce that ""dax"" is associated with the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> ""green""",-0.867455518594,110,dax
"From the provided examples, we can infer a pattern in how the word ""dax"" affects the output colors.

1. In the first example, when 'dax' follows 'bluf', the output color is green, and the word 'zup' results in yellow.

2. In the second example, 'dax' follows 'wif', which results in an output of green again. The word 'bluf' also results in green here, and 'wif' produces red.

3. In the third example, only 'dax' and 'walm' are present, and both result in a green output.

4. In the fourth example, 'dax' is in the middle and results in green, while 'zup' is yellow at the beginning and 'lug' is blue at the end.

5. In the fifth example, 'dax' at the end still results in green, with 'zup' at the beginning still yielding yellow, and 'lug' before 'dax' results in blue.

Based on these observations, it seems that the presence of the word 'dax' consistently results in the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence (beginning, middle, end). There doesn't seem to be context dependence for 'dax', unlike the other words which result in different colors based on their position or surrounding words.

Rule: dax -> green. The meaning of ""dax"" consistently translates to the color green, irrespective of its position or context within the sequence it appears in.",-3.41218728129,110,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" is not associated with a consistent color output. Instead, the presence of ""dax"" influences the color output of the following words or its own output if it is not the last word. For example, when ""dax"" precedes another word, the color that follows ""dax"" is always green:

- In ""zup bluf dax,"" ""dax"" is last, and the output is green.
- In ""wif dax bluf,"" ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is green.
- In ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output for ""walm"" is green.
- In ""zup dax lug,"" ""dax"" precedes ""lug,"" and the output for ""lug"" is blue (it's safe to assume ""lug"" would have been red otherwise like in the example given next).
- In ""zup lug dax,"" ""dax"" follows ""lug,"" and the output for ""dax"" is green.

The word that ""dax"" follows or precedes determines the color output for either ""dax"" or the subsequent word. In this case, it appears that ""dax"" causes the following word to output green, or if ""dax"" is the last word, its output is green.

Rule: dax -> If ""dax"" is the last word, its output is green. If ""dax"" is followed by another word, that word's output becomes green, regardless of what it would have been otherwise.",-6.331642886740001,110,dax

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".",-6.939742066347999,110,wif
"Based on the provided examples, ""wif"" translates to a single color each time it appears. Since the output color associated with ""wif"" is consistently red regardless of its position in the sentence or the colors corresponding to the other nonce words like ""lug"" or ""zup,"" the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red",-6.98012005482,110,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" This can be seen consistently across all examples, as every instance of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the output.

"Based on the given examples where ""zup"" is present, it appears that the word ""zup"" is consistently translated as ""yellow"". The other words each correspond to a different color: ""walm"" translates to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, ""dax"" to green, and ""wif bluf"" to double red. However, the presence of ""zup"" does not appear to modify the translation of the other words surrounding it; it is consistently translated independently to ""yellow"".

Rule:
zup -> yellow",-4.950596645171999,110,zup
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""zup"" indicates the color yellow each time it appears. However, it also appears to trigger the output of colors for other accompanying nonce words, such as ""lug"" being blue and ""dax"" being green. The presence of ""zup"" itself does not alter the colors associated with other words, nor does it seem to depend on the position in the sequence. It consistently maps to yellow, and other words map to their respective colors. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow",-5.28729722994,110,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the following pattern can be observed:

- ""zup"" appears at the beginning of the input and is translated to ""yellow"" at the beginning of the output, whether it appears once or twice.
- When ""zup"" appears twice in the input, it is translated as ""yellow"" both times in the output, maintaining its position relative to the other words.
- The input words other than ""zup"" each correspond to a specific color in the output, regardless of their position in the input sequence.
  
Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" appears to be:

Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".",-7.16138705006,110,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"". Regardless of the context or position in the sentence, ""zup"" is replaced with ""yellow"".

2. lug bluf wif -> blue blue red
3. lug bluf -> blue blue
4. wif bluf -> red red
5. zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue

It appears that the output for ""bluf"" directly repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the third and fourth examples, we see the same patterns as the first two examples with ""lug"" leading to ""blue"" and ""wif"" leading to ""red.""
- The fifth example shows ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow."" However, the word ""bluf"" comes after ""lug,"" which correlates to ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" results in the repetition of ""blue.""

So the rule we can derive is:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word immediately before it.

Therefore:

Input: lug bluf -> Output: blue blue
Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
Input: zup lug zup bluf lug -> Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue

For every instance where ""bluf"" is used:
- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red,"" indicating that ""bluf"" takes on the meaning ""red"" when it follows ""wif.""
- ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" takes on the meaning ""blue"" when it follows ""lug.""
- ""zup bluf"" is not shown directly, but based on the pattern, it likely would result in ""yellow yellow,"" if such an input were provided.

We can now analyze the instances of ""dax"":

- In the first example, ""lug dax zup"" turns into ""blue green yellow."" With ""lug"" confirmed as ""blue"" and ""zup"" as ""yellow"", ""dax"", occurring between them, translates to green.
- In the second example, ""dax lug walm"" becomes ""green blue blue blue."" Knowing that ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""walm"" repeats the color ""blue"", ""dax"" must be ""green"".

Summary: 
walm -> The preceding word's color is repeated three times.",-0.497535828105,111,walm
"To determine the meaning of walm, let's look at the provided examples and their corresponding outputs:

- `dax walm` -> `green green green`
- `dax zup walm wif walm` -> `green yellow yellow yellow red red red`
- `zup dax lug walm zup lug` -> `yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue`
- `wif walm dax` -> `red red red green`

In each example, the presence of the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color word that immediately precedes ""walm"", repeated a number of times determined by the position of ""walm"" in the sequence.

- In the first example, ""lug"" is associated with blue, and ""walm"" immediately follows ""lug"", which results in ""blue blue blue"".
- In the second example, ""dax"" is associated with green, which is immediately followed by ""walm"" and results in ""green green green"".
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which gives ""yellow yellow yellow"" and later ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which gives ""red red red"". 
- In the fourth and fifth examples, the pattern continues accordingly with repetitions based on the preceding words (""lug"" -> ""blue"" and ""wif"" -> ""red"").

There are consistent correlations between words and their colors - ""dax"" correlates with green, ""zup"" correlates with yellow, ""lug"" correlates with blue, and ""wif"" correlates with red. When ""walm"" is used after these words, the output is the color related to the preceding word, repeated three times. So the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word three times. If ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the output is ""green green green""; if it follows ""zup"", the output is ""yellow yellow yellow""; if it follows ""lug"", the output is ""blue blue blue""; if it follows ""wif"", the output is ""red red red"".",-6.06572519546,111,walm

5. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

Analyzing these inputs and outputs, I will look for patterns associated with the use of ""walm"" and the resulting color outputs:

- In example 1, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue."" We see ""lug"" alone represent ""blue,"" so ""walm"" appears to play a role in repeating the color of the word before it thrice.
- In example 2, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green."" ""Dax"" represents ""green,"" and with ""walm"" following it, the output is three times ""green.""
- In example 3, ""walm"" appears twice. Before the first ""walm,"" the word is ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow."" This is followed by ""yellow yellow yellow."" Then again, with ""wif walm,"" preceding ""wif"" means ""red,"" and we get ""red red red"" following it.
- In example 4, ""lug walm"" within the sequence produces ""blue blue blue,"" again suggesting repetition of the preceding color.
- Example 5 continues to support this pattern, with ""wif walm"" producing ""red red red.""

Therefore, the consistent rule here seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color of the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times:

"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by looking for patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Looking at the first and fourth examples where the input is simply ""wif"", the output is ""red"" for both. This suggests that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" when it appears alone.

However, in contexts with other words, ""wif"" still translates to ""red"", but the other words translate to different colors:

- In the second example, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" to ""green"".
- In the third example, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" seems to duplicate the previous color based on ""walm wif"" resulting in ""green green red"".
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" translates to ""green"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""walm"" again duplicates the previous color, as ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"".

From this, we can deduce that ""wif"" is consistently translated to the color ""red"", regardless of context.

Rule: wif -> red",-3.628584286532,112,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that certain nonce words correspond to specific colors. Here's the pattern that emerges from the examples:

- The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red.""
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" when it appears in the second example.
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" when it appears in the third example.
- The word ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""green"" when it is followed by ""wif"" in the third and fifth examples. However, since ""walm"" appears twice before ""wif"" in the third example and is translated as ""green green,"" it is highly likely that ""walm"" translates to ""green"" regardless of its position relative to ""wif.""

From the above observations, the consistent rule that can be discerned is as follows:

- Example 2 uses ""wif"" twice, and each occurrence translates to ""red."" The other words translate to different colors, suggesting that ""wif"" is not context-dependent within these examples.
- Example 3 uses ""wif"" once at the end, and it again translates to ""red,"" even when surrounded by other words that translate to different colors.
- Example 4 repeats the first example, providing further evidence that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" regardless of context.

"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look at the patterns associated with other words first:

- ""wif"" always results in ""red.""
- ""dax"" always results in ""green.""
- ""lug"" always results in ""blue.""

- ""bluf"" always results in ""yellow.""

2. ""zup walm dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green blue""
3. ""lug zup dax wif zup"" -> ""blue yellow green red yellow""

"Based on the examples provided, to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we should look for a pattern in each example that could explain its associated output:

1. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow

   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow""

3. Input: lug wif bluf

5. Input: lug bluf zup lug
   Output: blue blue yellow blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Based on the provided data, it appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it. When it is the first word (no word before it), it takes on the color of the word that follows it, which can be seen in examples 1 and 4 where ""bluf"" is the last word and follows ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word. If there is no preceding word, it takes the color of the following word.",-4.807823827236,112,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the patterns of input and output:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- Whenever ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow.""
- Whenever ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue.""
- Whenever ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red.""

Now, let's look at the occurrences of ""bluf"":

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax zup,"" the output is ""yellow.""
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug wif lug,"" the output is ""blue.""
3. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug wif,"" the output is ""red.""
4. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax zup,"" the output is again ""yellow.""
5. When ""bluf"" precedes ""zup lug,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue.""

From these observations, we can see that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word or maintains the sequence's current color pattern. The instances where ""bluf"" is followed by a different word (example 5) might imply that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that just appeared, regardless of its position in the sequence. Based on this, we can form a rule about the meaning of ""bluf"":

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word in the sequence or continues the current color pattern if there is a repeating word before it.",-6.0460500788200005,112,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color corresponding to the previous word in the sequence.

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""dax zup bluf,"" ""zup"" translates to yellow, and then ""bluf"" also translates to yellow.
- In the second example, ""lug wif lug bluf,"" ""lug"" translates to blue twice, and ""bluf"" directly follows another ""lug,"" resulting in another blue.
- In the third example, ""lug wif bluf,"" ""wif"" translates to red, followed by ""bluf,"" which also translates to red.
- The fourth example is identical to the first, providing the same translation for ""bluf"" (yellow) after ""zup.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug bluf zup lug,"" ""lug"" before ""bluf"" translates to blue, and thus ""bluf"" is again blue; ""zup"" translates to yellow, but it is not directly before a ""bluf.""

Therefore, bluf -> the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it.",-7.226744672778,112,bluf

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the corresponding outputs for each given input where ""walm"" is present:

1. Input: ""zup walm"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
   - Here, ""walm"" corresponds to two ""yellow"" after ""zup.""

2. Input: ""dax lug wif walm"" -> Output: ""green blue red red red""
   - Here, ""walm"" corresponds to three ""red"" after ""wif.""
   
3. Input: ""zup lug walm wif walm"" -> Output: ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""
   - In this case, ""walm"" initially corresponds to three ""blue"" after ""lug,"" and then to three ""red"" after ""wif.""

4. Input: ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" -> Output: ""blue green yellow green green green red""
   - Here, ""walm"" corresponds to three ""green"" after ""dax.""
   
5. Input: ""wif walm dax zup"" -> Output: ""red red red green yellow""
   - In this example, ""walm"" is followed by two additional colors not directly associated with the words preceding ""walm.""

From the above examples, it appears that ""walm"" reproduces the color corresponding to the word right before it, three times. It does this for each instance of the word preceding ""walm."" Hence:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the preceding word three times. If ""walm"" is the first word, it repeats the color ""red"" specific to ""wif,"" potentially due to ""wif"" being the closest preceding word with a defined color. However, because we have only one example where ""walm"" is the first word, this part of the rule is an assumption based on limited data.

Therefore:
walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",-0.5575708691899999,112,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color word that follows a certain rule or pattern. Let's analyze the provided examples:

3. ""zup lug walm wif walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""
4. ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" -> ""blue green yellow green green green red""
5. ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow""

From the examples, it seems that each occurrence of ""walm"" creates a repetition of the preceding color words, taking the last mentioned color and repeating it three times. 

Rule: walm -> repetition of the last mentioned color word three times.",-1.2470088406,112,walm
"Based on the examples provided, each input corresponds to a unique color output, and the presence of walm in each input leads to multiple repetitions of the color red in the output. The number of reds seems to depend on the other words that precede walm in the input. Specifically, the number of reds after the word ""walm"" equals the total number of color words that come before it in the sequence.

Here's the breakdown:
- ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow""; ""zup"" corresponds to one yellow, and walm causes it to repeat two more times, making three yellows.
- ""dax lug wif walm"" translates to ""green blue red red red""; ""dax lug wif"" corresponds to three colors before walm, so walm is repeated three times as red.
- ""zup lug walm wif walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""; here, ""walm"" after ""zup lug"" results in two additional blues, and then ""wif walm"" afterwards adds three reds (since there are three colors preceding the second walm).
- ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" translates to ""blue green yellow green green green red""; ""walm"" follows four colors, so it outputs four greens.
- ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow""; ""wif"" turns into two additional reds caused by walm, and then ""dax zup"" follows normally.

From these observations, the rule that can be deduced is:

Rule: walm causes the last mentioned color word to be repeated a number of times equal to the total number of color words mentioned before walm in the sequence.

So, the meaning of walm is:

walm -> A repetition trigger for the last mentioned color, occurring as many times as the number of color references before it in the sequence.",-1.372097941956,112,walm
"Walm -> meaning. Based on the above examples, ""walm"" seems to be associated with the output of a series of reds.

- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""walm"" seems to result in multiple red outputs, equal to the count of words before it.

"Reviewing the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" has the repeated effect of duplicating the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. Here is what we can deduce from the examples:

In the first example, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and when ""walm"" follows, it continues to produce the color yellow until a new color word is introduced:

- ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" turns into ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red.""

In the second example:

- ""zup walm wif"" turns into ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" which follows the same rule—'walm' continues the previous color (yellow) until ""wif"" introduces a new color (red).

In the third and fourth examples:

- The output ""dax walm"" turning into ""green green green"" suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" replicates that color.

Finally, in the fifth example:

- ""lug wif walm"" produces ""blue red red red,"" indicating that ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) and continues with red, suggesting that ""walm"" expresses replication of the preceding color.

Therefore, the rule for “walm” seems to be that it replicates the color corresponding to the word that precedes it, effectively extending the sequence of that color until another color word is mentioned.

Rule: walm -> replicates the previous color word's corresponding color.",-1.2469526353520002,113,walm
"Analyzing the given examples, I will deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" Here are the key points to consider:

1. In every instance where ""walm"" is present, the output results in three repetitions of the color that preceded it. This pattern is consistent and can be validated across all examples.

To demonstrate:
- ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" includes ""walm"" after ""zup,"" and the output shows ""yellow"" three times after ""yellow blue yellow.""
- ""zup walm wif"" includes ""walm"" after ""zup,"" and the output shows ""yellow"" three times before ""red.""
- ""dax walm"" has ""walm"" following ""dax,"" and the output is ""green"" repeated three times.
- The same is true for the repeated ""dax walm"" example.
- ""lug wif walm"" has ""walm"" at the end, following ""wif,"" and the output has ""red"" repeated three times after ""blue red.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times in the output.

"Rule: walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the word before it three times.

Example:

- In ""zup walm wif"", ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, so after ""zup"", ""walm"" causes three more yellows followed by red for ""wif"".

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we will compare the inputs and their corresponding outputs, looking for patterns that help define the word ""dax.""

1. In the first input, ""wif dax zup,"" the word ""dax"" is surrounded by two colors in the output: ""wif"" is translated as ""red"" and ""zup"" is translated as ""yellow."" The output for ""dax"" in this context is ""green.""

2. In the second input, ""zup dax lug dax,"" we see ""dax"" twice, and each time it corresponds to ""green"" in the output sequence, occurring after ""zup -> yellow"" and ""lug -> blue.""

3. The third input, ""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax,"" shows ""dax"" at the end of the sequence following two instances of ""bluf."" Since ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and we see that ""bluf"" doesn't seem to change the color output, it appears that ""bluf"" might be a repeat command. The ""dax"" follows ""yellow"" here and is once again ""green.""

4. In the fourth input, ""zup dax bluf,"" we have the ""dax"" positioned after ""zup,"" translating to ""yellow green,"" followed by ""bluf,"" which we suspect is a repeater since the output is ""green"" again.

5. Finally, the fifth input, ""lug dax zup dax walm wif,"" provides us with another sequence where ""dax"" is surrounded by known translations, with the added ""walm"" before ""wif,"" and the output for both ""walm"" and ""wif"" is ""green."" This might suggest ""walm"" has no impact on the output color, or it could possibly be synonymous with ""dax.""

"From the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to a color. To deduce what ""bluf"" means, let's look at the corresponding colors in the outputs for each input where ""bluf"" is present:

1. Input: ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" corresponds to Output: ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow"". Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"", but since there are other instances of ""yellow"" corresponding to ""zup"", we cannot conclude that ""bluf"" means ""yellow"" alone.

2. Input: ""zup bluf lug dax lug"" corresponds to Output: ""yellow yellow blue green blue"". Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

3. Input: ""zup dax bluf"" corresponds to Output: ""yellow green green"". Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"".

5. Input: ""wif bluf"" corresponds to Output: ""red red"". Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".

Taking all the examples into consideration, it seems that ""bluf"" does not correspond consistently to a single color.

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look closely at its usage in the given examples and the corresponding outputs.

- In the first example, ""zup walm wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow red."" Since ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" we can assume ""walm"" translates to ""yellow"" as well, since it's repeated in the output.

- In the second example, ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" becomes ""green green green red blue green green green."" Here, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""wif"" again translates to ""red,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" Since ""walm"" appears twice, and ""green"" immediately follows both times, it's reasonable to assume that ""walm"" still translates to ""green.""

- In the third example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green."" Again, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""walm"" appears to maintain the translation of ""green.""

- The fourth example, ""zup bluf wif walm,"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red."" Since ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" ""wif"" means ""red,"" and ""bluf"" is a new word yet ""red"" follows it, which might imply ""bluf"" also means ""red."" Meanwhile, ""walm"" is followed by two additional ""red"" words, which is consistent with ""bluf"" seemingly intensifying the color red.

- The fifth example, ""zup walm dax zup dax wif,"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red."" Here, each ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" each ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" as seen before. The presence of ""walm"" results in an additional ""green"" following the pattern started by the preceding ""dax.""

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" is a color intensifier or duplicator, causing the preceding color word to be repeated in the output one additional time. Whenever ""walm"" appears after a color word in the input, that color word is translated into its corresponding color twice in the output.

Rule: ""walm"" causes the preceding color word's output to be repeated once.

Walm -> meaning: A repetition intensifier for the immediately preceding color word.",-0.8004482267939999,114,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce a rule for the nonce word ""walm"" in relation to the given outputs. Let's examine the instances of ""walm"" and their corresponding outputs.

1. ""zup walm wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow red""
2. ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" -> ""green green green red blue green green green""
3. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
4. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red""
5. ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red""

In each instance, the word ""walm"" directly corresponds to a series of three colors that match the preceding word's color. Specifically, ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"" and ""dax"" is associated with ""green."" When ""walm"" follows these words, the pattern is that ""walm"" results in three repetitions of that color:

- When preceded by ""zup,"" ""walm"" outputs three ""yellow.""
- When preceded by ""dax,"" ""walm"" outputs three ""green.""

Therefore, the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" in these examples appears to be:

Rule: 'walm' -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",-1.039030372244,114,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm"" from the given examples, we need to look at the patterns in the input and corresponding output. Here's the breakdown of each example:

1. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   Observation: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""; ""walm"" is between them.

2. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   Observation: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""; ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""wif"" again, similar to example 1.
   
3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Observation: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""; only ""walm"" follows.

4. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   Observation: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""bluf"" is not defined but might correspond to a single ""red"" like ""wif"", and ""walm"" is following ""wif"".

5. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
   Observation: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""; ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""dax"" and follows ""dax"".

By examining the occurrences of ""walm"" in the input and their corresponding outputs, we notice that when ""walm"" appears, it adds two of the color that was last mentioned before it to the output. So if ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"" is mentioned before ""walm,"" then ""walm"" adds two yellows, if ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"" is mentioned before ""walm,"" then ""walm"" adds two greens to the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word twice.",-6.79077256037,114,walm
"To deduce what ""walm"" means, we need to analyze the positions where ""walm"" appears and the corresponding output colors.

Let's list the examples and outputs while highlighting ""walm"":

1. zup (walm) wif 
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red

2. dax (walm) wif lug dax (walm)
   Output: green green green red blue green green green

3. dax (walm)
   Output: green green green

4. zup bluf wif (walm)
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

5. zup (walm) dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

When we look at the outputs, we can deduce the following observations:

- ""walm"" consistently results in a series of colors where the sequence length is always three.
- The first color in the sequence of three appears to be related to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" For example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" while ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green.""
- The word that follows ""walm"" does not affect the output colors that are directly associated with ""walm.""

Based on these observations, we can establish a rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" outputs a sequence of three colors that correspond to the color associated with the word before ""walm.""

So, if we have to write it like:

walm -> A sequence of three colors based on the preceding word, with no influence from following words.",-8.088900476784,114,walm
"To deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs across the examples provided:

1. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   
2. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
      
3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   
4. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   
5. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

We will look for patterns in relation to ""walm"":

- In the first input, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""wif,"" and the output is three yellows, ending with a red. ""wif"" has been associated with red in previous tasks, so we can leave that aside.
- In the second input, ""walm"" again follows ""dax"" and also precedes ""wif""; the output segment is three greens before a red. The pattern suggests that ""walm"" following ""dax"" also results in a green output, similar to just ""dax"" preceding it.
- In the third input, ""walm"" only follows ""dax,"" and we again get three greens.
- In the fourth input, ""walm"" is at the end following a red output (""wif""), this time we see a sequence of reds.
- In the fifth input, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""dax,"" with three yellows in the output, followed by a green, which is the output for ""dax.""

In all cases, it seems that ""walm"" results in a repetition of three instances of the color that would result from the word that precedes it:

- After ""zup,"" it causes three yellows, because ""zup"" results in yellow.
- After ""dax,"" it causes three greens, because ""dax"" results in green.
- When following ""wif,"" which gives red, it causes a continuation of red output.

From this, we can infer the rule for ""walm"":

Analysis: The appearance of ""wif"" as the first word also results in the word ""red"".

Input: wif
Output: red
Analysis: ""wif"" alone translates directly to ""red"".

Input: lug wif dax wif
Output: blue red green red
Analysis: Again, each occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red"".

Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
Analysis: In both instances where ""wif"" is used, it translates to ""red"".

From these examples, we can induce that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently correlates with the word ""red"".

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" we should look at each example and identify the pattern regarding the presence of ""zup"" and the colors in the output.

In the first input-output pair:
dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

The word ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" and the pattern for ""walm"" seems to be a triplet of the same color; however, ""blue"" appears just before the triple ""yellow."" Since there is only one ""zup"" and only one ""blue,"" it's likely that ""zup"" corresponds to ""blue.""

In the second input-output pair:
zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow

The occurrence of ""zup"" again leads to a triplet, but ""zup"" by itself does not provide us with a clear indication of a single color. Yet, from the first example, we could guess that ""zup"" by itself could still represent ""blue.""

In the third input-output pair:
dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> green blue yellow red red green

Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" It's important to note that the word ""lug"" precedes ""zup"" and is paired with ""blue.""

In the fourth input-output pair:
zup wif walm -> yellow red red red

Once again, the ""zup"" is preceding the color ""yellow."" 

In the fifth input-output pair:
dax zup dax zup wif -> green yellow green yellow red

The word ""zup"" is consistently preceded by ""dax,"" and each ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" When ""dax"" appears, it's green, when ""zup"" appears, it's yellow.

Putting all these observations together, the resulting pattern can be summarized in the following rule:

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.

Therefore:

zup -> yellow.",-0.8943724447160001,115,zup
"Based on the given examples where the word ""zup"" appears and the associated color output sequences, we can deduce the following rule for the meaning of ""zup"":

Rule:
""zup"" corresponds to a color output that changes based on its position relative to other words and possibly the history of previous colors mentioned. To determine the specific rule for ""zup,"" we can examine its occurrences and the outputs:

1. dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
2. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
3. dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> green blue yellow red red green
4. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
5. dax zup dax zup wif -> green yellow green yellow red

Now we can check the positions where ""zup"" occurs and the following color patterns. After ""zup"" we always have ""yellow."" If we look at the strings where ""zup"" is not the first word, the color before ""zup"" never appears as ""yellow."" Therefore, it seems that ""zup"" doesn't have a fixed color, but rather a rule that defines its color based on its position or a sequence.

After examining the sequences, one possible induction could be:

""zup"" changes the sequence's pattern by inserting a ""yellow,"" while maintaining or restarting the pattern of the other colors after its own occurrence.

So:

zup -> changes the sequence's pattern by inserting a ""yellow"" and influences the pattern of the following words.

However, this rule is tentative and based on the given examples. Different examples might reveal further nuances to the rule for ""zup.""",-1.2911207415860002,115,zup
"Analyzing the examples provided, we can deduce a pattern for the word ""zup"" and its corresponding output.

In the first example:
- The sequence ""walm lug zup walm"" results in ""red red blue yellow yellow yellow"". Notably, ""walm"" without ""zup"" results in two repetitions of ""red"", and with ""zup"" following, adds ""blue"" and an extra ""yellow.""

In the second example:
- ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""zup"" does not merely repeat the color assigned to ""walm.""

In the third example:
- ""dax lug zup wif"" results in ""green blue yellow red."" It's evident that ""zup"" here is associated with ""yellow"" yet again, not bound to the color for ""wif.""

In the fourth example:
- ""zup wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow red red red."" The presence of ""zup"" in front of ""wif walm"" leads to a series of ""red"" but begins with ""yellow.""

In the fifth example:
- ""dax zup dax zup wif"" results in ""green yellow green yellow red."" The ""zup"" reliably converts to ""yellow,"" regardless of its surrounding words.

Based on these observations, we can conclude the following rule:

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, independent of the context it appears in.

Therefore, the meaning can be written as follows:

zup -> yellow.",-4.1512057358900005,115,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds with a color output that changes depending on the context. To deduce the rule, let's examine each case and look for patterns.

First Example:
- Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
- Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

We see ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" ""walm"" maps to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" maps to ""red."" ""Zup"" seems to be the only variable word between the first ""lug"" and the repeating ""walm"" sequence. It corresponds to ""blue"" in the output sequence. But we need more to deduce a pattern.

Second Example:
- Input: zup walm
- Output: yellow yellow yellow

Here, ""walm"" maps to ""yellow,"" and ""zup,"" which precedes it, also maps to ""yellow."" It indicates that ""zup"" is dictating the same color as the following word, rather than having its inherent color.

Third Example:
- Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
- Output: green blue yellow red red green

We notice that ""zup"" comes before ""wif,"" and the corresponding color for ""wif"" is ""red."" In this case, ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" in the output, which doesn't follow the pattern from the previous example.

Fourth Example:
- Input: zup wif walm
- Output: yellow red red red

Again, ""wif"" maps to ""red"" and is preceded by ""zup,"" which in this scenario corresponds to ""yellow,"" similar to the third example.

Fifth Example:
- Input: dax zup dax zup wif
- Output: green yellow green yellow red

Here, ""zup"" precedes different words (""dax"" and ""wif""), and in both cases, ""zup"" maps to ""yellow."" It implies that ""zup"" might have its distinct output independent of context.

From these examples, we can deduce that:

1. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
2. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
3. ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

""Zup"" doesn't always follow the immediate repeating pattern correlation, nor does it seem to consistently adopt the color of the following word. Considering the pattern across all examples, ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"" more than once and disregards the context of the following words. Thus, it seems reasonable to deduce that ""zup"" has an inherent value that it contributes to the sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow",-8.372502859632998,115,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

Each of the example inputs where the nonce word ""zup"" appears consistently results in the color ""yellow"" appearing in the output. The color appears as many times as ""zup"" appears in the input, suggesting a one-to-one correspondence between the occurrences of the word ""zup"" and the color ""yellow"" in the output.",-10.77612891036,115,zup
"To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at the pattern of inputs and their corresponding outputs.

- When ""bluf"" is paired with ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue.""
- ""Bluf"" on its own appears to generate the output ""green green.""
- When ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"" and ""zup,"" and followed by either ""wif"" or ""lug,"" the output for ""bluf"" is consistently ""blue.""
- The output of other words such as ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax"" appear to correlate to specific colors: ""wif"" -> red, ""zup"" -> yellow, ""lug"" -> blue, ""dax"" -> green.

Using these patterns, we can hypothesize the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" likely represents the color ""blue"" as its output is consistently ""blue"" when it follows other nonce words related to colors. The exception is when it is unpaired or only with ""dax,"" it seems to duplicate the color of the preceding word (""dax"" in this example, giving ""green green""). Therefore, when ""bluf"" stands with or follows certain words, it adopts the characteristic color of those words. 

Based on the given examples, the rule for ""bluf"" might be:

bluf -> meaning: When ""bluf"" follows a color-associated nonce word, it reflects the color attributed to that word as ""blue."" When on its own or with ""dax,"" it reflects the color of ""dax,"" which is green, twice.",-6.3558531258,115,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> blue. The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue, as evidenced by its consistent translation to ""blue"" across all examples.",-10.277676810840001,115,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" correlates with the color ""blue"" in the output. Each time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output. No other input words seem to generate the same color in the output every time they appear, suggesting that ""bluf"" directly translates to ""blue"" regardless of context.

Rule: bluf -> blue",-10.344141317439998,115,bluf
Rule: bluf -> blue,-10.74101655512,115,bluf
Rule: bluf -> blue,-10.74101655512,115,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the output color corresponding to the word immediately before it. Specifically, the number of times the color is repeated seems to be three, regardless of which color it is associated with.

Let's verify this with each given example:

Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
Here, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to ""yellow,"" so after ""zup,"" there are three ""yellow"" in the output.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
Here, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to ""blue,"" and we see three ""blue"" in the output.

Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
Here, ""wif"" precedes the first ""walm"" and ""zup"" precedes the second ""walm."" The output is three ""red"" after the first ""wif"" and three ""yellow"" after the second ""zup.""

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" which is repeated three times in the output after ""zup.""

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
Here, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to ""red,"" which is then repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times in the output.",-6.630923974200998,115,walm
"Observing the patterns of the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can deduce the following:

- The words ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""dax"" correspond to the colors ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" ""red,"" and ""green,"" respectively.
- The word ""walm"" seems to have a repeating pattern when used in conjunction with other words. In all the instances, the presence of ""walm"" in the input leads to a set of three colors in the output. The color that is repeated three times corresponds to the color word that appears immediately before ""walm"" in the input sequence.

Given the above observations, we can infer the meaning of ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times in the output.",-7.795272815180001,115,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" I'll examine the association of its appearance in the inputs and the corresponding colors in the outputs:

1. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm   
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   
2. Input: lug walm   
   Output: blue blue blue
   
3. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm   
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   
4. Input: zup walm   
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   
5. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm   
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

Let's first establish the colors associated with the non-walm words:

- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> blue
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green

Now, examining the inclusion of ""walm"" and the pattern of colored outputs:

- After ""zup"" and ""walm,"" there are always more ""yellow""s.
- After ""lug"" and ""walm,"" there are more ""blue""s.
- After ""wif"" and ""walm,"" there are more ""red""s.
- After ""dax,"" ""wif,"" and followed by ""walm,"" results in additional ""red""s.

It appears that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word preceding it. So ""walm"" likely means repeat the previous color:

Rule: walm -> repeat the previous color.",-7.810826161358001,115,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it is possible to deduce that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color produced by the word that precedes it. To confirm this, let's analyze the examples:

Example 1:
Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
Here, ""zup"" results in ""yellow"", and when ""walm"" follows ""zup"", ""yellow"" is repeated.

Example 2:
Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
Here, ""lug"" results in ""blue"", and ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated two more times.

Example 3:
Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
Here ""wif"" results in ""red"", and ""walm"" after ""wif"" repeats ""red"" two additional times. Then after ""zup"", ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" two more times.

Example 4:
Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
Again, ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" and ""walm"" repeats it two more times.

Example 5:
Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
Here, ""wif"" leads to ""red"", and ""walm"" causes it to be repeated two additional times.

Rule:
walm -> Causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated two additional times.",-7.819700598393,115,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look closely at the correspondence between the inputs and their associated outputs, taking into account any patterns in the sequence of colors produced.

Here's a breakdown of each input and output sequence:

1. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   
   Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". The word ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which had given ""yellow"" so far and continues to give yellows after.

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   
   ""Lug"" directly corresponds to the color ""blue."" After ""lug,"" we have ""walm,"" which also generates ""blue"" colors, matching the color from the preceding word.
   
3. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   
   ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" with ""lug"" still matching ""blue."" ""Walm"" appears after ""wif"" and precedes ""zup,"" so it continues ""red"" until ""zup"" changes the sequence to ""yellow.""
   
4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   
   As before, ""zup"" means ""yellow."" Here, ""walm"" continues the sequence with ""yellow"" without change.
   
5. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   
   ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" to ""yellow."" The word ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" and continues the sequence with ""red"" which means it duplicates the preceding color.

From the observations, each color word seems to establish a color until a new color word is introduced. Following this pattern, ""walm"" can be deduced to mean that it continues the same color that directly precedes it without changing to another color.

Rule: dax -> green",-11.617707050619998,116,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. Each time ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. Here are the examples again, with an explanation for each one:

- Input: wif bluf
  Output: red red
  ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" has also been associated with red (as seen in the third example).

- Input: zup wif
  Output: yellow red
  ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""wif"" corresponds to red.

- Input: lug bluf wif
  Output: blue blue red
  ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""bluf"" corresponds to blue (consistent with the first example when isolated with ""wif""), and ""wif"" corresponds to red.

- Input: zup wif walm
  Output: yellow red red red
  ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" seems to correspond to a triplication of the preceding color, hence three times red.

- Input: wif zup dax bluf
  Output: red yellow green green
  ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""zup"" to yellow, ""dax"" to green, and ""bluf"" now is associated with green as well, which seems contradictory given the previous examples unless ""dax"" has the effect of changing the following color to green.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" translates to the color red, but keep in mind that the meaning of ""bluf"" seems somewhat inconsistent, and the behavior of ""dax"" may have a modifying effect on the color represented by the following word.

Rule: wif -> red",-4.479969207431,116,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's examine each pair of inputs and outputs:

1. Input: wif bluf | Output: red red
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the repetition suggests ""wif"" also corresponds to ""red.""

2. Input: zup wif | Output: yellow red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and following the previous example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

3. Input: lug bluf wif | Output: blue blue red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" (due to the first example, but here it is blue which is possibly a context-dependent discrepancy), and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

4. Input: zup wif walm | Output: yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" requires four instances of ""red"" in the output but is only one word, suggesting it may mean a repetition of the following word, in this case ""red.""

5. Input: wif zup dax bluf | Output: red yellow green green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" here corresponds to ""green,"" which is different from the first and third examples.

The discrepancy in ""bluf"" between the first and third examples (both red), and the fifth example (green) suggests that ""bluf"" might change its corresponding color based on the presence or absence of other words, or based on its position within the sequence. This change does not impact the meaning of ""wif,"" which consistently corresponds to ""red"" across all examples.

Rule: wif -> red",-5.4787967494490015,116,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" let's look at the input and output pairs and try to identify a pattern:

1. Input: wif bluf - Output: red red
2. Input: zup wif - Output: yellow red
3. Input: lug bluf wif - Output: blue blue red
4. Input: zup wif walm - Output: yellow red red red
5. Input: wif zup dax bluf - Output: red yellow green green

From these examples, it appears that each instance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output. 

- In every example we can see that ""wif"" correlates with ""red.""
- In the first example, we see no other input apart from ""wif"" and ""bluf,"" and the output is ""red red,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" might also have a consistent output (potentially ""red,"" but that is not the focus here).
- The second example shows that preceding ""wif"" with ""zup"" does not change the output associated with ""wif,"" which is still ""red.""
- In the third, we see that ""wif"" is at the end of a sequence, with ""lug"" and ""bluf"" before it, and it still correlates to ""red"" at the end of the output sequence.
- The fourth example again reinforces that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" as ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red.""
- The fifth example is interesting, as it suggests that other words (""zup"" and ""dax"") might have their own color associations, but ""wif"" at the start of a sequence still leads to ""red"" as the first color in the output.

Based on this analysis:

Rule: wif -> red",-5.736891206709999,116,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the input-output pairs given in the examples:

3. lug → blue, bluf → blue (same as preceding word)
4. lug → blue, bluf → blue (same as preceding word), but zup → yellow after
5. dax → green, bluf → green (same as preceding word)

Based on these observations, the rule for bluf appears to be that it takes the color of the word that precedes it.

"Observing the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" is associated with repeating the color of the word that precedes it three more times. Here is the analysis that supports this:

1. In the first example, ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" Here ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" seems to repeat ""blue"" three more times.

2. In the second example, ""lug walm zup"" leads to ""blue blue blue yellow."" After ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" ""walm"" again repeats ""blue"" three times.

3. The third example, ""lug wif walm,"" becomes ""blue red red red."" The word before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""red"" thrice.

4. In the fourth input, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" the output is ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" The occurrence of ""walm"" after a ""zup"" results in three additional ""yellow."" 

5. The fifth input, ""wif walm zup lug zup walm,"" results in ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and ""zup,"" creating three more ""reds"" and later three more ""yellows,"" respectively.

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" follows it, resulting in ""green blue blue blue."" Here, blue is repeated three times, indicating that ""walm"" might mean ""repeat the previous color three times.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" follows it, resulting in ""blue blue blue yellow."" Here again, blue is repeated three times.
- In the third example, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" follows it, resulting in ""blue red red red."" Here, red is repeated three times.
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" follows it somewhere in the middle of the sequence, resulting in a repetition of yellow three times after ""walm.""
- In the fifth example, both instances of ""walm"" follow ""wif"" and ""zup,"" each time resulting in the repetition of the preceding color three times (red and yellow, respectively).

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word three times.",-6.065969382366001,116,walm
"Observing the pattern in the examples given, it appears that the word ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color that was mentioned just before it. Each time ""walm"" follows a word, the color associated with that preceding word is repeated once more than the number of times ""walm"" appears in sequence.

Let's verify the rule with the examples:

1. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Rule application: ""lug"" correlates to blue, followed by a ""walm"", which means to repeat ""blue"" an additional time (total of three times).

2. Input: lug walm zup
   Output: blue blue blue yellow
   Rule application: ""lug"" correlates to blue, followed by a ""walm"", which means to repeat ""blue"" (total of three times) until a different word (""zup"") that correlates to a different color (yellow) appears.

3. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   Rule application: ""wif"" correlates to red, followed by a ""walm"", which means to repeat ""red"" an additional time (total of three times).

4. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   Rule application: ""zup"" is yellow; ""lug"" is blue; another ""zup"" is yellow followed by a ""walm"", which repeats ""yellow"" (total of three times); ""dax"" correlates to green; ""wif"" to red, and ""bluf"" likely to a red variation, hence repeated once (based on the appearance of ""wif"" before).

5. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   Rule application: ""wif"" correlates to red, followed by a ""walm"", which repeats ""red"" (total of three times); ""zup"" is yellow; ""lug"" is blue; another ""zup"" is yellow followed by a ""walm"", which repeats ""yellow"" (total of three times).

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be:

Rule: When the word ""walm"" appears, it indicates to repeat the color of the word immediately before ""walm"" an additional number of times equal to the number of times ""walm"" appears in sequence.

Therefore, walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word an additional number of times.",-6.275036132675001,116,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" we need to analyze the patterns in the Input and their corresponding Output. Let's examine each Input and Output pair.

1. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   
Here, ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" and results in three instances of ""blue."" There's no other word in between them to cause the repitition.

2. Input: lug walm zup
   Output: blue blue blue yellow
   
In this example, ""walm"" directly follows ""lug"" again and is followed by ""zup,"" which gives us ""yellow."" The ""walm"" seems to be triggering repetitions of the color associated with ""lug"" (blue) before the sequence changes due to ""zup.""

3. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   
Here, ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" then ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and ""walm"" again leads to repetitions, but this time it's the color associated with the word immediately before it, which is ""red.""

4. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   
In this case, ""zup"" is associated with yellow, ""lug"" is blue, and another ""zup"" is still yellow. Then ""walm"" appears and we see more yellow, implying that it again causes a repetition of the color before it, before the sequence moves on to new words and colors with ""dax"" being green and ""wif"" with ""bluf"" being red red.

5. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   
Here, ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" which is associated with ""red,"" and causes repetition of red. Then, after ""zup"" and ""lug,"" ""walm"" appears again, leading to repetitions of the color before it, which is ""yellow"" in this case.

Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Wherever ""walm"" appears, the output repeats the color of the prior word multiple times until a new word is introduced after ""walm.""

- In example 1 (""dax lug walm""), ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" we see ""blue"" repeated three times.
- In example 2 (""lug walm zup""), again ""lug"" is before ""walm"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times after ""walm.""
- In example 3 (""lug wif walm""), ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and its corresponding color, ""red,"" is repeated three times after ""walm.""

- In example 5 (""wif walm zup lug zup walm""), each instance of ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and ""zup,"" both times leading to a three-time repetition of the respective colors ""red"" and ""yellow.""

- When ""dax"" appears after ""wif"", the output is ""green"" after ""red"" (Examples 3 and 4).
- In the mixed sequence (Example 2), ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", just like in previous examples with simpler sequences.

- When the input is ""zup lug zup dax,"" the output is ""yellow blue yellow green."" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" Since the outputs corresponding to ""zup"" are both ""yellow,"" it seems consistent that ""zup"" means ""yellow.""

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we'll look for patterns in each input-output pair. Consider the colors produced by each word in the input and how they change when ""walm"" is introduced.

1. ""dax"" individually generates ""green""
2. ""zup"" individually generates ""yellow""
3. ""lug"" individually generates ""blue""
4. ""wif"" individually generates ""red""
5. ""bluf"" individually generates ""red""

Now, let's analyze ""walm"" in this context.

- In the first example, after ""dax zup dax walm,"" the output is ""green yellow green green green."" Here, ""walm"" changes the output from possibly replicating the colors of the previous words to all ""green."" It seems to mimic and extend the color of ""dax.""

- In the second example, ""lug walm wif bluf"" gives ""blue blue blue red red."" After ""lug,"" which produces ""blue,"" the word ""walm"" results in a repetition of ""blue,"" and then the pattern continues with ""wif"" and ""bluf,"" each producing ""red.""

- In the third example, ""dax wif walm"" results in ""green red red red."" After ""wif"" which is ""red,"" ""walm"" seems to again repeat and extend the color ""red.""

- In the fourth example, ""dax lug wif walm"" translates to ""green blue red red red,"" which seems to imply that ""walm"" again repeats and extends the prior color, which is ""red.""

- In the fifth example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue."" So ""walm"" after ""lug"" extends the ""blue"" color.

From these examples, we can induce that ""walm"" repeats and extends the color of the last word mentioned before it. Considering this information, the rule can be summarized as:

Rule: walm -> Extend the color produced by the prior word to three instances.

So if ""walm"" follows a word that outputs ""green,"" it results in ""green green green."" If it follows a word that outputs ""red,"" it results in ""red red red,"" and so on.",-0.940585361822,117,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following pattern:

1. When ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
2. When ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue.""
3. When ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red.""
4. When ""bluf"" appears, the output is ""red red.""

Now, examining the instances of ""walm"":

1. dax zup dax walm -> green yellow green green green
2. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red
3. dax wif walm -> green red red red
4. dax lug wif walm -> green blue red red red
5. lug walm -> blue blue blue

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" an extra ""green"" is added.
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" two extra ""blue"" are added.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" two extra ""red"" are added.
- ""walm"" does not seem to directly correspond to any particular color.
- ""walm"" seems to duplicate the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Hence, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it duplicates the output of the word immediately before it. If no color is associated with the preceding word (e.g., ""zup""), it does not apply or has no visible effect.

Rule: walm -> duplicates the color of the immediately preceding word in the sequence. If the preceding word has no associated color or is not known, ""walm"" does not produce any additional output.",-1.1304851941940002,117,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we will look for patterns in the inputs and corresponding outputs. Here's the breakdown:

In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" ""Walm"" appears after a repeated ""dax"" and the output repeats ""green"" for each ""dax"" and adds an extra ""green."" 

Input: dax zup dax walm
Output: green yellow green green green

In the second example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and following ""walm,"" there are two extra ""blue"" colors.

Input: lug walm wif bluf
Output: blue blue blue red red

In the third example, following ""walm,"" we see two extra ""red"" corresponding to ""wif.""

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red

In the fourth example, ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" we see two extra ""red"" again.

Input: dax lug wif walm
Output: green blue red red red

In the last example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and is immediately followed by ""walm,"" which outputs two more ""blue.""

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

Observing the patterns, ""walm"" seems to replicate the color of the word that appears immediately before it twice more. So:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word two more times.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the color that word represents is outputted two additional times.",-4.537038099715999,117,walm

2. Input: lug walm wif bluf

4. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
   
5. Input: lug walm

Let's first determine what each word could mean based on the consistent patterns:

- ""dax"" consistently correlates to ""green.""
- ""lug"" consistently correlates to ""blue.""
- ""wif"" leads to a ""red"" output.
- ""bluf"" is followed by two ""red,"" suggesting ""bluf"" may also translate to ""red.""

Now let's look at ""walm"":

In example 1 and 5, ""walm"" directly follows ""dax"" and ""lug,"" respectively, and results in a repetition of their colors. This suggests that ""walm"" might mean ""repeat the previous color.""

However, in examples 2, 3, and 4, we see ""walm"" leading to a sequence of ""red,"" but it's important to notice that in each of these cases, ""wif"" appears before ""walm."" Since ""wif"" correlates to ""red,"" it appears that ""walm"" is repeating the color ""red"" more than once after ""wif.""

Based on the information given, ""walm"" seems to have a repeating effect on the color before it. The number of repetitions seems to be two, except when following ""dax,"" in which case it repeats the color only once.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns in each output relative to its input. Here's what we can deduce from the provided examples:

1. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
   
2. Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf -> Output: blue red red green blue blue

3. Input: wif zup bluf lug -> Output: red yellow yellow blue

4. Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow

5. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Given these inputs and outputs, let's see if we can identify a pattern:

In examples 1 and 4, ""bluf"" appears after a word, and the output is the color corresponding to that word, repeated twice.

- In example 1, ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and when ""bluf"" follows, the output is ""red red.""
- In example 4, ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and with ""bluf"" following, it results in ""yellow yellow.""

In example 2, ""bluf"" appears twice, and both times it is preceded by different words (""wif"" and ""lug""). The color given for ""bluf"" is the repetition of the color that corresponds to the preceding word:

- After ""wif"" (red), ""bluf"" leads to ""red red.""
- After ""lug"" (blue), ""bluf"" leads to ""blue blue.""

In examples 3 and 5, there is ""wif zup bluf lug"" and ""wif bluf"" within another sequence, leading again to red being doubled and blue being doubled when ""bluf"" follows ""lug.""

From this, it seems that ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the output color of the word that immediately precedes it. If no word precedes ""bluf"", then no color is outputted.

"Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

Rule:
- Whenever ""walm"" is present, it takes the color of the word that follows it in the sequence. If ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence, then it takes the color of the last word before it that has a defined color.

Let's analyze the examples given using this rule:

1. ""dax walm zup lug"" results in ""green green green yellow blue""
   - ""dax"" is green, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" so it takes the color of ""zup"", which is yellow.
   - ""lug"" is independent and blue.

2. ""dax walm zup walm"" results in ""green green green yellow yellow yellow""
   - Again, ""dax"" is green, first ""walm"" takes the color of ""zup"" after it, which is yellow.
   - The second ""walm"" takes the color of the last defined color before it, which is ""zup"" (yellow).

3. ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" results in ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue""
   - ""wif"" is red, the first ""walm"" takes the color of ""dax"" after it, which is green.
   - ""wif"" and ""lug"" are red and blue respectively.
   - The last ""walm"" takes the color of the last defined color before it, which is ""lug"" (blue).

4. ""zup walm dax"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow green""
   - ""zup"" is yellow, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" so it takes the color of ""dax"", which is green.

5. ""dax wif walm lug zup"" results in ""green red red red blue yellow""
   - ""dax"" is green, ""wif"" is red.
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and so takes the color of ""lug"", which is blue.
   - ""zup"" is independent and yellow.

Therefore, the deduction is as follows:
walm -> takes the color of the following word in the sequence, or if there is no following word, it takes the color of the last word with a defined color before it.",-1.096502521722,118,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" affects the color outputs that follow it. The number of repetitions can be seen to increase with the presence of ""walm."" Analyzing each line:

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" it seems to result in ""green yellow.""
- When ""walm"" is repeated after ""zup,"" it turns ""green yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that it might be repeating the color output of the preceding word.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it results in ""red red red,"" suggesting that the output tripled the ""red"" color tied to ""wif.""
- In an instance with ""zup walm dax,"" it looks like ""walm"" doubled the ""yellow"" linked with ""zup"" before moving on to ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green.""

Therefore, the pattern suggests that ""walm"" causes the color rule of the preceding word to repeat one more time than it normally would. Considering the standard color outputs for ""dax,"" ""wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug"" seem to be green, red, yellow, and blue, respectively, without exact repetition in the absence of ""walm,"" it can be deduced that ""walm"" applies this repetition rule.

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the color output of the preceding word one additional time beyond its normal occurrence.",-7.590003833644,118,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be tied to repetition and color sequence. Each instance of the word ""walm"" corresponds to multiple occurrences of a color in the output. Additionally, each different word before ""walm"" appears to be associated with a unique color.

Here's the analysis of the examples:

- ""dax"" is consistently associated with the color green.
- ""zup"" is consistently associated with the color yellow.
- ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.
- ""wif"" is associated with the color red.

When ""walm"" follows any of these words, it results in the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

From the examples:
- ""dax walm"" resulted in ""green green green,"" indicating that one ""dax"" leads to one green and ""walm"" leads to two more greens, following the first dax.
- ""zup walm"" resulted in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that one ""zup"" leads to one yellow and ""walm"" leads to two more yellows, following the first zup.
- ""lug walm"" only appears in a context where another color is between them, but given the pattern, it can be assumed that ""lug walm"" would result in ""blue blue blue"" if such an example were available.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color associated with the preceding word twice.",-8.54854863218,118,walm
"Based on the given input and output examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color that follows the word ""walm."" In other words, ""walm"" seems to cause the next color word to repeat three times in the output. Here are the observations that lead to this rule:

- In the first example, ""dax walm zup lug,"" the word ""zup"" (which seems to correspond to ""yellow"") is repeated three times after ""walm"" is mentioned.
- In the second example, ""dax walm zup walm,"" we see ""zup"" repeated three times and then ""walm"" appears again, triggering another three repetitions of ""yellow.""
- The third example, ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm,"" shows that ""dax"" (which seems to correspond to ""green"") is repeated three times after ""walm.""
- The fourth example, ""zup walm dax,"" has ""dax"" being repeated three times after ""walm.""
- The fifth example, ""dax wif walm lug zup,"" has ""lug"" (which seems to correspond to ""blue"") being repeated once, and then ""zup"" (yellow) follows.

From these observations, the rule for ""walm"" is:

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word 'dax' corresponds to the color 'green.' Here is the reasoning:

- When 'dax' appears alone, the output is 'green.'
- Whenever 'dax' appears in the input, no matter the position, 'green' appears in the output.

However, observing the transformation of other words, we note that 'lug' likely corresponds to 'blue,' 'walm' seems to correspond to a repetition of the direct previous color, 'zup' to 'yellow,' and 'bluf' varies between green and yellow based on its position relative to 'zup' ('zup' seems to change the meaning of 'bluf'). 'wif' seems to correspond to 'red.'

For example:
- 'lug dax walm' translates to 'blue green green green,' where 'walm' repeats the color 'green' from 'dax.'
- 'lug dax zup dax walm wif' translates to 'blue green yellow green green green red,' where 'walm' repeats the color 'green' again, and 'wif' gives 'red.'

4. Input: dax bluf zup | Output: green green yellow
5. Input: dax zup bluf | Output: green yellow yellow

Here are key observations:

- Every time the input contains ""dax,"" the output includes ""green."" This suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- The words ""lug"" and ""walm"" appear to consistently correspond to ""blue"" and ""red,"" respectively, or in the case of ""walm,"" multiple ""green"" (perhaps the quantity of ""green"" that follows ""dax"" is related to context or other words present, which we will ignore for the purpose of deducing the meaning of ""dax"").
- The word ""zup"" appears always to correspond to ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when preceded by ""dax"" or ""zup"" but to ""green"" when alone after ""dax."" This suggests its output color may be influenced by the preceding word.

Considering these observations, the rule for ""dax"" appears to be consistent and is not influenced by the position nor the presence of other words. Thus, based on the above examples, the rule can be deduced as follows:

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green."" It seems that ""dax"" is independent of its position in the sentence and does not change its meaning when combined with different words. Therefore, the rule can be outlined as follows:

Therefore, the rule can be written as:

"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we must identify the pattern associated with its output across different inputs:

- When the input was only ""wif,"" the output was ""red.""
- When the input was ""wif bluf,"" the output was ""red red,"" which suggests ""bluf"" also translates to ""red.""
- When the input included ""wif"" among other words, ""wif"" was consistently translated to ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
- The presence of ""wif"" in different contexts with different words didn't change its corresponding output; it was always ""red.""

3. ""dax zup"" -> ""green yellow""
4. ""wif zup walm dax zup"" -> ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow""
5. ""dax zup"" -> ""green yellow""

From examples 3 and 5 which are both ""dax zup"" -> ""green yellow,"" we can see that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" immediately following the word ""dax,"" which translates to ""green.""

Looking at example 1, ""bluf"" translates to ""red,"" and since we are seeing ""zup"" translate to ""yellow"" when following ""bluf,"" we have preliminary evidence to suggest that ""zup"" alone may denote ""yellow.""

In example 2, ""zup"" is preceded by ""bluf"" and followed by ""lug,"" with ""zup"" producing ""yellow"" again. Given that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""bluf"" to ""red,"" we have further confirmation that ""zup"" does not change its output based on the preceding word.

Finally, example 4 shows ""zup"" generating ""yellow"" irrespective of being preceded by ""wif"" (red) or followed by ""dax"" (green) or ""walm."" Since ""walm"" translates to ""yellow"" as well, the repetition of the word ""yellow"" suggests ""zup"" is not influenced by adjacent words in this context either.

5. ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue,"" indicating that the first ""bluf"" mirrors ""dax"" (green), and the second ""bluf"" mirrors ""zup"" (yellow).

Input 1: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the word after ""bluf"" is ""green,"" which is also the color corresponding to ""dax.""
Input 2: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and the word after ""bluf"" is ""blue,"" which is also the color corresponding to ""lug.""
Input 3: Both occurrences of ""bluf,"" follow ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup,"" corresponding to ""yellow,"" respectively. The word after each ""bluf"" is the color corresponding to the word right before them.

- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red; when followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""red"" twice.
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, but when ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""red"" instead of ""blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" doesn't duplicate blue but instead outputs red.

However, when ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" it does not result in an output color that corresponds to it directly (like ""yellow"" or ""red""), suggesting that ""bluf"" does not have a consistent color association in this position. Yet, when considering ""lug bluf lug,"" it translates to ""blue red blue,"" it indicates that in this case ""bluf"" may translate to ""red."" But to add to the complexity, ""wif bluf lug"" results in ""red red blue,"" and here, ""bluf"" is again followed by a ""lug,"" but the resulting color is ""red,"" not ""blue.""

Therefore, it is challenging to determine a consistent rule for ""bluf"" based on these examples because its meaning seems to change depending on the context. However, if we focus primarily on its position after certain words (""zup"" and ""wif""), we can tentatively deduce the following rules:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it translates to ""yellow.""
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it translates to ""red.""

Rule: 

- ""bluf"" -> ""yellow"" when following ""zup""

Therefore, we deduce that ""bluf"" translates to different colors depending on the context -- which word immediately precedes or follows it.

- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" or stands alone, the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""

Hence, the rule might be that ""bluf"" by itself means yellow, but its meaning changes based on the preceding or following word.

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" appears to precede a list of other nonce words, and the output always starts with the word ""blue."" This consistent starting point suggests that ""lug"" indicates the initiation of a sequence in which ""lug"" itself translates to ""blue."" Each subsequent nonce word then corresponds to a specific color, for example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""blue.""

Thus, the rule I can deduce is as follows:

Rule: ""lug"" serves as a marker or indicator exerting its own meaning as ""blue,"" and proceeds to affect the translation of subsequent words into specific colors. Each occurrence of ""lug"" resets the sequence, again representing ""blue.""",-4.6670199016580005,122,lug
"Based on the provided examples, it seems like ""lug"" functions as an instruction that affects the output's first color—specifically, making the first color of the output ""blue"" each time it is mentioned. After ""lug,"" the colors seem to be associated with specific words.

Let's look at the non-""lug"" words and their corresponding colors:

- ""walm"" -> blue
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""bluf"" -> blue
- ""dax"" -> green

Analyzing the patterns:

- Whenever ""lug"" is introduced, the first color after it is ""blue.""
- Each word following ""lug"" is mapped to a specific color, with ""walm,"" ""bluf,"" and ""dax"" leading to blue, green, and red respectively.
- The sequence of words after ""lug"" does not seem to influence the color ""blue"" that ""lug"" imposes on its following output.

Here is the rule based on the above observations:

Rule: When the word ""lug"" precedes any word, it converts the next output color to ""blue,"" regardless of the color normally associated with the following word. Subsequent output colors correspond to the specific word-color mappings listed above.",-5.78332945685,122,lug
"Rule: lug -> blue

This rule is deduced from the consistent presence of ""blue"" at the beginning of each output string, corresponding to the presence of the word ""lug"" at the beginning of each input string.",-7.780264441057999,122,lug
Rule: lug -> blue.,-9.609349796205999,122,lug
"Based on the examples given, the word ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green."" It appears that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. The following are the associations that can be made from the data:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> blue (though ""bluf"" isn't directly shown in the examples, it contains ""blu"" which seems to correspond to the color blue)
- walm -> yellow (indicated by repeated occurrences resulting in the color yellow)

Rule: Each nonce word represents a unique color. ""Dax"" in particular represents the color green.",-4.94453500554,122,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer a potential rule for what each word in the input correlates to in terms of color in the output.

Looking at instances where ""dax"" appears:

1. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
2. When ""dax"" is in a sequence with other words such as ""zup"" and ""wif,"" it still corresponds to ""green,"" while ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" is ""red.""
3. Despite the order and other words included, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green.""
4. Even when ""dax"" is paired with just one other word (""lug""), it corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
5. When ""dax"" appears after ""wif"" and before ""zup,"" it still corresponds to ""green.""

Thus, we induce that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" independent of the word order or the presence of other words. The other words seem to have their own color associations as well, such as ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" seems to repeat the previously mentioned color (for instance, ""yellow"" from ""zup"").

Rule: dax -> green",-6.206656816394,122,dax
"Based on the provided examples, each nonce word appears to correspond to a specific color. In all instances, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green.

dax -> meaning.

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.",-9.21710159346,122,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following:

- Whenever the input is ""dax"" on its own, the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is in a sequence with other words, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""

Considering the positions of ""dax"" and the corresponding output of ""green"" regardless of the position in the sequence or the words around it, we can induce that the word ""dax"" directly corresponds to the color ""green"" and is not context-dependent in these examples.

Rule: dax -> green.",-9.354758260619999,122,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we will look at each instance where it is used and the corresponding output:

1. When only the word ""dax"" is input, the output is ""green.""
2. When ""dax"" is used in combination with other words, it consistently results in the color ""green"" in the output sequence, no matter the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence.

Given the evidence provided, we can conclude that:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, independent of its position in the input sequence.",-9.6147781757,122,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we will compare the inputs with the corresponding outputs. Let's analyze the examples.

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

   - When ""wif"" is the first word, the output is ""red.""
   - The word ""lug"" appears twice and corresponds to ""blue"" both times.
   - ""dax"" is last and corresponds to ""green.""

2. Input: dax wif lug dax
   Output: green red blue green

   - ""dax"" at the beginning corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""wif"" now is second and corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""lug"" still corresponds to ""blue.""

3. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue

   - ""wif"" again is first and corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

4. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green

   - ""wif"" is at the beginning and corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

5. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
   
   - ""dax"" at the beginning corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - ""wif"" is now third and corresponds to ""red.""

From the examples, it can be seen that regardless of its position in the input sequence, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" in the output sequence.

Rule: wif -> red",-6.598184198575001,122,wif
"By examining the examples provided, we can attempt to infer the meaning of ""wif"" by looking at its correspondence to colors in the output.

1. In ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"", ""wif"" is paired with ""red"", and ""lug"" appears three times after ""wif"", each resulting in a ""blue"". ""dax"" occurs next and is paired with ""green"". 
2. In ""dax wif lug dax"", the ""wif"" is again followed by ""lug"", which results in a ""red"" followed by a ""blue"". ""dax"", in both cases, matches with ""green"".
3. For ""wif lug"", it's clear that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"".
4. In ""wif dax bluf"", ""wif"" again maps to ""red"", and ""dax"" twice maps to ""green"". 
5. Finally, ""dax lug wif walm"" is a bit more complex. Here ""dax"" is ""green"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""wif"" is ""red"", and ""walm"" is ""red"" as well.

Comparing across all examples, one consistent pattern emerges: regardless of the context or the position in the sequence, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"". Therefore, we can infer the rule:

Rule: wif -> red",-6.949829974445999,122,wif
"Based upon the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" directly corresponds to the color ""red."" This is suggested by its consistent mapping across all examples, where each instance of ""wif"" is translated to ""red"" regardless of the position or the surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red.",-10.135316234160001,122,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds directly to the color ""red."" Here's how that deduction works:

- In each example where ""wif"" is present, the output produces the color ""red.""
- ""wif"" doesn't appear to alter or affect the output of the words following it, as they are consistent with their own color outputs (based on the given context).
- ""wif"" only affects the output where it is located, always producing the color ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

wif -> red. The meaning of ""wif"" is the color ""red.""",-10.18785582832,122,wif
"Based on the given examples, each appearance of the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. It does not seem to depend on any context or adjacent words; its meaning is consistent each time it appears. Therefore, we can deduce the following:

"zup -> yellow

"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the sequence.",-6.751731644194,122,zup
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" dictates repeating the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here's how we can derive the rule:

- In the first example, ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"" and ""dax"" with ""green."" Since ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" the output is ""blue green green.""

- In the second example, ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"" and ""lug"" with ""blue."" ""Bluf"" comes after ""lug,"" so the output is ""yellow blue blue.""

- In the third example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" With ""bluf"" coming after ""zup,"" the output is ""green yellow yellow.""

- In the fourth example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" Followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue red red.""

- In the fifth example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" isn't associated with a color, ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""wif"" with ""red."" Since ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" and the last instance of ""lug"" was prior to ""wif,"" the output reflects this as ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red.""

So, ""bluf"" means repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the word just before ""bluf"" in the output sequence.",-1.060502327132,122,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to repeating the color of the previous word in the sequence twice. 

- In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""dax"" to green. Following ""bluf,"" the color green is repeated twice.
- In the second example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, and ""bluf"" causes the blue to be repeated twice.
- In the third example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""bluf"" results in yellow being repeated twice.
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" to red, and ""bluf"" makes red repeat twice.
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""walm"" also to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, ""wif"" to red, and ""bluf"" causes red to be repeated.

Thus, bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it two times.",-3.8768473119039997,122,bluf
"bluf -> repetition of the color associated with the previous word. 

Rule: The word ""bluf"" causes the color word that comes before it to be repeated. For example, in the first input ""lug dax bluf,"" the word ""lug"" is associated with blue and ""dax"" with green. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the color ""green"" associated with ""dax"" is repeated, resulting in ""blue green green."" Similarly, in the input ""zup lug bluf,"" the word ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""bluf"" causes the output ""blue"" to be repeated. This pattern continues consistently across all examples.",-5.593849973326,122,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce that the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the following pattern:

- The first word determines the first color in the output.
- The second word determines the second color in the output.
- When the word ""bluf"" appears, the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" is repeated.

Let's look at the examples to see the pattern:

1. Input: lug dax bluf
   Output: blue green green
   The word ""lug"" represents blue, ""dax"" represents green, and ""bluf"" causes the preceding color (green) to be repeated.

2. Input: zup lug bluf
   Output: yellow blue blue
   Here, ""zup"" represents yellow, ""lug"" represents blue, and ""bluf"" causes the preceding color (blue) to be repeated.

3. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   In this case, ""dax"" represents green, ""zup"" represents yellow, and ""bluf"" causes the preceding color (yellow) to be repeated.

4. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
   Here, ""lug"" represents blue, ""wif"" represents red, and ""bluf"" causes the preceding color (red) to be repeated.

5. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   In this longer sequence, ""zup"" represents yellow, ""walm"" is also yellow, ""lug"" represents blue, ""wif"" represents red, and ""bluf"" causes the preceding color (red) to be repeated.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

bluf -> meaning. Rule: When ""bluf"" appears in the sequence, repeat the color represented by the word immediately before ""bluf"".",-5.905295467596001,122,bluf
"bluf -> repeat the color that comes before bluf twice.

Rule: When you see the word ""bluf"" in the input, the output will be the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"", repeated twice.",-6.522254773039999,122,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce that ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the word that comes directly before it. 

Rules seen from the examples:

1. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue,"" with ""zup"" being associated with the color yellow, and the number of ""yellow"" words being one more than the number of ""walm"" words.
2. ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" is associated with the color blue, and there are two ""walm"" words after ""lug,"" resulting in two additional blues.
3. ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" is ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow."" ""wif"" is associated with red, and ""walm"" repeats this color three times, while ""zup"" is associated with yellow, which is again repeated three times after a single occurrence of ""walm.""
4. ""wif walm dax zup"" turns into ""red red red green yellow."" The pattern of repeating the color of the preceding word is consistent.
5. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" results in ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow."" Once again, ""zup"" is associated with yellow, which is repeated three times due to the single occurrence of ""walm"" after it.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the directly preceding word. If the preceding word's color is unknown, this rule cannot apply.",-1.275153587582,122,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" by analyzing the patterns of colors associated with different words in the input and output sequences:

Input: zup walm lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
- Here ""zup"" results in ""yellow"", ""lug"" results in ""blue"", and ""walm"" has produced two ""yellow"" colors in a row.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- In this case, ""dax"" results in ""green"", ""lug"" gives us ""blue"", and ""walm"" again results in multiples of the previous color, which is ""blue"".

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
- ""dax"" gives ""green"", ""wif"" gives ""red"", ""lug"" gives ""blue"", ""zup"" gives ""yellow"". ""walm"" repeats the color immediately before it multiple times.

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
- ""wif"" gives ""red"", ""dax"" gives ""green"", ""zup"" gives ""yellow"". Again, ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif"".

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
- ""lug"" gives ""blue"", ""wif"" gives ""red"", ""dax"" gives ""green"", ""zup"" gives ""yellow"". ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup"".

Based on these observations, we can reasonably conclude that ""walm"" results in the output of the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word being repeated multiple times. The exact number of repetitions seems to be based on the last color produced before the appearance of ""walm"".

Rule: walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word multiple times, where the number of repetitions seems to be dependent on the specific context or sequence.",-5.931720235854,122,walm
"By examining the input and output sequences, we can determine the meaning of the word ""walm.""

Input: zup walm lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
- ""zup"" leads to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" leads to ""blue""
- ""walm"" occurrence with ""yellow"" before ""blue""

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- ""dax"" leads to ""green""
- ""lug"" leads to ""blue""
- ""walm"" occurrence with ""blue"" before multiple ""blue""

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm

- ""dax"" leads to ""green""
- ""wif"" leads to ""red""
- ""lug"" leads to ""blue""
- ""zup"" leads to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" occurrence with ""red"" before ""blue"" and another with ""yellow"" after ""blue""

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
- ""wif"" leads to ""red""
- ""dax"" leads to ""green""
- ""zup"" leads to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" occurrence with ""red"" before ""green"" and ""yellow""

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
- ""lug"" leads to ""blue""
- ""wif"" leads to ""red""
- ""dax"" leads to ""green""
- ""zup"" leads to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" occurrence with all colors before ""yellow"" thrice

From these examples, we can derive the following rule:

Rule: Walm -> The color directly preceding ""walm"" is repeated three times.

Examples to support the rule:
- In each case, the output color before ""walm"" is the same and is repeated exactly three times after ""walm.""
- No other pattern seems to fit the provided data.

So, based on the given examples, we can define ""walm"" as follows:

Walm -> The color word immediately before ""walm"" in the input is translated to that color repeated three times in the output.",-6.9106412963300015,122,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's observe its usage and the corresponding output in each example. 

Example 1:
Input: zup walm lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue

Example 2:
Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Example 3:
Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm

Example 4:
Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Example 5:
Input: lug wif dax zup walm

Analyzing the Inputs with respect to their corresponding Outputs:

- In example 1, ""walm"" corresponds to three repetitions of ""yellow.""
- In example 2, ""walm"" corresponds to three repetitions of ""blue.""
- In example 3, ""walm"" appears twice, first corresponding to three repetitions of ""red,"" then two repetitions of ""yellow.""
- In example 4, ""walm"" corresponds to three repetitions of ""red.""
- In example 5, ""walm"" corresponds to three repetitions of ""yellow.""

From these observations, it is clear that ""walm"" represents a repetition of the color word that directly precedes it. It repeats the color three times if ""walm"" immediately follows the color word and two times if there's one word in between.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last color word mentioned three times if it immediately follows the color word, and repeat the last color word two times if there's one word in between.",-10.652286672505,122,walm

In the second example:
Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
Output: blue red red green blue blue

In the third example:

- In every instance where ""lug"" appears, ""blue"" appears in the output.
- ""lug"" does not seem to correlate with a position change in the pattern, meaning its placement in the input does not seem to affect the positioning of ""blue"" in the output (it's not like ""blue"" appears immediately after the word ""lug"" every time).
- ""lug"" does not seem to depend on the words around it; no matter what other words precede or follow ""lug,"" ""blue"" is in the output.

"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's examine the context in which it is used and its related outputs:

1. ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue""
2. ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green""
3. ""zup dax walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow green green green blue red""
4. ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" translates to ""blue green green yellow blue red""
5. ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue"" again.

Looking at examples 1 and 5, which are exactly the same, it seems that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" This is further supported by the initial ""wif"" in examples 2 and 4, where the first color in the output is also ""red.""

Now, let's consider the position of 'wif' in each sequence. 

In examples 1 and 5, ""wif"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the output is ""red blue."" In example 3, ""wif"" is at the end, following ""lug,"" and the output ends with ""blue red"". Similarly, in example 4, which ends with ""wif,"" the output also ends with ""red."" This suggests that ""wif"" does not change meaning based on its position in the sequence.

The color that appears after ""red"" in the output seems to depend on the word that follows ""wif."" In every output, the color that comes after ""red"" is the color that the word after ""wif"" translates to. For example:

- ""lug"" always translates to ""blue.""
- ""bluf"" always translates to ""red.""
- ""dax"" always translates to ""green.""

Therefore, it seems that ""wif"" itself translates to ""red,"" and the word following ""wif"" maintains its corresponding color in the output sequence.

Rule: wif -> red",-1.03040599176,123,wif
"From the given examples, we can infer that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Let's verify this with each example:

- ""wif lug"" yields ""red blue."" If ""wif"" is red, this is consistent since ""lug"" appears in other examples that output ""blue.""
  
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" yields ""red red green green green."" Here, ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red."" The repetition of ""red"" might suggest that ""bluf"" also means ""red,"" while ""dax"" and ""walm"" seem to correspond with ""green.""
  
- ""zup dax walm lug wif"" yields ""yellow green green green blue red."" In this sequence, ""wif"" at the end corresponds to ""red,"" which matches the established meaning. The other colors can be correlated with the other words based on previous examples.
  
- ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" yields ""blue green green yellow blue red."" Again, ""wif"" is the last word and translates as ""red"" at the end of the sequence. Other colors follow the pattern based on their corresponding words.

Output: red red
Rule: In this case, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" and the output is ""red red."" This suggests that ""bluf"" takes on the color that precedes it, which is ""red.""

3. Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
Rule: Here ""bluf"" comes after a sequence of ""zup"" and ""lug,"" and the output ends in ""yellow yellow."" Since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is the word directly preceding ""bluf,"" it appears that ""bluf"" again assumes the color value of the word before it, which is ""yellow.""

4. Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
Rule: ""Bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow,"" which supports the idea that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word, ""yellow"" in this case.

5. Input: zup lug bluf
Output: yellow blue blue
Rule: The sequence ""zup lug bluf"" results in ""yellow blue blue."" This is an interesting case because although ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue,"" the appearance of ""bluf"" duplicates the color ""blue"" that comes just before it. This suggests that not only does ""bluf"" take on the color before it, but it also repeats it.

From these examples, we can infer that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it and also duplicates it. The general rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" appears to be as follows:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word and repeats it.",-4.445966545577001,123,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce a rule for what ""bluf"" means:

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green

Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

Input: zup lug bluf
Output: yellow blue blue

From these examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Let's check this against the examples:

1. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and following ""wif bluf,"" we have ""red red.""
2. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and following ""dax bluf,"" we have ""green green.""
3. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" When the sequence ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" is given, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (""yellow""), resulting in ""yellow yellow.""

5. In ""zup lug bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (""blue""), resulting in ""blue blue.""

Based on these observations, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be:

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we look at the pattern of words and their corresponding colors:

From the first input-output pair:
- The word ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green.""
- The word ""wif"" correlates with the color ""green"" when followed by ""walm"" but ""red"" otherwise.
- The word ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow.""

In the occurrences of ""walm"":
1. ""dax walm wif walm zup"" -> green green green red red red yellow 
   - After ""walm,"" the next word changes its color: ""wif"" changes from its usual red to green after being preceded by ""walm.""
2. ""dax walm wif dax"" -> green green green red green
   - ""wif"" is red as usual because it is not preceded directly by ""walm.""
3. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" -> red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   - The first ""wif"" is red, then ""lug"" and ""zup"" follow their usual pattern, but after ""walm"" ""wif"" changes to yellow instead of its usual red.
4. ""dax walm zup"" -> green green green yellow 
   - The pattern holds with ""zup"" following its usual yellow after ""walm.""
5. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" -> blue red yellow red red red
   - ""wif"" is usually red and remains red before and after ""walm.""

From the above observations, ""walm"" does not seem to have a consistent direct correlation with a specific color. Instead, ""walm"" appears to affect the color associated with the word that follows it. The rule seems to be that when ""walm"" precedes a word, it changes the usual color association of the subsequent word. In examples 2 and 3, ""wif"" changes color when it follows ""walm,"" although the particular color it changes to varies (green in the first case, yellow in the second), which suggests that more context might be needed to fully understand ""walm."" Since example 3 provides a new coloration (yellow) for ""wif"" that isn't consistent with the earlier pattern, it complicates the induction of a simple rule.

Given the data, ""walm"" could indicate a modifier that changes the color association of the following word, or it could signal a more complex pattern that requires further context to decipher fully. However, with the data provided, a clear and consistent definition of ""walm"" cannot be confidently established.

Rule: ""walm"" seems to act as a modifier that changes the usual color association of the subsequent word, although the exact change is not consistently indicated across the examples.",-0.898585116682,123,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to the repeating of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Let's review the evidence from the examples:

1. ""dax walm wif walm zup"" yields ""green green green red red red yellow."" Here ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which maps to ""green,"" resulting in repeated ""greens."" Again, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which maps to ""red,"" resulting in repeated ""reds.""

2. ""dax walm wif dax"" yields ""green green green red green."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" resulting in two additional ""greens.""

3. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" yields ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which maps to ""yellow,"" resulting in two additional ""yellows.""

4. ""dax walm zup"" yields ""green green green yellow."" Again, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" resulting in two additional ""greens.""

5. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" yields ""blue red yellow red red red."" In this case, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which maps to ""red,"" resulting in two additional ""reds.""

Based on these observations, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" repeats the color that is associated with the word right before it.

Therefore:

walm -> Repeats the color associated with the preceding word.",-1.019552998994,123,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the examples given and identify patterns in the inputs and outputs.

1. dax walm wif walm zup -> green green green red red red yellow
2. dax walm wif dax -> green green green red green
3. wif lug zup walm wif lug -> red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
4. dax walm zup -> green green green yellow
5. lug wif zup wif walm -> blue red yellow red red red

When examining the outputs and how they correspond to the inputs, it is apparent that the presence of the word ""walm"" affects the output colors. Specifically:

- In example 1, when ""walm"" first appears, it is followed by ""wif walm,"" resulting in ""green red red red."" ""Walm"" seems to initiate a sequence of reds that ends when a different word (""zup"" in this case) appears.
  
- In example 2, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif dax,"" resulting in ""green red green."" The appearance of ""dax"" after ""wif"" seems to break from the sequence initiated by ""walm,"" suggesting that ""dax"" brings back the green.
  
- In example 3, ""walm"" is surrounded by different words, resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow."" This is consistent with the idea that ""wif"" before ""walm"" leads to repetition of the color corresponding to ""wif"" (in this case, yellow, which is the output associated with ""wif"").
  
- In example 4, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" resulting in ""green yellow."" This shows that ""zup"" changes the color as well.
  
- In example 5, ""walm"" comes after two repetitions of ""wif"" and gives us three ""red."" Again, the ""walm"" seems to initiate a repetition but there's not enough data to fully determine if the number of repetitions after ""walm"" is affected by how many times the preceding word appears.

Based on this analysis, ""walm"" appears to begin a sequence of identical colors. In the case where ""wif"" occurs directly before ""walm,"" that color is red and may even prolong the sequence. Also, it seems that ""wif"" by itself results in the color red, and ""dax"" by itself results in the color green. The word that follows ""walm"" can interrupt the sequence.

Therefore, a tentative rule for ""walm"" could be that it initiates or prolongs a sequence of the previous color, especially when preceded by ""wif,"" until a different input word appears to disrupt the sequence.

Rule: walm -> initiates or prolongs a sequence of the color corresponding to the word directly before it until a different word appears.",-1.037468955246,123,walm
"The word ""walm"" appears to specify the color green each time it precedes another word, and it seems to repeat the color of the last word when following a sequence of words. Also, ""walm"" not only replicates the last color once, but it seems to repeat the color three times.

Looking carefully at the examples:

1. ""dax walm wif walm zup"" -> ""green green green red red red yellow""
   - ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" and leads to ""green green green"".
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" and leads to ""red red red"".
   - ""zup"" is alone and translates to ""yellow"".

2. ""dax walm wif dax"" -> ""green green green red green""
   - ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" results in ""green green green"".
   - ""wif"" following this pattern is ""red"".
   - ""dax"" at the end is ""green"".

3. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" -> ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue""
   - ""wif"" is ""red"".
   - ""lug"" is ""blue"".
   - ""zup"" is ""yellow"".
   - ""walm"" after ""zup"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"".
   - ""wif"" following this pattern is ""red"".
   - ""lug"" at the end is again ""blue"".

4. ""dax walm zup"" -> ""green green green yellow""
   - ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" results in ""green green green"".
   - ""zup"" at the end is ""yellow"".

5. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" -> ""blue red yellow red red red""
   - ""lug"" at the beginning is ""blue"".
   - ""wif"" is ""red"".
   - ""zup"" is ""yellow"".
   - another ""wif"" is again ""red"".
   - ""walm"" after this last ""wif"" results in ""red red red"".

Based on the examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be: when ""walm"" precedes a word, that word is translated to ""green"", and when it follows one or more words, it repeats the color of the last word three times.

Rule: walm -> When preceding, it means ""green."" When following, it repeats the color of the last word three times.",-1.117022776814,123,walm
"Given the examples, walm seems to be a rule that causes the color green to be repeated preceding the occurrence of walm, and red to be repeated following it. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""dax walm wif walm zup"" outputs ""green green green red red red yellow"". Before and after the first occurrence of walm, green is repeated three times and after the second walm, red is repeated three times until a different color (yellow) is introduced, indicating a change due to ""zup"".

- In the second example, ""dax walm wif dax"", we see ""green green green"" (for ""dax walm""), followed by ""red"" (because of walm), and the sequence ends with ""green"" for the second ""dax"" without another walm to extend the red sequence.

- The third example, ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"", gives us a sequence where walm is preceded by a yellow (which doesn't follow the previous pattern), but after walm ""wif lug"" sequence is repeated once again as ""yellow red blue,"" implying that walm simply restarted the sequence rather than imposing a color rule in this case.

- The fourth example, ""dax walm zup"", illustrates again the green repetition, ""green green green,"" prior to ""walm"" and a single yellow following ""zup"".

- The fifth example, ""lug wif zup wif walm"", shows the beginning sequence ""blue red yellow red,"" and following ""walm"" we see ""red red red,"" indicating that ""walm"" causes the color red to repeat.

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" initiates a repetition of the color green before it and changes to a repetition of the color red after it until a new color is introduced or the sequence ends.

We can determine the rule by examining how the output color changes when bluf is used:

1. lug wif lug bluf results in blue red blue blue - Here, bluf follows lug (which corresponds to blue) and the output is also blue.

2. lug wif dax bluf wif lug results in blue red green green red blue - Here, bluf follows dax (green) and the output is green.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs:

- When ""lug walm"" is input, the output is ""blue blue blue."" This suggests that ""lug"" corresponds to a single ""blue,"" and ""walm"" to a repetition of ""blue.""

- In the second example, ""zup bluf lug zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" has not been mentioned in other examples but in this context, it still results in ""blue"" (same as ""lug""), and we see ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of ""yellow,"" the color associated with ""zup.""

- The third input, ""zup wif dax walm lug,"" corresponds to ""yellow red green green green blue."" Here, we can see ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" results in repeating the color that precedes it (""green"" in this case).

- In ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm,"" the output is ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue."" Each instance of ""walm"" causes the preceding color word (""wif"" for ""red"" and ""lug"" for ""blue"") to be repeated.

- Finally, ""dax walm wif"" results in ""green green green red."" Here again, ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""walm"" results in ""green"" being repeated.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color word that comes before it.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the correspondence between the inputs and the outputs in each example.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

Here, 'lug' corresponds to 'blue' followed by 'walm,' which also corresponds to 'blue.'

Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow 

In this example, 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow,' 'bluf' does not affect 'yellow,' 'lug' corresponds to 'blue,' but after 'walm,' the output is 'yellow' instead of 'blue.'

Input: zup wif dax walm lug 
Output: yellow red green green green blue

Here, 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow,' 'wif' to 'red,' 'dax' to 'green,' and after 'walm,' the sequence 'green green' repeats before 'lug' outputs 'blue.'

Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

In this case, 'wif' corresponds to 'red,' and 'walm' appears to repeat the color 'red' twice. 'Dax' corresponds to 'green,' 'zup' to 'yellow,' 'wif' again to 'red,' and 'lug' to 'blue.' After the second 'walm,' the color 'blue' is repeated twice.

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red

'Dax' corresponds to 'green,' and after 'walm,' 'green' appears two more times before 'wif' gives 'red.'

Rule: walm -> meaning.

Based on the provided examples, 'walm' appears to duplicate the color output of the word that precedes it twice. If 'walm' follows a word that outputs a certain color, the meaning of 'walm' is to output that color twice more.

Meaning: Walm repeats the color output of the preceding word twice.",-9.786673032051,124,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at how it maps to the outputs provided:

1. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

2. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

3. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue

4. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

5. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red

When observing how ""walm"" affects the output, it seems that each occurrence of ""walm"" generates a sequence of colors that match the last single color mentioned before ""walm."" There is a repetition of this color depending on some rule we need to deduce based on the other words' outputs.

Let's try to identify a pattern by comparing the examples:

1. When ""lug"" is mentioned before ""walm,"" the output sequence is ""blue blue blue.""
2. ""walm"" follows ""dax"" in examples 3 and 5, and in each case, the color ""green"" is repeated three times before moving to the next sequence that matches ""lug"" in example 3, which is ""blue.""
3. In example 4, ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" and the output is three times ""red.""
4. In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output sequence is three ""yellow,"" which are preceded by a ""blue"" from the word ""lug.""

It seems that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color output of the last word before ""walm"", and the number of repetitions is three based on all provided examples.

So, we can conclude the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.",-10.271525185048999,124,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look closely at the outputs in correspondence with the input containing ""walm."" Considering the colors produced in the Output, let's try to find a pattern.

- Every time ""walm"" appears, the Output is a repetition of one color.
- The number of repetitions matches the number of words preceding ""walm.""

For example:
- In ""lug walm,"" there is one word before ""walm,"" so the output is ""blue"" once.
- In ""zup bluf lug zup walm,"" there are four words before ""walm,"" so the output is ""yellow"" repeated four times.

Additionally, looking at the other words, it seems each one corresponds to a specific color:
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""dax"" -> green

Following this pattern, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it, for the number of words that have been listed before ""walm."" For ""walm"" to stand alone with a meaning independent of context, it should mean ""repeat the color of the preceding word."" But since ""walm"" depends on the preceding word for the specific color, we can't assign it a standalone color. Thus, the general rule for ""walm"" would be repetition based on the preceding context.

- Input: wif zup dax bluf -> Output: red yellow green green (wif is the first word and corresponds to red)
- Input: lug dax wif -> Output: blue green red (wif is the third word and corresponds to red)
- Input: zup dax wif -> Output: yellow green red (wif is the third word and corresponds to red)
- Input: zup wif bluf zup lug -> Output: yellow red red yellow blue (wif is the second word and corresponds to red)

- In the third example, ""wif"" appears yet again with ""red"" as the output.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" appears and ""red"" is the output for it.
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" is associated with ""red"" once more.

In each instance, regardless of which words precede or follow ""wif,"" the word ""wif"" correlates directly to the color ""red."" The other words in the examples correspond to different colors consistently (e.g., ""lug"" always corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green"").

"Looking at the patterns in the given examples, the task is to ascertain the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" based on the other words' outputs.

Let's analyze each input and associated output:

1. ""dax walm wif walm zup"" -> ""green green green red red red yellow""
2. ""zup dax wif"" -> ""yellow green red""
3. ""zup bluf dax"" -> ""yellow yellow green""
4. ""wif walm zup walm"" -> ""red red red yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax"" -> ""red red yellow red blue green""

From these examples, we see the following:
- ""dax"" is always converting to ""green"".
- ""wif"" is always converting to ""red"".
- ""bluf"" seems to always convert to ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup"" and to ""blue"" in other contexts.
- ""lug"" is always converting to ""blue"".
- ""zup"" results in outputs that are exactly repeated colors from previous terms, always ending with ""yellow"".

Given this, it's reasonable to infer that ""zup"" could mean ""repeat the preceding colors (or possibly words) followed by a yellow"".

So if we convert this into a rule, we get:

zup -> Repeat the preceding colors (or output pattern) in sequence until a yellow is reached.

This rule seems consistent with all provided examples. If ""zup"" always had to be followed by a ""yellow"", it would explain why there is always a yellow at the end of the outputs containing ""zup"". The repetition of the preceding colors before the yellow in the output for the inputs containing ""zup"" seems to confirm this rule.",-1.1117956324920002,125,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" in the context of these examples, I will look for patterns in the corresponding outputs. Here's how each input correlates with its output:

1. ""dax walm wif walm zup"" -> ""green green green red red red yellow""
2. ""zup dax wif"" -> ""yellow green red""
3. ""zup bluf dax"" -> ""yellow yellow green""
4. ""wif walm zup walm"" -> ""red red red yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax"" -> ""red red yellow red blue green""

After examining the examples:

- It seems that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""bluf"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
- When ""zup"" appears in an input, ""yellow"" appears in the output.
- Additionally, after ""zup"" appears, the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""zup"" is repeated three times in the output.

From these observations, the rule appears to be:

**Rule:** The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" and when ""zup"" is used, it signals a repetition of three of the color that the word immediately before it represents.

Therefore:
zup -> ""yellow"" and indicates to repeat the preceding color three times.",-1.268657074128,125,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look at the patterns and how the word ""zup"" affects the output:

1. When ""zup"" follows ""walm,"" the color ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
2. When ""zup"" follows ""wif,"" the color ""red"" is repeated.
3. When ""zup"" precedes ""dax,"" the color ""green"" follows it, but not in repetition.
4. When ""zup"" is at the beginning, it results in ""yellow.""

Now, analyzing the patterns:

- Input: ""walm"" consistently translates to ""green,"" except when followed by ""zup,"" after which it translates to ""yellow.""
- Input: ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- Input: ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- Input: ""bluf"" leads to ""yellow"" when it comes after ""zup,"" but translates to ""blue"" in the presence of ""lug.""

The key observation is that ""zup"" seems to affect the output after it. When ""zup"" is positioned before a color word, it makes the output repeat the corresponding color for the following word three times. However, when it follows a color word, it changes the next color output to ""yellow."" 

From this, we can conclude that ""zup"" is a modifier that changes the way the following word is expressed in the output. More specifically, ""zup"" causes the next word's output color to repeat three times if the word has a corresponding color, or it changes the next color to ""yellow"" if ""zup"" follows a word.

Rule:
zup -> Causes the next word's output color to repeat three times or changes the following color to ""yellow"" if ""zup"" follows a word.",-7.57275533902,125,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems like the nonce word ""zup"" is used to transition from one color to the next in a sequence.

Here's what we can deduce from the provided examples:

1. The sequence appears to follow this pattern: ""dax"" is associated with green, ""wif"" is associated with red, ""bluf"" might be associated with yellow given its pairing with ""zup"". 

2. When ""zup"" appears, the color that follows is repeated for a series of times equal to the number of repetitions of the color that precedes it.

Let's test this rule with the examples:

- In the first example, ""dax walm wif walm zup,"" ""dax"" (green) is followed by ""walm"" which hasn't been associated with any color, but then ""wif"" (red) follows and is then repeated two more times followed by ""zup"" which leads to a series of a different color, yellow, as many times as ""wif"" appeared before ""zup"" which is three times.
  
- In the third example, ""zup bluf dax,"" ""zup"" comes first, which seems to start the pattern with yellow (as ""bluf"" is the next word and has been seen near ""zup"" previously), followed by repeating ""yellow"" and then moving onto ""green"" for ""dax"".

Based on these observations, we can conclude that:

zup -> ""zup"" signifies a change in the sequence pattern, leading to a different color being repeated following the count of the previously mentioned color.

Rule: When ""zup"" appears, repeat the next color the same number of times as the previous color was mentioned before ""zup"". If ""zup"" is the first word or if it follows a new color word not mentioned earlier, the next color seems to start with yellow.",-7.6503499566399995,125,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""zup"" denotes a transition from one color to another, specifically causing the repeated output of the color that comes right after its appearance in the string. To elucidate further, here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""walm"" maps to ""green"", and after ""zup"", ""green"" is repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""zup"" is followed by a ""green"" associated with ""dax"". 
- In the third example, ""zup"" is directly followed by a ""yellow"" which is associated with ""bluf"" (assuming bluf maps to yellow, as indicated by the last example where ""bluf"" precedes ""zup"" and results in ""red"" repeated).
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" is preceded by ""red"" associated with ""wif"", and after ""zup"", ""red"" is repeated twice.
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" again precipitates a change, causing the color following it (""red"" associated with ""wif"") to be repeated.

Hence, the rule seems to be that ""zup"" causes the subsequent color term to be repeated three times.

Rule: zup -> causes the next color to be repeated three times.",-8.45680219386,125,zup
"Based on the input-output pairs provided, we can deduce that each word is associated with a specific color:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" seems to take on the color that was just previously mentioned

To confirm this, let's look at each example:

1. ""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green""

2. ""zup bluf dax"" -> ""yellow yellow green""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow""

3. ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow green yellow green red red""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red""

4. ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green yellow red green green""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green""

5. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" is not provided in the input-output pairs, but it follows ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green,"" so it might also correspond to ""green"" based on the pattern.

Given these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the word immediately before it. If ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" its color is ""red""; if it follows ""dax,"" its color is ""green""; if it follows ""zup,"" its color is ""yellow"".",-1.1330666512500003,125,bluf

1. Each input is a series of words, and each word corresponds to a color in the output.
2. The colors corresponding to ""dax"" and ""wif"" are consistent, with ""dax"" always mapping to green and ""wif"" always mapping to red.
3. The word ""zup"" appears to correspond to yellow, as seen in inputs 2 and 3 where its presence consistently results in yellow in the output.
4. ""Bluf"" appears alongside other words, and the output color corresponding to it seems to change based on its context.
5. In every case where ""bluf"" appears, the color immediately following it is green.

- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green.""

2. ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" translates to ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow"". Before ""walm"", there are four unique color words: red, yellow, blue, green. After ""walm"", ""yellow"" repeats four times in total (once before and three times after ""walm"").

3. ""lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". In this case, there are two unique colors: blue and yellow. After ""walm"", ""yellow"" repeats three times (once before and twice after ""walm"").

4. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" translates to ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow"". There are four unique colors before ""walm"" and thus ""yellow"" repeats four times in total.

5. ""dax lug wif walm"" translates to ""green blue red red red"". Before ""walm"", there are three unique colors, so ""red"" is repeated three times after ""walm"".

"Based on the examples given, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a pattern in the output that involves repeating the color of the word that immediately precedes ""walm."" The rule also seems to consider the quantity of the repetition based on how many occurrences of the word ""zup"" precede ""walm."" To be more specific:
- If no ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the preceding color is repeated once.
- If ""zup"" is present before ""walm,"" the repetition count of the preceding color equals the number of times ""zup"" appears before ""walm.""

Here is the detailed breakdown per example:
- dax walm -> green green green (no ""zup,"" thus ""green"" is repeated once)
- wif zup lug dax zup walm -> red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow (two ""zups,"" thus ""green"" is repeated twice)
- lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue (one ""zup,"" thus ""yellow"" is repeated once)
- lug wif dax zup walm -> blue red green yellow yellow yellow (one ""zup,"" thus ""yellow"" is repeated once)
- dax lug wif walm -> green blue red red red (no ""zup,"" thus ""red"" is repeated once)

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:
walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word, with the repetition count determined by the quantity of preceding ""zup"" instances. If no ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" repeat once.

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes a repetition of the last color mentioned before it, repeated as many times as there are total words in the sentence after ""walm"". 

To illustrate:

- In the first example, ""dax walm"" is followed by ""green green green"", indicating that the word before ""walm"" (which is ""dax"" corresponding to ""green"") is repeated three times because there are three words in total in the input (""dax walm"").

- In the second example, ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" is followed by ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow"". Here, ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"" and there are six words in total, hence ""yellow"" is repeated three times after it since ""walm"" is the sixth word.

"Observing the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the pattern that defines the meaning of the nonce word ""walm.""

Looking at the outputs corresponding to each input, we see that every time ""walm"" is used in a sequence, it results in a repetition of the last color word that precedes it (its immediate left context):

- Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green
  (The color green, which is from ""dax"", is repeated three times.)

- Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm -> Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
  (The color yellow, which is from ""zup"", is repeated three times following ""walm"".)

- Input: lug zup walm lug -> Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
  (Again, the color yellow from ""zup"" is repeated three times following ""walm"".)

- Input: lug wif dax zup walm -> Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
  (The color yellow from ""zup"" is repeated three times following ""walm"".)

- Input: dax lug wif walm -> Output: green blue red red red
  (The color red from ""wif"" is repeated three times following ""walm"".)

Based on these observations, we can infer the following rule:

"Rule: zup corresponds to the color that should be utilized for the word that directly follows it. If there is no word following zup, then zup defaults to the color yellow.

Explanation of Rule Application:

Example 1: ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" translates to ""green green red yellow green"". Here, zup precedes dax, which is green, and thus zup takes on the color yellow, which acts as a placeholder to indicate the color of the word following it.

Example 2: ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue"". zup does not follow any word in the sequence, thus it is yellow. Wif is red, walm is red, and lug is blue as their default colors.

Example 3: ""dax zup"" translates to ""green yellow"". Here, zup follows dax and thus takes the color yellow since there is no word following zup.

Example 4: ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"". Here, zup is followed by bluf, which has the default color yellow, and as per the rule stated, zup adopts the upcoming color.

Example 5: ""wif dax zup"" translates to ""red green yellow"". In this sequence, zup is following the word dax, so it takes the color yellow given there is no word after zup.

Given the examples provided and the deduction from their patterns, zup's color is dependent on the context—it stands for yellow when there's no word after it, but when there is, it signifies that the following word's color should be considered the output for zup. 

Thus, the rule is: zup -> yellow or the color of the next word if there is one.",-0.9270807153699998,127,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it becomes apparent that the word ""zup"" corresponds to a specific color each time it is used. The sequence in which ""zup"" appears along with other words, which represent specific colors, informs us of the color that ""zup"" represents.

From the examples:

1. In the first example, ""dax"" clearly maps to ""green,"" as we see from the first and last items. ""wif"" maps to ""red"" because it is consistent across different inputs. Since there's only one instance of the word ""zup"" here, we cannot determine its meaning from this example alone.

2. In the second example, ""wif"" is consistent as ""red,"" and there's a new word ""walm"" that corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" that corresponds to the new color blue. ""zup"" appears once again, and since the corresponding output color is ""yellow,"" this instance suggests ""zup"" could correspond to ""yellow.""

3. In the third example, ""dax"" is again ""green."" ""zup"" follows, and the output color is ""yellow."" This reinforces the notion that ""zup"" means ""yellow.""

4. In the fourth example, there's ""zup"" and ""bluf,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow."" We don't have a prior mapping for ""bluf,"" but since ""zup"" is first and maps to ""yellow"" in previous examples, it stands to reason that ""bluf"" also maps to ""yellow.""

5. In the fifth example, ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" again corresponds to the ""yellow"" that follows them.

From these observations, we can conclude that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in every instance it appears, regardless of the surrounding words.

Rule: zup -> yellow",-3.6398266207840004,127,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" directly corresponds to a specific color in the output sequence. Each unique input word maps to a unique color in the output. Analyzing the examples:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output. This suggests that ""dax"" maps to ""green"".
- Whenever ""wif"" appears, ""red"" appears in the output. So ""wif"" maps to ""red"".
- ""zup"" always maps to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position or the words around it.
- ""bluf"" consistently maps to ""yellow"" in the output as well.
- ""walm"" and ""lug"" are not directly mapped in the above explanation but consistently appear as ""red"" and ""blue"" respectively in the output.

Therefore, one can deduce that ""zup"" means ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow",-4.16225050131,127,zup
"Based on the example outputs correlating with each input, we can identify a pattern that associates each word with a color:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow
- walm -> red
- lug -> blue

The pattern for the word ""zup"" seems consistent across all examples—it is always associated with the color yellow. Therefore, we can deduce the following:

zup -> yellow",-6.180220886340001,127,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's see how it is used across different examples and what output it consistently corresponds with.

- In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds with the color ""yellow"".
- In the second example, ""zup"" is also corresponding with ""yellow"" as the first word.
- In the third example, ""zup"" again corresponds with the color ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, regardless of its position, ""zup"" continues to correspond with ""yellow"".
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" is in the last position and the color ""yellow"" is in the last position as well.

Every position in which ""zup"" appears, regardless of what other words are present, corresponds to the color ""yellow"".

"bluf -> ""red"" after a color word duplicates that color word

Rule: bluf -> red immediately following the color green,-11.008669421179999,127,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can observe that ""walm"" consistently translates to a sequence of three identical colors. By looking at what follows ""walm"" in each input, we can determine the rule for the color that is output:

1. In the first example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue."" The word after ""walm"" is not given, but ""lug"" before ""walm"" translates to ""blue,"" so it's possible that ""walm"" means to repeat the color of the word immediately before it three times.
   
2. In the second example, ""dax walm zup lug"" results in ""green green green yellow blue."" In this case, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which translates to ""green,"" and ""walm"" results in ""green green green,"" following the pattern from the first example.

3. In the third example, ""zup wif lug zup walm"" results in ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow."" ""Walm"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" and the output for ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" again supporting the previous pattern.

4. The fourth example, ""zup walm lug zup wif dax,"" gets the output of ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green."" Here ""walm"" again follows ""zup"" and translates to ""yellow yellow yellow.""

5. The fifth example, ""zup dax walm lug wif,"" has the output ""yellow green green green blue red."" ""Walm"" comes after ""dax"" and results in ""green green green.""

From these observations, we can conclude that the word ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the word immediately before it, three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word three times.",-0.823190720026,127,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can start by observing the positions where it appears and its corresponding output color:

1. lug walm -> blue blue blue

3. zup wif lug zup walm -> yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
4. zup walm lug zup wif dax -> yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
5. zup dax walm lug wif -> yellow green green green blue red

We can analyze the patterns and deduce a possible rule for ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the output is three repetitions of ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and appears before ""zup lug,"" resulting in three repetitions of ""green"" followed by ""yellow blue.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" is the last word and the output ends in three repetitions of ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output for ""walm"" is three repetitions of ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""lug,"" producing three repetitions of ""green.""

From these points, we can deduce a consistent pattern. Every time ""walm"" appears, it is translated into three repetitions of the color associated with the word that comes directly before it:

- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue"" repeated three times.
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green"" repeated three times.
- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow"" repeated three times.

- When ""walm"" stands alone or is followed by ""lug"" or ""dax,"" the output corresponding to ""walm"" matches the color associated with the word just before it (e.g., zup dax walm lug -> yellow green green green blue).

- dax (green, green, green)

Since ""lug,"" ""zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""dax"" correspond consistently to ""blue,"" ""yellow,"" ""red,"" and ""green"" respectively, we can now try to deduce the rule for ""walm"" based on the color outputs when ""walm"" is present.

1. lug walm -> blue blue
2. dax walm zup lug -> green green yellow blue
3. zup wif lug zup walm -> yellow red blue yellow yellow
4. zup walm lug zup wif dax -> yellow yellow blue yellow red green
5. zup dax walm lug wif -> yellow green green blue red

Looking at the first instance (example 1), ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the output is simply ""blue blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" could mean ""blue"" since ""lug"" also translates to ""blue."" However, as we look at the other instances, we notice something else.

If we dig deeper, in each line where ""walm"" appears, it translates to as many ""green"" as the number of words between ""walm"" and the next occurrence of ""lug"" (or the end of the input sequence if ""lug"" doesn't appear again). Based on this observation:

1. lug walm -> blue blue (0 words between ""walm"" and ""lug/end,"" thus 0 greens)
2. dax walm zup lug -> green green yellow blue (1 word between ""walm"" and ""lug,"" thus 1 green)
3. zup wif lug zup walm -> yellow red blue yellow yellow (2 words between ""walm"" and the end, thus 2 greens)
4. zup walm lug zup wif dax -> yellow yellow blue yellow red green (0 words between ""walm"" and ""lug,"" thus 0 greens)
5. zup dax walm lug wif -> yellow green green blue red (1 word between ""walm"" and ""lug,"" thus 1 green)

Therefore, it seems that the rule for ""walm"" is to repeat the color ""green"" as many times as there are words between ""walm"" and the following ""lug"" (or the end of the sequence if ""lug"" is absent).

walm -> meaning: Repeat ""green"" for each word occurring between the position of ""walm"" and the next ""lug"" or the end of the list if ""lug"" is not present.

Rule: If walm precedes lug (or the end if there's no subsequent lug), count the words in between, and output that number of ""green"" colors.",-5.241632139039999,127,walm
"Analyzing the examples given, and the correlation between the input containing the nonce word 'walm' and the output, we deduce the following:

- Whenever 'walm' is present in the input, the output contains a series of the same color repeated.
- The number of repetitions of the color in the output corresponds to the position of 'walm' in the input sequence.
- The color that is repeated corresponds to the color that would represent 'lug' in the output, which is 'blue'.

From these observations, we induce the following rule:

Rule: 'walm' in the input results in the output of the color 'blue' repeated as many times as the position of 'walm' in the input sequence.

Therefore, walm -> 'blue' repeated based on its position in the sequence.
",-12.273913622499999,127,walm
"lug -> change each preceding word to its corresponding color and repeat it the number of times given by the position it appears in the sequence. Rule:
- The first word before ""lug"" is changed to its corresponding color and mentioned once.
- The second word before ""lug"" is changed to its corresponding color and mentioned twice, and so on.

For instance, in the input ""wif lug"", ""wif"" is the first and only word before ""lug"", so it is changed to ""red"" and mentioned once, followed by ""blue"" since ""lug"" adds the color blue at every occurrence.

In the input ""zup wif lug wif"", ""zup wif"" is before ""lug"", ""zup"" is the first word which corresponds to ""yellow"" and is mentioned once, ""wif"" is the second word which corresponds to ""red"" and is mentioned twice, followed by ""blue"" for ""lug"", and then ""wif"" is after ""lug"", which just adds ""red"" without affecting other patterns.",-4.89344747482,128,lug
"Based on the given examples, we can attempt to induce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" through their commonality and patterns in the input-output pairs.

1. Input: wif lug | Output: red blue
2. Input: zup lug | Output: yellow blue
3. Input: zup wif lug wif | Output: yellow red blue red
4. Input: lug zup | Output: blue yellow
5. Input: lug walm zup walm | Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow

In examples 1 and 2, ""lug"" follows another nonce word (wif, zup) and contributes 'blue' consistently to the output. In example 3, ""lug"" appears after both 'zup' and 'wif', and again 'blue' is present after the colors corresponding to 'zup' and 'wif'. In example 4, despite 'lug' coming before 'zup', 'blue' still precedes 'yellow' in the output. Lastly, in example 5, 'lug' precedes both 'walm' and 'zup', and 'blue' appears three times before the sequence of 'yellow' which corresponds to the two instances of 'walm' and one instance of 'zup'.

From these patterns, we can induce that ""lug"" translates to 'blue', and its placement in the input doesn't affect the sequence of colors in the output, as 'blue' directly follows it. The other nonce words must have associated color meanings that determine the sequence, and ""lug"" contributes its own color to this sequence without altering the order dictated by the other words.

Input: dax
Output: green

From these observations, it is consistently shown that ""dax"" correlates to the output ""green."" The other words seem to correlate to other colors, but ""dax"" is the only word to consistently result in ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green",-6.208891116151,128,dax
"Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Meanwhile, the other words in the inputs seem to correspond to other colors. 
For simplicity, let's break down one of the examples:

Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green

The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" The word ""walm"" is followed by two ""green"" which likely means it triggers the output of two additional ""green"" next to the color it represents.

Another example:

"Observing the examples given, we can try to identify a pattern for the word 'wif' based on its position and the words around it, as well as the output colors. Here's the breakdown:

In the first example:
- ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue red green green red"".
  The ""wif"" occurs between two different colors and translates to ""red"". After ""bluf"", ""wif"" again translates to ""red"".
  
In the second example:
- ""wif lug dax"" translates to ""red blue green"".
  Here, ""wif"" comes first and translates to ""red"".
  
In the third example:
- ""zup walm wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow red"".
  ""wif"" is at the end and translates to ""red"" after ""walm"" which repeats the color of the word before it (yellow).
  
In the fourth example:
- ""wif dax zup bluf"" translates to ""red green yellow yellow"".
  ""wif"" starts the sequence and translates to ""red"".
  
In the fifth example:
- ""dax lug wif walm"" translates to ""green blue red red red"".
  ""wif"" follows two different colors and precedes a color repetition (""walm""), translating to ""red"".

Based on these observations, ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"", regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words. The output for ""wif"" does not seem to be influenced by the position or the surroundings, as it consistently results in the color ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red",-1.10903531956,128,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's examine each example and look for patterns:

1. ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" corresponds to ""yellow blue red green green red""

In this case, ""wif"" precedes the colors ""red"" and ""green."" After the word ""wif,"" the color sequence ""green red"" is reversed from the sequence ""red green"" that appears before it. However, the word ""wif"" first appears after ""lug,"" translating to ""blue,"" and is followed by ""red."" This could mean that ""wif"" signals a change, but the rule is not clear yet.

2. ""wif lug dax"" corresponds to ""red blue green""

Here, ""wif"" precedes ""red,"" and the other colors follow in a sequence.

3. ""zup walm wif"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow red""

It seems ""wif"" is again associated with the color ""red,"" and the color before ""wif"" repeats until ""wif"" occurs.

4. ""wif dax zup bluf"" corresponds to ""red green yellow yellow""

Once more, ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and the color sequence appears to be reversed from the sentence structure if ""zup"" represents ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" represents ""yellow.""

5. ""dax lug wif walm"" corresponds to ""green blue red red red""

For this example, it looks like ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red,"" and following ""wif"" is a repetition of ""red.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be that it signals a transition to the color ""red,"" with the possibility of influencing what comes after it in varied ways (in some cases causing repetition or a reversal). However, from the given examples, the exact rule of how ""wif"" affects subsequent words is not entirely clear. The only consistent rule is that ""wif"" translates directly to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",-1.2594104959980001,128,wif
"Based on the examples given:

- The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue""
- The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green""
- The word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow""
- The word ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""yellow""

When ""wif"" is present in the input, it seems to delineate a pattern change in the color sequence. Whenever ""wif"" is mentioned before a word, the output color for that word is ""red"". However, when ""wif"" is after an already mentioned color, it repeats the previous color instead of changing it to another color. This can be seen more clearly in inputs that contain multiple instances of ""wif"".

Rule: wif -> When preceding a word, it translates to ""red"". When following a word (or another ""wif""), it repeats the color that was translated right before it.

Examples supporting the rule:

- Input: ""wif lug"" -> Output: ""red blue"" (wif changes the following color to red)
- Input: ""lug wif"" -> Output: ""blue blue"" (wif repeats the previous color)
- Input: ""wif dax"" -> Output: ""red green"" (wif changes the following color to red)
- Input: ""dax wif"" -> Output: ""green green"" (wif repeats the previous color)
- Input: ""wif walm"" -> Output: ""red red red"" (wif first changes the following color to red, and then continues to repeat the color red)

wif -> red when preceding another color, repeats the previous color when following a word.",-2.51426715582,128,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that each word translates to a specific color:

- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""bluf"" -> yellow
- ""walm"" -> red (note: ""walm"" appears several times before ""wif"" and each time it translates to red, but in the last example, ""wif walm"" translates to a repetition of red, suggesting a possible pattern)

Now considering the occurrences of ""wif"":
- When ""wif"" appears before another color word, the output color sequence remains uninterrupted. This would imply ""wif"" does not introduce a new color but might modify the subsequent color word.
- However, when ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"", the color red is repeated, suggesting that ""wif"" may have an effect on repetition.

Therefore, from the above observations, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: ""wif"" indicates a repetition of the subsequent color word in the output or perhaps a placeholder for the previously mentioned color when it appears at the end of the sequence.

However, the available examples do not provide an instance where ""wif"" is followed by any word other than ""walm"" or is at the end of the sequence, so we cannot definitively conclude its behavior in other contexts.

Given this, a tentative rule for ""wif"" could be:

Rule: wif -> indicates the repetition of the next color, or if at the end, the previous color.",-7.56449587152,128,wif

"To deduce the meaning of ""zup"", we should look for patterns in its use across different examples. Here is the analysis:

- In all instances, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.
- It does not appear that the meaning of ""zup"" depends on the words preceding or following it.
- Regardless of position in the input sequence, ""zup"" always results in ""yellow.""

"To determine the meaning or the rule behind ""bluf,"" let's analyze the color patterns that emerge each time ""bluf"" is used.

   Output: yellow green green

3. Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
   Output: yellow red red yellow blue

4. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red

5. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

Now, let's look for a consistent pattern in the use of ""bluf"" across the examples:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by a single color (green), even though it is preceded by both ""wif"" and ""dax,"" which correlate to red and green respectively. However, the color green is repeated twice.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" (green) and is followed by green. 
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is sandwiched between ""wif"" (red) and another ""zup,"" yet it correlates to red, not mixed or a new color.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is after ""wif"" (red) and the output is red.
- In the fifth example, there are two instances of ""bluf."" Each time it's following a different word (""dax"" and ""zup"") and both times the output for ""bluf"" is the same as the preceding color (green and yellow, respectively).

Based on this analysis, it appears that ""bluf"" indicates the repetition of the color of the word immediately before it. When ""bluf"" is present, it inherits the color from the preceding word, but does not create a color on its own.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the previous word.",-6.432568353694,128,bluf
"Based on the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, we can attempt to deduce what ""bluf"" means by examining the context in which it appears and the corresponding output color. Here are the observations:

1. Whenever ""bluf"" appears, the color ""red"" is produced in the output sequence.
2. The word ""bluf"" never appears at the beginning or end of an input sequence; it is always preceded and followed by another word.
3. The presence of other words in the input sequence results in different colors in the output sequence (e.g., ""wif"" leads to an output of ""red"", ""dax"" leads to ""green"", ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" leads to ""blue"").
4. The word ""bluf"" consistently results in two occurrences of ""red"" in the output sequence, regardless of the words that precede or follow it.
5. The presence of ""bluf"" does not seem to affect the output color associated with other words; their corresponding colors remain consistent whether ""bluf"" is present in the sequence or not.

From these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" results in the output of ""red red"" (two occurrences of the color red, irrespective of its position in the sequence relative to other words).

Therefore, based on the rule induction from the examples provided:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: Whenever ""bluf"" is present in the input, it corresponds to two consecutive ""red"" in the output.",-6.65474300476,128,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" based on the color outputs, we need to analyze the patterns corresponding to its occurrence:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" appears between ""dax"" and ""walm."" ""Dax"" corresponds to green, and ""wif"" to red. Since the output after ""dax"" is a series of green followed by ""bluf"" and then more greens, ""bluf"" doesn't seem to change the pattern initiated by ""dax."" It's likely that ""bluf"" might maintain, extend, or have no impact on the preceding color.

- In the second and third examples, we see ""bluf"" after ""dax"" and before a color change. After ""bluf,” the pattern changes, suggesting that ""bluf"" might be an indicator for a shift or might be filling a pattern until a change occurs.

- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" continues the red trend suggested by ""wif.""

- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" appears twice: first, it continues the green pattern after ""dax,"" and second, it sustains the yellow pattern after a ""zup."" This again indicates that ""bluf"" might be maintaining the current pattern.

Considering the given examples, ""bluf"" seems to act as a placeholder that continues the current color pattern until there is an explicit change caused by another word. If ""dax"" signifies green and ""wif"" signifies red, ""bluf"" doesn't change the color but continues with the same color output as the word right before it until a different word changes the color pattern. 

Based on this analysis, the rule can be formulated as follows:

Rule: bluf continues the color output of the previous word, irrespective of what that color is, until a new word specifies a different color.",-6.686984363860001,128,bluf

Therefore: bluf -> red.",-11.211492145240001,128,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, bluf consistently corresponds to the color red. For example, in the first input, ""wif bluf dax walm,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""Output: red."" This pattern is consistent across all the given examples, as ""bluf"" always translates to ""red"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule is: bluf -> red.",-14.19901635360833,128,bluf
"The rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it two additional times. Therefore, when ""walm"" follows a word, the output color for that word is given once followed by two more of the same color for ""walm"".

Here are the mappings from the input words to colors, based on the examples:
dax -> green
lug -> blue
wif -> red
zup -> yellow (Note: ""zup"" does not seem to influence ""walm,"" as ""walm"" follows the color of the word directly before it.)

Now, applying the rule we deduced to each case:

1. ""dax walm zup"" gives us ""green green"" (for ""dax walm"") then ""yellow"" for ""zup"".
2. ""lug walm zup walm"" gives us ""blue blue"" (for ""lug walm"") then ""yellow"" for ""zup"" and then ""yellow yellow"" for ""walm"" after ""zup"".
3. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" gives us ""red"" for ""wif"", ""blue"" for ""lug"", ""yellow"" for ""zup"", ""yellow yellow"" for ""walm"" after ""zup"", then again ""red"" for ""wif"" and ""blue"" for ""lug"".
4. ""dax walm wif walm"" gives us ""green green"" for ""dax walm"", ""red"" for ""wif"" and ""red red"" for ""walm"" after ""wif"".
5. ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" gives us ""blue blue"" for ""lug walm"", ""green"" for ""dax"", ""red"" for ""wif"", then ""blue"" for ""lug"" followed by ""red"" for the last ""wif"".

Hence the rule for ""walm"" is: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word two additional times.

Rule: walm -> Duplicate the color of the word just before it, two more times.",-4.198825247494,128,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we'll first compare the inputs and outputs, keeping an eye on the positions where ""walm"" appears and the colors it produces in the output.

- In the first input ""dax walm zup,"" the word ""walm"" corresponds to the second and third ""green"" and the first ""yellow"" in the output.

- In the second input ""lug walm zup walm,"" the word ""walm"" corresponds to all ""yellow"" in the output since ""lug"" is consistently associated with ""blue.""

- In the third input ""wif lug zup walm wif lug,"" ""walm"" produces three ""yellow"" following a pattern established by preceding words. It is followed by previously used words, which keep their color associations.

- In the fourth input ""dax walm wif walm,"" ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" whenever it follows ""dax,"" and to ""red"" when followed by ""wif,"" with ""walm"" consistently producing ""red"" in this setting.

- In the fifth input ""lug walm dax wif lug wif,"" we again see ""walm"" producing ""blue"" following ""lug"" and ""green"" following ""dax."" It is important to note that other words keep their associated colors, which suggests that ""walm"" is sensitive to its position and the preceding word.

Based on these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" modifies the color sequence based on the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. ""Walm"" doubles the color associated with the preceding word and then produces an additional ""yellow."" For example, if ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" then ""walm"" would output ""blue blue yellow."" When ""walm"" follows itself, it continues producing ""yellow.""

Rule:
walm -> Doubles the color of the preceding word and adds one ""yellow."" If preceded by itself, it continues producing ""yellow.""",-8.192682685314,128,walm
"Analyzing the input-output pairs, we can infer:

- The word ""walm"" repeatedly generates a set of three colors in the output.
- The color that is produced is based on the word that immediately follows ""walm.""
- For ""dax walm,"" the output is ""green green green,"" thus the color associated with ""dax"" appears to be green.
- For ""lug walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue,"" thus the color associated with ""lug"" appears to be blue.
- For ""zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" thus the color associated with ""zup"" appears to be yellow.
- For ""wif walm,"" the output is ""red red red,"" thus the color associated with ""wif"" appears to be red.

- When ""lug walm"" occurs, the output is ""blue blue blue"", reinforcing the idea that ""walm"" may prompt a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.
- The repetition occurs three times for both ""dax"" and ""lug"", which could indicate that the number of repetitions is not dependent on the specific word but rather a rule of ""walm"" itself.

Given these observations, we can propose a rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" occurs after a word, the output repeats the corresponding color of that word three times.

Hence,

walm -> causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated three times.",-10.250328020972,128,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it, three times. If ""walm"" is the first word in the sequence, it corresponds to the color green.",-10.95276306544,128,walm

"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output.",-8.621554852908002,129,lug
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore:

Rule: lug -> blue",-8.7417347959,129,lug
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.",-9.16262234696,129,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look for patterns in the examples provided.

In each instance where ""dax"" appears, we can look at the subsequent word to try to identify a pattern in the output.

1. wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
2. wif dax wif lug wif -> red green red blue red
3. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
4. zup dax walm lug wif -> yellow green green green blue red
5. dax walm -> green green green

Analyzing these pairs:

- From example 1), after ""dax"" comes ""zup,"" and the corresponding output color is green. Next color after green is yellow.
- From example 2), after ""dax"" comes ""wif,"" and the corresponding output color is green. Next color after green is red.
- From example 3), after ""dax"" comes ""lug,"" and the corresponding output color is green. Next color after green is blue.
- From example 4), after ""dax"" comes ""walm,"" and the corresponding output color is green. Next color after green is green.
- From example 5), after ""dax"" comes ""walm,"" and the corresponding output color is green. It is followed by more greens.

From these observations, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to an output color ""green,"" and subsequently, it indicates the repetition of the next color output. 

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
- ""dax"" causes the next color to repeat.

Using this induction, we can now define ""dax"":
Rule: dax -> causes the next color in the sequence to repeat.",-1.292069847074,129,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" signals a switch in the color pattern. Before ""dax"" is mentioned, one color is used, and after ""dax"" is mentioned, a different color pattern follows. It is not immediately apparent what the color pattern is because we do not have a direct mapping of words to colors for all words. However, we can see that ""wif"" correlates to red before ""dax"" and blue after ""dax"". ""Walm"" correlates to blue after ""dax"" but does not appear before ""dax"" in any example. ""Lug"" correlates to blue both before and after ""dax"" when it is followed by ""walm"", but changes to yellow when followed by ""wif"" after ""dax"".

Looking at the examples, let's try to identify a consistent rule:

1. ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" results in ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue"", showing that before ""dax"", ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" is also red. After ""dax"", ""zup"" changes color to green, ""wif"" to yellow, ""lug"" to red, and ""walm"" to blue.
   
2. ""wif dax wif lug wif"" shows that ""wif"" before ""dax"" is red and changes to green after ""dax"". However, the next ""wif"" after ""lug"" is blue instead of red or green.

3. ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue"", which implies that ""lug walm"" after ""dax"" are both blue.

4. ""zup dax walm lug wif"" results in ""yellow green green green blue red"", implying ""zup"" is yellow before ""dax"", then ""walm"" and ""lug"" are green after ""dax"", with the next ""wif"" being blue.

5. ""dax walm"" simply gives us ""green green green"", which tells us ""walm"" after ""dax"" is green.

To summarize, ""dax"" appears to affect word-color mappings before and after its appearance within a sequence. However, due to inconsistencies or potentially complex rules that control the color changes, we cannot derive a straightforward translation of ""dax"" without additional information. The proposed rule, then, is that ""dax"" causes a switch in color mappings, but the exact nature of that switch appears to be complex and dependent on the surrounding context.

Rule: dax seems to trigger a change in the color pattern followed by the words before and after it, but the specific color pattern change induced by ""dax"" cannot be determined with absolute certainty without further information.",-2.5786230285799996,129,dax
"From the examples provided, it's possible to deduce a pattern that associates the nonce word ""dax"" with a specific color output. Here's the analysis:

1. The first example has ""dax"" followed by ""zup"" and yields a ""green"" output, while ""zup"" without ""dax"" produces ""yellow"" in the fourth example.
2. The second example presents ""dax"" between ""wif"" tokens and the output is ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""red"" for each ""wif"".
3. The third example shows ""dax"" followed by ""lug"" and ""walm"", yielding ""green"" followed by ""blue blue blue"".
4. The fourth example has ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" and ""lug"", producing ""green green green blue"".
5. The fifth example again just has ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" and the entire output is ""green"".

Based on this analysis, irrespective of the context or surrounding words, ""dax"" consistently leads to the output of ""green"". Therefore, we can propose the following definition:

Rule: dax -> produces the output ""green"".",-6.560537371300001,129,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine the position of the word in each input and the corresponding colors in the output:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   
2. Input: wif dax wif lug wif
   Output: red green red blue red
   
3. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   
4. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red
   
5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

From these examples, we can observe the following:

- In every output sequence that corresponds to an input with ""dax,"" the first color after ""dax"" is always green.
- This color is then often followed by a repetition, which seems to be dependent on the word after ""dax"". Specifically, when ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the green color is repeated, indicating a potential link between ""walm"" and repetitive color output.

Based on this analysis, ""dax"" could be functioning as an instruction or marker that dictates the color green should be used for the following output section, and it may also influence the repetition of colors based on the subsequent word. However, without further examples that isolate the word ""dax"" from others like ""walm,"" it's challenging to prescribe a more precise rule or meaning.

"To deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at the correlation between the presence of ""bluf"" in the inputs and the outputs provided:

1. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow green yellow green red red

2. Input: lug wif bluf

   Output: yellow green green yellow green

4. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

5. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green

In these examples, each input word correlates with a color in the output. Observing the patterns, we can infer the following:

- ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds with ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds with ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue""
- ""walm"" has no direct translation, but the presence of ""wif"" before it results in an additional ""red"" in the output.

Focusing on the word ""bluf,"" we can see that it leads to a color repetition but does not introduce a new color:

1. ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" -> Output repeats ""red""
2. ""bluf"" follows ""lug wif"" -> Output still repeats ""red""
3. ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" -> Output repeats ""green""
4. ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" -> Output repeats ""yellow""

"Analyzing the given examples where the input includes ""walm"" and looking at the corresponding output, the following pattern can be observed:

- Every time the word ""walm"" appears in the input, the output is a repetition of three colors.
- The color that is repeated three times is always the color that corresponds to the word that appears directly before ""walm"" in the input.

From the examples:

1. Input: ""dax walm"" -> Output: ""green green green""
2. Input: ""lug wif dax zup walm"" -> Output: ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow""
   (The color ""yellow"" is repeated three times, which corresponds to the word ""zup"" that comes directly before ""walm"".)
3. Input: ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" -> Output: ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow""
   (The word ""walm"" appears twice here; first, it repeats the color ""red,"" which corresponds to ""wif,"" and then it repeats ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup"".)
4. Input: ""dax walm"" -> Output: ""green green green""
5. Input: ""zup wif walm lug"" -> Output: ""yellow red red red blue""
   (The color ""red"" is repeated three times, which corresponds to the word ""wif"" that comes directly before ""walm"".)

Based on this pattern, the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be a rule where ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately before it to be repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.",-0.48371837088499997,129,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns and associations with the outputs in each example. 

Looking at the examples provided:

1. ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green""
2. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" corresponds to ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow""
3. ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" corresponds to ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow""
4. ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green""
5. ""zup wif walm lug"" corresponds to ""yellow red red red blue""

In every output where the word ""walm"" is used, the color ""red"" appears an additional two times followed by ""yellow"". It's also notable that ""walm"" does not have a single corresponding color, but its presence in the input impacts the colors that follow it. Considering this:

1. In the first and fourth examples, since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and there are three ""green"" in the output, this leads us to think that ""walm"" may indicate a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.
2. In the second example, after ""walm,"" there is a repetition of ""yellow"".
3. In the third example, ""red"" is repeated three times, followed by ""blue"" corresponding to ""lug,"" and then three ""yellow"" for the second ""walm"".
4. In the fifth example, after ""walm,"" there is a repetition of ""red"" followed by ""blue.""

The rule seems to be: ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color immediately preceding it three times; the third repetition is ""red"" followed by ""yellow"".

Hence, the rule is:

walm -> Repeat the color value associated with the prior word thrice, with the third instance being ""red"" followed by ""yellow.""

Example:

""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green red yellow"". However, in each instance provided, the final ""green"" was omitted, possibly a pattern or an error in the dataset. If not an error, we would need more information to determine why ""green"" is omitted consistently in the output when ""walm"" comes after ""dax.""",-1.9982414128919999,129,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm."" 

From the first and fourth examples, we see that ""dax walm"" generates ""green green green."" This implies that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it.

In the second example, ""lug wif dax zup walm"" outputs ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" and we see a triple ""yellow"" follow ""walm,"" indicating that ""walm"" again causes the repetition of the preceding color.

The third example, ""dax wif walm lug zup walm,"" affirms the rule we are deducing with ""wif"" being ""red"" and ""walm"" causing ""red"" to repeat three times. Similarly, ""zup"" being ""yellow"" is repeated three times following the second ""walm.""

The fifth example, ""zup wif walm lug,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" also fits the established pattern, and following ""walm,"" we see ""red"" repeated thrice, which matches with the color assigned to ""wif"" before it.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times.

"
From the provided examples, it appears that 'walm' causes the following word to have its corresponding color repeated three times. Here are the rules that seem to be at play for each input and output:

- In ""dax walm,"" 'dax' translates to 'green', and then 'walm' causes the word 'green' to be repeated three times.
  
- In ""lug wif dax zup walm,"" the words translate to single instances of their corresponding colors: 'lug' -> 'blue', 'wif' -> 'red', 'dax' -> 'green', 'zup' -> 'yellow'. When we reach 'walm', the word 'yellow' is repeated three times, as that is the color corresponding to the word immediately before 'walm'.

- In ""dax wif walm lug zup walm,"" 'dax' translates to 'green' and 'wif' to 'red'. The first 'walm' makes 'red' repeat three times. Then 'lug' translates to 'blue', and 'zup' to 'yellow', followed by 'walm', making 'yellow' repeat three times.

- In ""dax walm,"" as before, 'dax' translates to 'green', and 'walm' makes 'green' repeat three times.

- In ""zup wif walm lug,"" 'zup' translates to 'yellow', and 'wif' to 'red'. The first 'walm' makes 'red' repeat three times. 'Lug' then is translated as 'blue'.

So, the rule for 'walm' seems to be that it causes the color corresponding to the word immediately before it to be repeated three times.

- In the second example, ""dax"" is green and ""walm"" again results in a triple repetition, now following ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow, leading to ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In the third example, there are two instances of ""walm"", each following a color (first ""green"" then ""yellow"") and in both cases, ""walm"" results in the color being repeated three times.
- In the fourth example, it's the same as the first, reinforcing the rule.

- ""dax zup"" translates to ""green yellow,"" where ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow.""
- ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red,"" where other words such as ""lug"" and ""walm"" correspond to colors (""blue"" and ""blue"" respectively), and ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""dax wif zup"" translates to ""green red yellow,"" maintaining the association of ""zup"" with ""yellow.""
- ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow,"" where ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow.""
- ""zup wif zup"" translates to ""yellow red yellow,"" where ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""zup"" is again ""yellow.""

So the rule is:

"Based on the examples provided where the output is known, a pattern emerges indicating the color that corresponds to each nonce word. Examining each instance of zup and its corresponding output in the provided examples, we can determine what zup means. 

For every example provided, whenever the word zup is mentioned, the color yellow is given in the output. This correspondence does not change regardless of the words that come before or after zup in the input string.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce for the nonce word zup is as follows:

zup -> meaning: The meaning of the nonce word zup is the color yellow.

Rule: zup corresponds to the color yellow.",-9.29061152692,130,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns in the examples provided:

1. When ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" is the input, the output is ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue"". Here the non-bluf sequence ""zup lug zup lug"" would likely correspond to ""yellow blue yellow blue"", so the presence of ""bluf"" changed the 3rd term from ""blue"" to ""yellow.""

2. In the input ""zup wif bluf,"" the output is ""yellow red red."" Without ""bluf,"" a reasonable assumption for ""zup wif"" might be ""yellow red"", suggesting ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""

3. For the input ""lug bluf dax lug,"" the output is ""blue blue green blue."" If ""bluf"" was not present we might assume ""lug dax lug"" translates to ""blue green blue,"" suggesting ""bluf"" translates to ""blue.""

4. When the input is ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug,"" the resulting output is ""blue red green green red blue."" If ""bluf"" were removed, an expected pattern for ""lug wif dax wif lug"" would be ""blue red green red blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" replacing ""dax"" results in ""green.""

5. Lastly, the input ""zup bluf dax lug"" yields the output ""yellow yellow green blue."" Without ""bluf,"" one could anticipate ""zup dax lug"" to be ""yellow green blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" replaced ""dax"" with ""yellow.""

Considering the examples above, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color of the word immediately before it. Whenever ""bluf"" appears after a color word, it replicates that color word in the output.

Rule:
bluf -> Repeats the color of the preceding word in the sequence.",-0.705473622952,130,bluf
"Based on the patterns observed in the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" directly translates to a color. Specifically, ""bluf"" seems to be associated with the color that directly precedes it, meaning that ""bluf"" represents the repetition of the prior color in the sequence.

Let's look at the examples given to derive the rule:

1. In the first example, ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue"". Here, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" which is translated to ""yellow"" and before it repeats the same color ""yellow"".

2. In the second example, ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red"". Here again, ""bluf"" translates to ""red"", which is the color that precedes it.

3. In the third example, ""lug bluf dax lug"" translates to ""blue blue green blue"". ""Bluf"" here is translated to ""blue"", which is the color that comes before it.

4. In the fourth example, ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" translates to ""blue red green green red blue"", wherein ""bluf"" once more corresponds to the color immediately preceding it, which is ""green"".

5. In the fifth example, ""zup bluf dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow green blue"". The ""bluf"" in this instance repeats the ""yellow"" that precedes it.

Consequently, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it represents a repetition of the color stated right before it in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> the color that precedes ""bluf"" in the sequence.",-1.035203281994,130,bluf
"To find the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look at each instance where it occurs and see how it relates to the output:

1. zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue
2. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
3. lug bluf dax lug -> blue blue green blue
4. lug wif dax bluf wif lug -> blue red green green red blue
5. zup bluf dax lug -> yellow yellow green blue

Here are some observations:

- In the 1st and 5th examples, ""bluf"" appears after ""zup"" and translates to ""yellow,"" the same as ""zup"".
- In the 2nd example, ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"" and translates to ""red,"" the same as ""wif"".
- In the 4th example, ""bluf"" appears after ""dax"" and translates to ""green,"" the same as ""dax"".
- ""bluf"" never appears as the first word in the sequence.
- Whenever ""bluf"" appears, it takes on the color of the word preceding it.

Considering these observations, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" acts as a repeater or duplicator of the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.",-1.119647215028,130,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we must investigate the pattern present in the examples given. Here is the breakdown:

1. In the first example, we see that the sequence ""zup lug zup"" results in ""yellow blue yellow,"" and then ""bluf lug"" corresponds to ""yellow blue."" Noting the presence of ""lug"" at the end in both sequences and their corresponding outputs being ""blue,"" we can assume that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" as the color before the last ""blue"" in the output.

2. In the second example, ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red."" Since ""zup"" is ""yellow"" from prior knowledge and ""wif"" is new but results in ""red,"" we might initially consider that ""bluf"" could mean ""red.""

3. However, looking at the third example, ""lug bluf dax lug,"" which outputs ""blue blue green blue,"" we see that ""bluf"" cannot mean ""red"" because it appears between two ""blue (lug)"". That suggests ""bluf"" may output the same color as the word before it, which is ""blue.""

4. The fourth example, ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug,"" translates to ""blue red green green red blue."" Note that ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and its output is also ""green."" This again supports the idea that ""bluf"" may repeat the color of the word before it.

5. The final example, ""zup bluf dax lug,"" corresponding to ""yellow yellow green blue,"" adds further support to this hypothesis. ""Bluf"" appears after ""zup"" and has the output ""yellow,"" which is the same color as ""zup.""

Based on these observations, we can induce the rule that ""bluf"" outputs the same color as the word before it in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the previous word.",-1.5093691206239999,130,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word. 
- In the first example, ""zup lug zup bluf lug"", the word before bluf is ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" so bluf corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""zup wif bluf,"" the word before bluf is ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" so bluf corresponds to ""red.""
- In the third example, ""lug bluf dax lug,"" the word before bluf is ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" so bluf corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug,"" the word before bluf is ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" so bluf corresponds to ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup bluf dax lug,"" the word before bluf is ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" so bluf corresponds to ""yellow.""

So, bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.",-6.674975151964001,130,bluf
"To discern the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the consistencies in the inputs and outputs:

1. When ""lug walm"" is inputted, the output is ""blue blue blue."" This suggests that ""lug"" maps to a single ""blue,"" and ""walm"" may cause a repetition of the color word that precedes it three times.

2. With the input ""dax lug dax lug walm,"" the output is ""green blue green blue blue blue."" This reinforces the idea that ""walm"" repeats the preceding color word three times, as we have ""dax"" mapping to ""green,"" ""lug"" mapping to ""blue,"" and then ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times. 

3. ""zup walm"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which further supports the notion that ""walm"" repeats the color related to the word before it three times, with ""zup"" mapping to ""yellow.""

4. ""zup lug walm"" translating to ""yellow blue blue blue"" aligns with this rule, since ""zup"" gives us ""yellow,"" ""lug"" gives us ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats the last said color three times.

5. Finally, ""dax walm zup lug"" becomes ""green green green yellow blue."" ""Dax"" is ""green,"" ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" The colors are sequential, with no repetition around ""zup"" and ""lug"" afterwards, because ""walm"" has already occurred.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times. 

Hence, walm -> causes the preceding color word to be said three times.",-0.8619823283599999,130,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems like the word ""walm"" results in multiple repetitions of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" Here is the rule I was able to deduce:

- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue,"" meaning ""walm"" following ""lug"" results in ""blue"" being repeated three times.
- ""dax lug dax lug walm"" outputs ""green blue green blue blue blue,"" which shows that ""walm"" after ""lug"" again leads to ""blue"" being repeated three times.
- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" following ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" being repeated three times.
- ""zup lug walm"" outputs ""yellow blue blue blue,"" further emphasizing that ""walm"" causes the color word before it to be repeated three times, in this instance ""blue"" from ""lug.""
- ""dax walm zup lug"" outputs ""green green green yellow blue,"" showing that ""walm"" after ""dax"" leads to ""green"" being repeated three times, with ""zup"" and ""lug"" following their respective color outputs of ""yellow"" and ""blue"" without repetition because ""walm"" is not after them.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the color word that comes right before it to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> When preceding a color word, causes that color to be output three times.",-1.032613619056,130,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. The number of repetitions equals the number of syllables in the preceding word. For instance:

- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, and has one syllable, so ""lug walm"" means ""blue blue blue"", or three repetitions of blue.
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and has one syllable, so ""dax walm"" means ""green green green"", or three repetitions of green.
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and has one syllable, so ""zup walm"" means ""yellow yellow yellow"", or three repetitions of yellow.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color associated with the preceding word, with the number of repetitions equal to the number of syllables in that preceding word.

- When ""wif walm"" is the input, the output is ""red red red"". ""Walm"" by itself doesn't appear in any of the examples, but its presence alongside ""wif"" results in repeated ""red"", suggesting that ""wif"" might mean ""red"" and ""walm"" may influence the repetition of the color.
- When ""wif"" appears alone, the output is ""red"", reinforcing that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- When ""wif"" is combined with ""dax"", another word whose meaning is constant (""dax"" -> ""green""), it results in ""red green"" when in sequence and the same sequence is observed when their positions are switched, again supporting that ""wif"" means ""red"".

"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's consider the sequence of the inputs and outputs.

1. In the first example, ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue green green."" Here the appearance of ""bluf"" coincides with the color green.
2. In the second example, ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" Notice that there is no green despite ""bluf"" being in the input, which challenges the initial hypothesis that ""bluf"" might mean green.
3. In the third example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow."" The term ""bluf"" does not introduce a new color.
4. In the fourth example, ""lug wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue blue."" Again, ""bluf"" doesn't add a new color but instead repeats blue.
5. In the fifth example, ""lug bluf zup"" translates to ""blue blue yellow."" ""Bluf"" corresponds to blue here as well.

Considering ""bluf"" causes a repetition of the most recent color mentioned before it:

Rule: ""bluf"" causes the previous color mentioned to be repeated. If ""bluf"" is the first word, then it does not result in an output.",-1.11362853836,131,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the pattern of input and output examples provided:

1. ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue green green"".
2. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"".
3. ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"".
4. ""lug wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue blue"".
5. ""lug bluf zup"" translates to ""blue blue yellow"".

Based on the examples, we can identify that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" Similarly, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" 

Now let's specifically look at the outputs where ""bluf"" appears:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the output color that follows ""green"" is ""green"" again.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"" and the corresponding output color is ""red,"" which is the same as what ""wif"" translates to.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" appears after ""zup,"" and the corresponding output color is ""yellow,"" matching ""zup.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" appears after ""lug,"" and the resulting color is ""blue,"" which matches ""lug.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" appears after ""lug"" again, and once more the corresponding color is ""blue.""

From these observations, we can induce that ""bluf"" means to repeat the color that was just mentioned before it.

"Rule: bluf -> blue

In each example, whenever the word bluf is present, the word blue appears the same number of times in the output. Thus, we can conclude that bluf translates to the color blue.

- In the first input, ""bluf"" occurs once and ""blue"" also occurs once in the output.
- In the second input, ""bluf"" does not occur, hence no additional instances of ""blue"" are in the output.
- In the third input, ""bluf"" occurs once and the output has ""blue"" once.
- In the fourth and fifth inputs, ""bluf"" occurs once and accordingly, ""blue"" occurs once in the output.",-10.861667280159997,131,bluf
"Observing the provided examples, the output colors seem to correspond to the input words as follows:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
  
Further examination of the outputs indicates that the number of colored outputs for each input word is equal to the number of letters in the input word:

- dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue (dax has 3 letters -> 1 green; lug has 3 letters -> 3 blues)
- wif walm -> red red red (wif has 3 letters -> 3 reds)
- wif walm dax -> red red red green (wif has 3 letters -> 3 reds; dax has 3 letters -> 1 green)
- lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue (lug has 3 letters -> 3 blues; bluf has 4 letters, but it does not seem to affect the output; dax has 3 letters -> 1 green; zup has 3 letters -> 3 yellows; the repeated lug -> 1 blue)
- wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> red red red green yellow red blue blue blue (repeating patterns from previous examples, where wif yields 3 reds, dax yields 1 green, zup yields 3 yellows, and lug yields blue outputs)

It looks like ""walm"" as an input word simply restates the colors corresponding to the word that directly precedes it. Using the examples, when ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" you get three reds, and when it follows ""lug,"" you get as many blues as the prior ""lug"" word denotes. 

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be: Repeat the color denoted by the word immediately preceding ""walm,"" with the quantity being equal to the number of letters in the preceding word.

"By examining the examples provided, we can attempt to identify a pattern for what the nonce word ""walm"" might mean in the context of this problem. 

Let's break it down:

1. ""dax lug walm"" corresponds to ""green blue blue blue"" which suggests ""walm"" might represent ""blue"".
2. ""wif walm"" matches with ""red red red"", indicating ""walm"" might mean ""red"".
3. ""wif walm dax"" matches with ""red red red green"". If ""wif"" already corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green"", then ""walm"" must be repeating the color of the word before it.
4. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". Here, ""zup walm lug"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow blue"". Since we know ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""walm"" must be the color before it, which is ""yellow"".
5. ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" is ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue"". In this case, ""walm"" follows ""wif lug"" and results in ""blue blue"". This further supports the notion that ""walm"" is a repeat of the color indicated by the word before it.

Based on all these observations, we can establish the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word preceding it. If the preceding word is ""wif"", it repeats ""red"". If the preceding word is ""lug"", it repeats ""blue"", and so on. 

Thus:

walm -> meaning. ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it.",-1.4803052575479998,131,walm

1. Input: dax lug walm

   Here, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to the color blue, so ""walm"" leads to ""blue"" being repeated.

2. Input: wif walm

   In this case, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to the color red, causing ""walm"" to produce two additional repetitions of ""red.""

   ""Zup"" is followed by ""walm"" here, and since ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated twice. The last ""lug"" corresponds to blue.

5. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

"Given the examples provided, we can induce that the word ""walm"" is associated with a repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it. Let's break down the examples one by one to understand how ""walm"" functions in this context:

1. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Here, ""lug"" (blue) is immediately before ""walm,"" and consequently, ""walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated three times.

2. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   In this case, ""wif"" (red) precedes ""walm,"" which leads to ""red"" being repeated three times.

3. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   As in the previous example, ""wif"" (red) before ""walm"" produces three ""red"" occurrences, followed by ""dax"" (green).

4. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   ""Zup"" precedes ""walm"" here, and ""zup"" (yellow) is repeated three times, followed by ""lug"" (blue).

5. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" we should look for patterns in the input and output sequences. Here's a simplified analysis based on the given examples:

1. When ""dax zup"" is the input, the output is ""green yellow."" ""Dax"" is not present in any other example, so we cannot directly deduce what ""zup"" means from this example alone. However, we can tentatively associate ""zup"" with the output ""yellow,"" assuming ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

2. When ""zup"" is followed by ""walm wif,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow red."" In the next example, ""zup wif"" alone generates ""yellow red."" This suggests that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red,"" and each occurrence of ""walm"" adds an additional ""yellow"" before ""red.""

3. The input ""zup lug walm wif walm"" results in ""yellow blue blue blue red red red."" This indicates that ""lug"" might correspond to ""blue,"" and it seems that each ""walm"" not only adds a ""yellow"" before ""red"" but also adds an extra ""blue"" after ""lug"" and an extra ""red"" after ""wif.""

4. The last example provided is identical to the second one and yields the same output, reinforcing the previously identified patterns.

Based on these observations, we can infer the following provisional rules:

- ""zup"" on its own corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""walm"" before ""wif"" results in an extra ""yellow"" for each ""walm"" and an extra ""red"" after ""wif.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and seems to increase the count of the subsequent color words in the sequence.

Rule:
zup -> yellow",-2.7123666293879998,132,zup
"To uncover the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze each input's corresponding output and search for patterns.

1. Input: dax zup
   Output: green yellow

2. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red

3. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red

4. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red

5. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red

Observations:
- Every input that starts with ""zup"" results in outputs beginning with ""yellow.""
- The rest of the outputs seem to follow a pattern depending on the nonce words that follow ""zup."" 
  - ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
  - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- When a nonce word repeats, its corresponding color repeats the same number of times.

Given these observations, the meaning of ""zup"" seems to be a rule rather than a direct color translation. It acts as a starting point or a primer for a sequence, and the sequence that follows dictates the colors' occurrence.

Rule: zup -> Initiates a sequence where the following nonce words determine the colors in the output with ""zup"" specifically leading to ""yellow.""",-7.100758458957,132,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" seems to correlate with the output of the color ""yellow."" Specifically, ""zup"" appears at the start of each input and is consistently translated to ""yellow"" in the corresponding output. However, the other words in the input (""dax,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" ""lug"") also correlate with specific colors in the outputs.

Here's the apparent mapping from the examples:

- ""dax"" -> green
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""walm"" -> yellow
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""lug"" -> blue

Notice that the output color for ""walm"" changed to blue when ""lug"" was introduced before it, suggesting that the color for ""walm"" may be context-sensitive.

But since we are focusing on ""zup,"" let's formulate the rule for it:

Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" regardless of its position or context within the input string.",-7.36320322384,132,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can infer that the nonce word ""zup"" correlates to the word ""yellow.""

This is supported by the consistent presence of the word ""yellow"" as the first output color whenever ""zup"" is the first input word. None of the other input words seem to produce a ""yellow"" in the output unless ""zup"" is present.

Rule: zup -> yellow",-8.723129253900002,132,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following patterns:

- Each occurrence of ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- The words preceding and following ""bluf"" (if any) are converted into a color based on another rule, not necessarily directly related to the meaning of ""bluf.""

It seems the word preceding ""bluf"" determines the color we repeat. When ""bluf"" appears, we repeat the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. For example, ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" translates to ""red blue blue red yellow,"" showing that the word before ""bluf"" (""lug"") corresponds to ""blue,"" and hence we get two instances of ""blue."" Similarly, in ""dax bluf zup,"" the word before ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and we see that ""bluf"" translates to a repeated ""green.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

bluf -> the color that corresponds to the preceding word, repeated once.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it.",-4.78515338582,132,bluf

Input: dax lug bluf dax
Output: green blue blue green
Here again, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (blue), and thus it is blue.

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue
Here, ""bluf"" directly follows ""lug,"" which is blue, indicating that ""bluf"" inherits this color.

Input: dax bluf zup
Output: green green yellow

"Examining the input and output pairs suggests that the output is a sequence of colors where each color seems to correspond to a specific word in the input. Additionally, it seems that the word ""walm"" is associated with a repetition of the color linked to the previous word in the input.

Let's break down the examples:

1. Input: ""wif walm zup walm""
   Output: ""red red red yellow yellow yellow""
   Here, ""wif"" is associated with red, and ""zup"" with yellow. ""Walm"" after ""wif"" leads to two more repetitions of red. ""Walm"" after ""zup"" leads to two more repetitions of yellow.

2. Input: ""zup wif walm""
   Output: ""yellow red red red""
   Here again, ""zup"" is associated with yellow, ""wif"" with red, and following ""wif"" with ""walm"" leads to two additional repetitions of red.

3. Input: ""zup walm lug zup wif dax""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green""
   ""Zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" repeating yellow twice more. ""Lug"" is associated with blue. Then ""zup"" gives us another yellow, ""wif"" red, and ""dax"" green.

4. Input: ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf""
   Output: ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""
   We see the pattern continue with ""lug"" yielding blue, ""zup"" yellow, and ""walm"" repeating it two more times. ""Dax"" gives green, ""wif"" red, and ""bluf"" (a new word) yields another red.

5. Input: ""dax walm lug""
   Output: ""green green green blue""
   Here, ""dax"" is associated with green, followed by ""walm,"" which gives us two more greens. ""Lug"" gives blue.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to repeat twice more in the output sequence.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Causes the repetition of the color linked to the preceding word two additional times.",-0.7646093540440001,132,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to dictate the number of times the color corresponding to the next word in the sequence will be repeated in the output.

- In the first example, ""wif walm zup,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" ""Walm"" causes each color to be repeated three times for a total of six outputs: red red red yellow yellow yellow.

- In the second example, ""zup wif walm,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red."" This time ""walm"" makes ""red"" appear three times after ""yellow"": yellow red red red.

- In the third example, ""zup walm lug zup wif dax,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""dax"" translates to ""green."" Here ""walm"" causes ""lug"" to be repeated three times: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green.

- In the fourth example, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red."" ""Walm"" makes ""dax"" appear three times: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red. Notice ""bluf"" doesn't have an output color, so it might be irrelevant noise, or it's inconsistent with the examples provided.

- In the last example, ""dax walm lug,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" ""Walm"" results in ""lug"" being outputted three times: green green green blue.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be: ""Repeat the indicated color three times in the output, immediately after 'walm'.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the next word three times in the output sequence.",-0.786501485486,132,walm
"Analyzing the given examples, the word ""walm"" appears to have an effect on the color sequence that follows it. 

In the Input/Output pairs:
- ""wif walm zup walm"" gives ""red red red yellow yellow yellow."" After ""wif,"" there's a switch to red and after the first ""walm,"" there's a switch to yellow which continues even after the second ""walm.""

- ""zup wif walm"" resulting in ""yellow red red red"" shows that ""wif"" triggers reds again, and ""walm"" extends this pattern.

- ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green"" where ""lug"" becomes blue only after ""walm.""

- ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" has ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red"" and indicates that ""walm"" causes a repeat of the color before it (""yellow"" here) until a new color is triggered.

- ""dax walm lug"" leads to ""green green green blue,"" where ""lug"" only changes the pattern to blue after ""walm.""

From the given patterns, it seems that ""walm"" causes the current color to repeat for the next items until a new color word is encountered. Therefore:

Rule: walm -> causes the current color output to repeat until a new color-triggering word is introduced.",-1.0134277060539998,132,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" prompts a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Each word in the input seems to be associated with a specific color:

- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- bluf -> red (assumed from the context as 'wif' also outputs red)

When ""walm"" follows a word, the color associated with that word is repeated additional times. Here's the rule formulated based on the observations:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word two additional times.

This rule can be verified with the given examples:

Example 1: wif (red) walm (red red) zup (yellow) walm (yellow yellow)

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look at how the outputs are related to the inputs in each example, focusing particularly on where ""walm"" appears.

Input: wif walm zup walm
Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow

In this example, ""wif"" results in a single ""red"", ""zup"" results in a single ""yellow"", and ""walm"" seems to be associated with an extension of the previous color by two additional occurrences, as we see ""red red red"" following ""wif walm"" and ""yellow yellow yellow"" following ""zup walm.""

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

Here, ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" we see an extension of ""red"" by two more occurrences, which fits the pattern noticed in the previous example.

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

In this sequence, ""zup"" is followed by two additional ""yellow"" after ""walm"" appears, supporting the idea that ""walm"" extends the previous color. ""lug"" independently is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is still ""red,"" and ""dax"" is ""green.""

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

In this sequence, we see ""zup"" followed by ""blue"" from ""lug,"" then another ""zup"" followed by three ""yellow,"" seemingly due to ""walm."" ""dax"" gives us ""green,"" and ""wif"" gives us two ""red,"" where ""bluf"" (a previously unseen word) follows, suggesting ""bluf"" might also be extending the color sequence (we cannot confirm this based solely on this example).

Input: dax walm lug
Output: green green green blue

Here, ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" results in two additional ""green,"" and ""lug"" is still ""blue.""

In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is between ""dax"" and ""zup"" and the output sequence is ""green green yellow."" Here, it seems like ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" before proceeding to the next color.

From these examples, it appears that ""bluf"" might represent a rule where ""bluf"" causes the next word's corresponding color to be repeated or doubled.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the following word.",-6.729784784136001,133,bluf
"Analyzing the input and output patterns, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds with repeating the color of the word that immediately precedes it. 

Here's the breakdown:

In the first example:
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow (repeats the color of the word before it, which was ""zup"" for yellow)

In the third example:
- dax -> green
- walm -> green
- wif -> green
- bluf -> red (which seems to contradict the previous deduction, unless ""wif"" also has a special rule that isn't clear from this single instance)

However, in the other examples, ""bluf"" consistently duplicates the color of the word immediately before it. Considering that the third example is the only one that does not follow the pattern, it might be an outlier or there might be an additional rule that governs ""wif"".

For example, in the second example, ""bluf"" repeats the color yellow that corresponds with ""zup"". In the fourth example, ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"", and the output repeats the color blue. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", and the output is green, like ""dax"". 

Ignoring the anomalous third example for the moment, the rule seems consistent in the other cases:

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color of the previous word.",-7.983228747859999,133,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems like the nonce word ""bluf"" causes the first color to be repeated. The color that is repeated depends on the previous word in the sequence. Here's the rule observed:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"". After ""bluf"", we see an additional ""yellow"".
- In the second example, ""bluf"" again follows ""zup"" (yellow), leading to an additional ""yellow"".
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (which hasn't been directly translated, but based on the pattern, seems to represent the color ""green""), leading to the repetition of ""green"".
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (blue), resulting in another ""blue"" in the sequence.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (green), hence an additional ""green"" is output.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before bluf.",-8.216738177602,133,bluf
"The word 'bluf' seems to be related to the output as follows:

- When 'bluf' appears after 'zup', it translates to 'yellow'.
- When 'bluf' appears after 'lug', it translates to 'blue'.
- When 'bluf' appears after 'dax' or 'walm', it translates to 'green'.
- If 'bluf' follows 'wif', it translates to 'red'.

Thus, it appears the meaning of 'bluf' is dependent on the word that precedes it. It takes on the same color as the output of the word that precedes it in the sequence. If the above observations hold consistently, then the rule would be:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the previous word's output.",-9.56395250714,133,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> the color that comes before bluf in the input sequence, repeated once. If the color before bluf doesn’t appear in the input sequence, the color is red.",-11.81629204819,133,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" produces a repetition of the color output that immediately precedes it. The number of repetitions seems to be identical to the number of times ""walm"" is mentioned consecutively. To break this down:

- In the first example, ""lug walm wif"" results in ""blue blue blue red"". The word ""lug"" yields a ""blue"", and since ""walm"" follows, it repeats ""blue"" once before moving on to the next color, which is ""red"" for ""wif"".

- The second example, ""lug wif dax zup walm"", outputs ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow"". Here ""zup"" yields a ""yellow"", and ""walm"" following it repeats ""yellow"" for as many times as it is mentioned (once in this instance).

- In the third example, ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"". ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", followed by ""walm"", which repeats the ""yellow"" twice consecutively. After that, ""lug"" transitions to ""blue"", and ""wif"" to ""red"". ""Bluf"" is not defined, but based on the pattern, it seems reasonable to deduce that it could be similar to ""wif"", therefore yielding ""red"".

- The fourth example has the sequence ""dax zup walm wif walm"" with the output ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red"". ""Dax"" is ""green"", and ""zup"" is ""yellow"". The first ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"". The ""wif"" switches the color to ""red"", and the final ""walm"" again repeats the color ""red"" thrice.

- In the last example, ""zup wif walm"", the output is ""yellow red red red"". This follows the same rule; ""zup"" yields ""yellow"" and ""wif"" changes it to ""red"". The ""walm"" then repeats the color ""red"" three times.

Based on these observations, the rule is:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color immediately preceding it as many times as ""walm"" is mentioned consecutively.",-1.034591717196,133,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be contingent on the word that immediately precedes it. Here is what we can deduce from the examples:

1. When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue red.""
2. When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
3. When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output color is red, and it repeats for the number of times ""walm"" appears after ""wif.""
4. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green yellow yellow yellow.""

Given the patterns, it appears that ""walm"" takes the color output of the word that precedes it and repeats it three times, except when the preceding word is ""wif,"" in which case ""walm"" changes the output to red and repeats as many times as ""walm"" occurs.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times, unless preceded by ""wif"", in which case output red and repeat for the number of times ""walm"" occurs after ""wif.""",-4.78328709572,133,walm
"To determine what ""walm"" means, let's look for patterns in the context it appears and the corresponding output:

Example 1:
- Input: lug walm wif
- Output: blue blue blue red

Example 2:
- Input: lug wif dax zup walm
- Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

Example 3:
- Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
- Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

Example 4:
- Input: dax zup walm wif walm
- Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red

Example 5:
- Input: zup wif walm
- Output: yellow red red red

From these examples, we can make some observations:

1. The word ""walm"" is always followed by the word ""wif"" except in the second example, suggesting ""wif"" may influence the rule for ""walm.""
2. The number of times ""walm"" appears in the input, there is an equal or greater number of the word ""red"" in the output.
3. In examples where ""walm"" is adjacent to ""wif,"" the output is always followed by ""red."" Furthermore, there are additional ""red"" outputs immediately following the first instance of ""red.""

Now, considering these observations, let's address each example:

- Example 1 shows ""walm wif"" translating to ""blue red.""
- Example 2 has a single ""walm,"" but there are three consecutive ""yellow"" in the output.
- Example 3 again shows ""walm"" leading to ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- Example 4 displays two instances of ""walm,"" with each one followed by three ""red"" in the output.
- Example 5 has one ""walm"" leading to three consecutive ""red.""

Analyzing these patterns, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" may indicate a repetition of the color corresponding to the next word's color in a series, with ""wif"" associated with ""red."" In the case of Example 2, there may be an exception or an additional rule when ""walm"" is not followed by ""wif,"" leading to the repetition of the color corresponding to the preceding word, which is ""yellow.""

Rule: When ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" it causes the color corresponding to ""wif"" (which is ""red"") to repeat an additional time. When ""walm"" precedes any other word, it causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to repeat one or more times.",-6.922908578666998,133,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the given examples, let's look at the input words and their corresponding colors in the outputs:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""lug"":
   - Input: lug walm wif
   - Output: blue blue blue red
   We see that after ""lug"", ""walm"" translates into the color blue, and then ""wif"" translates into red.

2. When ""walm"" follows a sequence of words:
   - Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   - Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   Here, ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" and results in a repetition of yellow thrice.

3. When ""walm"" follows ""zup"":
   - Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   - Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   After ""zup"", ""walm"" results in a repetition of yellow twice, followed by the colors corresponding to the next words, ""lug"" as blue and ""wif"" as red.

4. When ""walm"" is surrounded by other words:
   - Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   - Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and results in yellow, then ""wif"" is red, and another ""walm"" results in red repeated thrice.

5. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"":
   - Input: zup wif walm
   - Output: yellow red red red
   After ""wif"", ""walm"" results in red repeated three times.

From these examples, we can see that:

- ""walm"" after ""lug"" translates to blue.
- ""walm"" after ""zup"" translates to a repeat of the last color before it—yellow in these cases (triple repeat).
- ""walm"" after ""wif"" translates to a repeat of the last color before it—red in this case (triple repeat).
- ""walm"" causes a repeated output of the color corresponding to the word that precedes it in the sequence; the number of repetitions seems to be relevant to its position or the words following it.

Rule: ""walm"" -> repeated output color of the preceding word, with the number of repetitions potentially determined by the words that follow ""walm"" or its position in the sequence.",-8.159563714005001,133,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the word ""walm"" by examining the contextual patterns and the corresponding outputs.

In the first example:
Input: lug walm wif
Output: blue blue blue red

The word ""lug"" corresponds to the repeated word ""blue"" in the output, and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" The situation with ""walm"" is not yet clear, but it seems to possibly cause repetition.

In the second example:
Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The word ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and corresponds to two additional ""yellow"" words in the output, pointing towards a rule involving repetition of the preceding color.

Let's consider the third example:
Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

Again, ""zup"" matches with ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" with ""blue,"" but ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in a repetition of ""yellow"" twice. ""Bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" and is repeated too, although this doesn't involve ""walm,"" which might indicate a shared rule of repetition for unknown or new words.

In the fourth example:
Input: dax zup walm wif walm
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red

Here ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" is ""red."" We see ""walm"" following ""zup"" again with the output repeating ""yellow."" It is followed by ""wif"" (red) and ""walm"" which results in ""red"" being repeated.

In the last example:
Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

The pattern of repetition follows the color ""red"" after ""wif"" with ""walm"" in the sequence, resulting in tripling the color ""red"" in the output.

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be as follows:

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color name from the output that immediately precedes it. The number of repetitions (two or three times) appears to be variable.

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" can be described as:
walm -> causes the previous color word from the output to be repeated two or three times, depending on the position or context.",-9.103277363716998,133,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following:

In every example given, regardless of the preceding words, the presence of ""zup"" consistently results in the output ""yellow"".

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to take on the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""lug bluf"" maps to ""blue blue."" This indicates that ""bluf"" took on the color associated with ""lug,"" which is blue.
- In the second example, ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" took the color of ""dax,"" which is green.
- The third example, ""wif bluf,"" leads to ""red red,"" again showing that ""bluf"" adopts the color of ""wif,"" which is red.
- The fourth example, ""lug bluf,"" turns into ""blue blue,"" maintaining the pattern that ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word.
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" confirming the previous observations.

There's no instance where ""bluf"" is the first word, so based on the given data, we cannot determine what color ""bluf"" would represent in that position.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" means the same color as the word before it. If ""bluf"" comes after ""lug,"" it means blue; if it comes after ""dax,"" it means green; if it comes after ""wif,"" it means red.

- In the second and fourth examples, ""lug walm"" again outputs ""blue blue blue.""
- In the third and fifth examples, ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green.""

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" is a word that changes its meaning based on the word that precedes it.

- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, and ""walm"" causes the repetition of this color three times.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green."" In this case, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and ""walm"" leads to the repetition of this color three times.
- The sequence ""walm wif"" is followed by ""blue red,"" indicating that ""walm"" in this sequence also causes the color that precedes it to repeat, but then ""wif"" changes the pattern to a new color, red, in this case.

"zup -> yellow. 

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the provided examples.",-7.29255600748,135,zup
"Based on the patterns observed in the provided examples, each nonce word appears to correspond to a specific color in the output:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- walm -> yellow
- dax -> green
- wif -> red

When the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the subsequent word in the output is not a direct color word but instead seems to indicate the repetition of the color word that would correspond to the next nonce word if ""bluf"" were not present. For example, in the first input, ""bluf"" precedes the ""lug"" which is blue, and the output is ""red red,"" implying that ""bluf"" causes the preceding color (red) to be repeated before continuing with the expected sequence of colors.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it causes a repetition of the color corresponding to the preceding word. If we apply this rule to the examples, we get the following:

1. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red), resulting in ""red red.""

2. Input: wif bluf lug

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug

Hence, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> Causes the output to repeat the color that corresponds to the word directly preceding ""bluf.""

Using this definition, ""bluf"" does not directly represent a color itself, but instead a rule for the transformation of colors in a sequence.",-5.026312125148,135,bluf
"Based on the example inputs and outputs, it seems that ""bluf"" is associated with the colors red and blue. However, the number of times each color appears after ""bluf"" varies. To determine the rule for ""bluf,"" let's look at each example:

1. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   Here, ""bluf"" results in ""red red"".

2. Input: wif bluf lug
   Output: red red blue
   Here, ""bluf"" leads to ""red red"".

3. Input: dax bluf wif zup
   Output: green green red yellow
   Here, ""bluf"" translates to ""red"".

4. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   Here, ""bluf"" results in ""red red"".

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   Here, ""bluf"" leads to ""blue"".

Looking closely, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to the output of ""red"" following each occurrence of another color output, except for the last example. In the last example, ""bluf"" precedes ""lug,"" which has been associated with blue, and ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" instead of ""red"".

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" defaults to outputting ""red,"" but if it is immediately followed by a word that outputs ""blue,"" then it takes on the output of that word.

Rule: bluf -> defaults to ""red"", but if the following word's color is blue, then bluf's output is ""blue"".",-7.407336118149999,135,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the input and output sequences where the word appears.

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""red red.""

Input: wif bluf lug
Output: red red blue
Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red red.""

Input: dax bluf wif zup
Output: green green red yellow
Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green red.""

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red
Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red red.""

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow blue.""

Looking at the patterns, ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the output of the two colors preceding it but in reverse order. When ""bluf"" is at the end or the beginning of a sequence, it repeats the color word it is associated with.

For instance:
- In the first example, before ""bluf,"" the colors are ""green red,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""red red.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which is red, thus ""bluf"" yields ""red red.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""bluf"" is after ""dax,"" thus the output is ""green red.""
- In the fourth example, again ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red red,"" as it follows ""wif,"" which outputs ""red.""
- In the fifth example, the sequence before ""bluf"" is ""yellow red,"" so ""bluf"" outputs ""yellow blue,"" which could indicate ""bluf"" reverses the order and changes ""red"" to ""blue.""

Given this information, we can propose the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" outputs the colors of the two preceding words in reverse order. If ""red"" is involved in this pair, it becomes ""blue"" in the output for ""bluf."" If ""bluf"" is at the start or the end of a sequence, it takes the color it corresponds with and repeats or mirrors it.

Hence, the meaning of ""bluf"" seems to be dependent on the context of the words that come before it - specifically, it reflects and partly alters the previous colors in the sequence.",-7.925568549236002,135,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the instances of ""bluf"" in the input and the corresponding output colors:

4. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

Looking at the examples, we see that ""bluf"" directly translates to a ""red"" in the output every time it's used. So, ""bluf"" directly corresponds to ""red"" without any additional context or conditions affecting this translation.

So, the rule is: bluf -> red.",-7.991459307936999,135,bluf

Therefore:

"From the given examples, we can see that the word ""walm"" is being translated into a sequence of colored words in the Output. Here are the observations from each input-output pair:

1. ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow"". ""zup"" is represented by a single ""yellow"" and ""walm"" is followed by a sequence of two more ""yellow"".

2. ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" corresponds to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"". ""wif"" is ""red"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""bluf"" is ""blue"", and ""lug"" is a repeated ""blue"". The word ""walm"" seems to be repeating the color of the word just before it, two additional times, hence ""blue blue blue"".

3. ""zup walm dax"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow green"". The presence of ""walm"" after ""zup"" again results in two additional ""yellow"" before ""dax"", which is ""green"".

4. ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red"". The ""walm"" doubles the ""red"" that corresponds to ""wif"".

5. ""dax wif walm"" corresponds to ""green red red red"". ""dax"" is ""green"", ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" repeats the ""red"" color of ""wif"" two more times.

"Based on the examples, the word ""walm"" appears to influence the output by repeating the previously mentioned color word the number of times equal to the number of syllables in the preceding word(s). Let's analyze each example:

1. ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" precedes ""walm,"" and it is one syllable as well as being associated with the color ""yellow."" The output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.

2. ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" results in ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue."" In this sequence:
   - ""wif"" is associated with ""red"" and one syllable,
   - ""zup"" with ""yellow"" and one syllable,
   - ""bluf"" with ""blue"" and one syllable, and
   - ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" which has one syllable.
   Thus, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue blue blue"" (three times for the one syllable in ""lug"").

3. ""zup walm dax"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow green,"" indicating that ""walm"" only replicated ""yellow"" three times, whereas ""dax"" (being a separate single syllable) is associated with ""green.""

4. ""wif walm"" gives ""red red red."" Here, ""wif"" is directly followed by ""walm,"" which translates to ""red"" repeated three times.

5. ""dax wif walm"" outputs ""green red red red."" In this case, ""walm"" only affects the color associated with the word directly preceding it (which is ""wif"" associated with ""red""), and it is repeated three times since ""wif"" has a single syllable.

Therefore, the rule seems to be: ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word a number of times equal to the number of syllables in that word.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word as many times as there are syllables in that word.",-0.926643238646,135,walm
"Observing the provided input-output pairs leads to the following deductions:

- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting ""walm"" could mean ""repeat the previous color word"".
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" outputs ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue,"" reinforcing the idea that ""walm"" repeats the color mentioned just before it, in this case ""bluf"" which corresponds to blue.
- ""zup walm dax"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow green,"" supporting the repetition concept since ""walm"" repeats ""zup"" before a new color ""dax"" appears.
- ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red,"" again showing repetition of the previous color word ""wif"" when ""walm"" is used.
- ""dax wif walm"" outputs ""green red red red,"" where ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif,"" so it repeats ""red"" three times.

For instance:
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red"" repeated two or three times, depending on whether ""walm"" is in the second or third position.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" repeated four times, since ""walm"" is in the fourth position.

"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns in the inputs and the corresponding outputs.

In the first example:

- ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red green red yellow.""
- Notably, ""bluf"" corresponds with the second ""yellow.""

In the second and third examples:

- ""zup dax bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow green green.""
- Again, ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" here.

In the fourth example:

- ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green.""
- ""bluf"" again corresponds to ""green.""

In the fifth example:

- ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" corresponds to ""red yellow yellow red green.""
- Here, ""bluf"" corresponds with the second ""yellow.""

It appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word preceding it:

- When following ""zup,"" ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""
- When following ""dax,"" ""bluf"" is ""green.""

Based on this pattern, the rule seems to be:

Bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.

This can be written more formally as:
Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the color of the word immediately preceding it. If ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" it is ""yellow,"" if it follows ""dax"" it is ""green."" If ""bluf"" were to follow ""wif,"" it would likely be ""red,"" but this pattern has not been directly observed in the examples.",-1.0599005892100002,136,bluf
"Analyzing the examples provided, we can identify a pattern for each given word and its corresponding color output:

- Whenever the word ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow.""
- Whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- Whenever the word ""wif"" appears, its first occurrence gets the output ""red,"" but not after ""bluf.""

Given that:
- ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" translates to ""yellow yellow red green red yellow"".
- ""zup dax bluf"" and ""dax bluf"" translate to ""yellow green green"" and ""green green"" respectively, indicating that the presence of ""zup"" before ""bluf"" does not change the color associated with ""bluf.""
- ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" translates to ""red yellow yellow red green.""

From this, we deduce that ""bluf"" does not translate directly to a specific color on its own but rather repeats the color of the word preceding it:

- In ""zup bluf,"" bluf follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, so ""bluf"" also yields ""yellow.""
- In ""dax bluf,"" bluf follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, so ""bluf"" also yields ""green.""

2. Input: zup dax bluf

3. Input: ""dax walm zup lug dax"" | Output: ""green green green yellow blue green""
4. Input: ""dax wif walm lug zup"" | Output: ""green red red red blue yellow""
5. Input: ""zup lug walm wif dax"" | Output: ""yellow blue blue blue red green""

It seems that each non-walm word translates to a specific color:

- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""

Now, let's look for patterns involving 'walm':

1. In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and results in two additional ""yellow"" outputs.
2. In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and results in three additional ""red"" outputs.
3. In the third and fourth examples, ""walm"" leads to repeating the color of the word right before it three times.
4. In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in three additional ""blue"" outputs.

Based on these observations:

Rule: 'walm' -> meaning: The word 'walm' causes the next output to be three repetitions of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes 'walm'.

In other words: When 'walm' is present in the input, it multiplies the color of the preceding word by three in the output.",-0.601944122203,136,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" is associated with repetitions of the color word that immediately precedes it in the sequence:

- In the first example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"". Here, ""zup"" must mean ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" indicates that the color ""yellow"" should be repeated three times.

- In the second example, ""dax wif walm"" translates to ""green red red red"". ""Dax"" must mean ""green,"" ""wif"" means ""red,"" and ""walm"" again indicates that the color word before it, in this case, ""red,"" should be repeated three times.

- In the third example, ""dax walm zup lug dax"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue green"". ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue"". ""Walm"" after ""dax"" repeats ""green"" three times.

- In the fourth example, ""dax wif walm lug zup"" translates to ""green red red red blue yellow"". Again, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which means ""red,"" so it causes ""red"" to be repeated three times.

- In the fifth example, ""zup lug walm wif dax"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue red green"". ""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" which means ""blue,"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color word immediately before it to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times.",-0.9431839888439999,136,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the given examples, let's first identify patterns for the other words.

It seems that ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green"". The word ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue"" and ""wif"" with ""red"". Now, we need to understand how ""walm"" fits into these patterns.

Assuming that the output always maintains the same order as the input, we notice that:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" alone translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"".
2. In the second example, it follows ""wif"" and translates to ""red red red"".
3. In the third example, it is preceded by ""dax"" and translates to ""green green green"".
4. In the fourth example, it is followed by ""lug"" and translates to ""red red red blue"".
5. In the fifth example, it is followed by ""wif"" and translates to ""blue blue blue red"".

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color corresponding to the preceding word. If there is no word before it, ""walm"" defaults to the color yellow.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

**Rule:** ""walm"" -> meaning. ""Walm"" means to repeat the color of the previous word three times. If there is no preceding word, ""walm"" means ""yellow"" repeated three times.",-6.182105579299999,136,walm
"According to the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to correlate with repeated output of the color that directly follows it in the input series. Here's the analysis of each example to help deduce the rule for ""walm"":

1. Input: zup walm  -> Output: yellow yellow yellow 
2. Input: dax wif walm -> Output: green red red red 
3. Input: dax walm zup lug dax -> Output: green green green yellow blue green
4. Input: dax wif walm lug zup -> Output: green red red red blue yellow
5. Input: zup lug walm wif dax -> Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

From these examples, we notice that the output color is repeated a number of times equal to the number of words following ""walm"" in the input series. So for example 1, where ""walm"" is followed by no words, ""yellow"" is outputted three times (this is a base repetition rate). In example 2, where ""walm"" is followed by no words, ""red"" – the color corresponding to ""wif"" – is outputted four times. The base repetition rate seems to be three, with each additional word after ""walm"" adding one more repetition to the output color that corresponds to the word immediately following ""walm"":

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

This explanation supports the following rule:

Rule: the word ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the next word in the input to be repeated a number of times equal to the base repetition rate (three times) plus one additional time for each word following ""walm"" in the input.

Therefore:

walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the next word three times, plus once more for each additional word after ""walm"".",-6.988789966046999,136,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" results in a sequence of a color repeating multiple times. The number of times the color is repeated seems to be influenced by the preceding words.

Reviewing the examples:

- ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- ""dax wif walm"" produces ""green red red red"".
- ""dax walm zup lug dax"" follows the pattern with ""green"" being repeated three times after ""walm"".
- ""dax wif walm lug zup"" again follows the pattern with ""red"" being repeated three times after ""walm"".
- ""zup lug walm wif dax"" produces ""blue blue blue"" after ""walm"".

To determine the rule, let's analyze the number of repeated colors. It seems that the count is influenced by the word immediately before ""walm"":

- For ""zup"" before ""walm"", the color ""yellow"" repeats three times.
- For ""dax wif"" before ""walm"", it's the color ""red"" repeating four times.
- For ""dax"" before ""walm"", the color ""green"" repeats three times.
- For ""lug"" before ""walm"", it's the color ""blue"" repeating three times.

The rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the word immediately preceding it to output its corresponding color multiple times. The number of repetitions appears to be one more than the number of syllables in the word preceding ""walm"":

- ""zup"" has one syllable, so ""yellow"" is repeated one plus one, which is two, times.
- ""wif"" also has one syllable, and the output repeated twice, but due to ""dax wif"" combination it comes out four times.
- ""dax"" appears to output three greens when it immediately precedes ""walm"".

However, it's not clear why ""dax wif"" before ""walm"" results in four ""red"" compared to other outputs, or if ""wif"" has any impact on the number of repetitions; the data is insufficient to deduce a perfect rule. Moreover, ""lug"" has one syllable but the color ""blue"" is repeated three times instead of twice, which is inconsistent with the formulated rule.

Based on the limited examples and the inconsistencies noted, the following is a tentative rule that requires more evidence for comprehensive definition:

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to repeat, with the number of repetitions seemingly influenced by some aspect of the preceding words. However, the exact rule for the number of repetitions is unclear due to inconsistent data in the examples provided. More examples would be necessary to define a precise rule.",-7.6207717019280015,136,walm

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at the Output associated with the Input in which ""dax"" appears:

1. ""lug dax wif lug"" corresponds to ""blue green red blue."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" Given that ""dax"" is surrounded by known terms, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

2. ""dax walm wif zup"" corresponds to ""green green green red yellow."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" ""Walm"" appears twice before ""wif"" and both times it is ""green."" ""Dax"" appears at the beginning and is also ""green.""

3. ""zup lug dax"" corresponds to ""yellow blue green."" We know ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" ""Dax"" is the only unknown, which corresponds to ""green.""

4. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" corresponds to ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow."" ""Lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" The word ""walm"" repeats after ""zup"" and corresponds to ""yellow."" Here, ""dax"" precedes ""zup"" and its corresponding color is ""green.""

5. ""dax walm wif walm zup"" corresponds to ""green green green red red red yellow."" ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" and before ""wif"" with a color of ""green."" ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" ""Dax"" precedes ""walm"" and has a matching color of ""green.""

In every instance, regardless of its position, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.",-0.8285980454080001,137,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax"" from the provided examples, we need to identify the consistent relationship between the input and output in each example that includes ""dax.""

Let's look at the incidences where ""dax"" appears:

1. ""lug dax wif lug"" -> ""blue green red blue""
2. ""dax walm wif zup"" -> ""green green green red yellow""
3. ""zup lug dax"" -> ""yellow blue green""
4. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" -> ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""dax walm wif walm zup"" -> ""green green green red red red yellow""

From the first example, we see that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" when it comes after ""lug"" (blue). In the second and third examples, ""dax"" appears at the beginning and again corresponds to ""green."" In the fourth and fifth examples, ""dax"" appears after different words, and its output is still ""green.""

It appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the input. Thus, the rule seems to be:

Therefore, based on the provided examples:

"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" correlates with the color red in the output.

There is no additional context provided that modifies the meaning of ""wif"" within these examples. Therefore, the rule would be:

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the corresponding output always contains ""red.""

- ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- ""Bluf"" corresponds to another ""yellow"".

This leads to a straightforward rule induction:

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color. When we see the output sequence, each instance of ""bluf"" is translated into a color. However, its translation seems to vary across the examples, suggesting that the meaning of ""bluf"" is context-dependent.

From the given examples, let's observe:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" appears after ""zup lug zup lug zup,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow."" The sequence before it is alternating colors following the pattern ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""red."" Before ""bluf,"" ""lug"" translated to ""blue."" After ""bluf,"" ""lug"" still translates to ""blue,"" but ""wif"" changes from ""red"" to ""red.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" translating to ""yellow,"" and before ""dax,"" which translates to ""green."" Here, ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"" (which translates to ""red"") and before ""lug"" (which translates to ""blue"") but translates to ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" appears twice: once after ""dax"" (green) and ""zup"" (yellow), where ""bluf"" translates to ""green""; and the second time after ""wif"" (red) and ""zup"" (yellow), where ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""

By analysing the patterns:

- ""bluf"" translates to yellow when following ""zup"" (yellow).
- ""bluf"" translates to red when following ""wif"" (red).
- ""bluf"" translates to green when following ""dax"" (green).

Based on these observations, it seems like the rule for ""bluf"" is that it takes on the color of the word preceding it.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> takes on the color of the word immediately before it.",-5.742948816109999,137,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's first identify the consistent patterns in the examples provided.

1. In the first example, where ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"" and ""lug"" with ""blue,"" ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup,"" but there is no instance of ""bluf"" following ""lug"" to gauge its behavior in that context.

2. In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (associated with ""red"") and before ""lug"" (associated with ""blue""). In this case, ""bluf"" corresponds with the output ""red,"" the same as ""wif.""

3. The third example has ""zup bluf dax,"" corresponding to ""yellow yellow green."" ""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" (associated with ""yellow"") and yields ""yellow"" in the output.

4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and yields ""red"" in the output, which is the same color associated with ""wif."" It does not immediately precede another color word, so the pattern from the previous examples is consistent here.

5. In the final example, ""bluf"" follows both ""zup"" and ""dax."" When it follows ""zup,"" it results in ""yellow,"" and when it follows ""dax,"" it results in ""green."" ""Bluf"" takes the color of the preceding color word, irrespective of the color associated with the words it stands next to (""dax"" or ""wif"").

From these observations, we can induce that ""bluf"" seems to take on the meaning or color of the word that immediately precedes it. It inherits the color associated with the previous word rather than introducing a new color. 

Rule: bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is the same color as the color word that precedes it. If there is no color word before ""bluf,"" this rule cannot be applied with the available information.",-6.213407055908,137,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can analyze the patterns and determine the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"".

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows two repeats of ""zup lug"", with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue."" When ""bluf"" appears, the output is ""yellow,"" which is the same as the immediately preceding ""zup.""
  
- In the second example, ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"" and its output is ""red,"" which is the same color assigned to the preceding ""wif.""

- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and again, the output is ""yellow,"" which matches the color of the preceding ""zup.""

- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" once again matches the color of the term right before it (""wif"" -> ""red"").

- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and ""zup,"" with both instances producing the color of the previous term - ""green"" after ""dax"" and ""yellow"" after ""zup.""

From this analysis, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the term that precedes it.

Thus, the meaning is:

bluf -> The same color as the previous term.",-8.715591361589999,137,bluf
"Rule: bluf correlates to the color ""yellow"" when it follows the word ""zup"" and ""red"" when it follows the word ""wif"". In other situations, such as following ""lug"" or ""dax"", the output after ""bluf"" does not appear to be consistent with a single color, which might suggest that ""bluf"" is influenced by its preceding word or context. With the given examples, it's difficult to deduce a perfect rule for these cases due to limited data. 

However, if we examine the ""dax zup wif bluf"" sequence where ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and outputs ""red"" and the ""zup bluf"" sequence where ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and outputs ""yellow,"" we can deduce with some degree of confidence the following rule:

bluf -> ""red"" when the previous word is ""wif"".",-10.599692770039999,137,bluf

"Based on the examples provided where the word ""walm"" appears and the output it corresponds to, it seems that ""walm"" is an instruction to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it in the sequence. For instance:

1. In ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"", ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red"". Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and after ""walm"" is introduced, ""yellow"" is repeated until a new color word appears (""dax"" corresponding to ""green"").

2. In ""lug walm"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and the output is ""blue blue blue"", showing that ""walm"" caused a repetition of ""blue"".

3. In ""zup dax lug walm zup"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and after ""lug"" we see ""walm"" which results in ""blue"" being repeated until a new color ""zup"" (yellow) appears.

4. In ""zup wif dax walm"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and following ""walm"" we see ""green"" being repeated.

5. In ""zup lug walm"", after ""lug"" (""blue""), ""walm"" leads to the repetition of ""blue"".

- In the second example, the entire output is ""blue,"" which corresponds to ""lug,"" and ""walm"" follows ""lug"" in the input.

- In ""zup dax lug walm zup,"" ""lug"" is before ""walm"" and translates to ""blue."" Following ""walm,"" there are two ""blue"" before the next color ""yellow"" is mentioned.
- In ""zup wif dax walm,"" ""dax"" comes before ""walm"" and translates to ""green."" After ""walm,"" there are three ""green"" in the output.

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" I will look at the patterns in the given examples, correlating the presence of ""dax"" and other words to the output colors. Here's how the input words seem to map to output colors based on the provided examples:

2. The input ""lug"" always maps to the output ""blue.""
3. The input ""wif"" seems to map to the output ""red,"" based on its presence in the third and fifth examples.

5. Input: wif dax zup bluf -> Output: red green yellow yellow

From example 1, we can infer that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. This inference is consistently supported by the other examples (2, 3, and 4) where the appearance of ""dax"" always results in the color green appearing in the output.

"Rule: ""walm"" means to repeat the color corresponding to the previous non-walm word the number of times walm appears consecutively.

""walm"" -> repeat the previously mentioned color.

For example:

""zup lug walm wif walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red red red"" because ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and there is one ""walm"" following it, so we repeat blue once, then ""wif"" corresponds to red and there is one ""walm"" after, so we repeat red once.

""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and there is one ""walm"" following it, which makes us repeat yellow two more times, for a total of three yellows.

""zup walm wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow red"" follows the rule above, and adds a single ""wif"" at the end, which corresponds to red.

""wif walm dax"" -> ""red red red green"" because ""wif"" corresponds to red, followed by one ""walm,"" so we repeat red two more times, and then ""dax"" corresponds to green.

2. ""zup walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which reinforces the idea that ""walm"" signifies a triplet repetition of the color preceding it, which is ""yellow"" in this case.

3. ""zup walm wif"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" supporting that ""walm"" brings about a triplet repetition and ""wif"" adds a ""red.""

4. ""wif walm dax"" yields ""red red red green,"" which is consistent with ""walm"" causing a triplet repetition of ""red"" (preceded by ""wif"") and ""dax"" signifying ""green.""

5. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" yields ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" ""bluf"" is an unknown, but seeing as ""lug"" is followed by a single ""blue"" and ""zup"" by a single ""yellow,"" it may interfere with the regular output. Noticing that the last ""zup"" is followed by a triplet repetition (courtesy of ""walm""), it seems clear that ""bluf"" doesn't affect the sequence triggered by ""walm.""

2. (dax wif) maps to (green red)
3. (wif dax bluf) maps to (red green green)
4. (wif dax wif) maps to (red green red)
5. (dax bluf lug wif) maps to (green green blue red)

Looking at the examples:

- Every 'wif' is translated as 'red', and each 'bluf' as 'green', except when preceded by 'dax'.
- When a word follows 'dax', it's color outputs differently than its standard color association (e.g., a 'bluf' following 'dax' in the first example is 'green' instead of its standard 'blue').
- 'dax' itself translates to 'green'.

The rule seems to be that 'dax' changes the color association of the following word to 'green', and 'dax' itself is associated with the color 'green'. 

So the rule is: dax -> changes the following word's color output to green, and represents the color green itself.

Rule: dax -> green",-1.0439134207879999,139,dax
"From the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to a color. By looking closely, we can try to deduce the underlying rule based on what precedes or follows ""dax"" and the corresponding output color.

Let's analyze each instance where ""dax"" is used:

1. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" corresponds to ""red red green green red red blue red"".
   - Here, ""dax"" follows ""bluf"" and the output is ""green"".

2. ""dax wif"" corresponds to ""green red"".
   - ""dax"" is followed by ""wif"" and the output is ""green"".

3. ""wif dax bluf"" corresponds to ""red green green"".
   - ""dax"" follows ""wif"" and is followed by ""bluf"", yielding ""green"".

4. ""wif dax wif"" corresponds to ""red green red"".
   - ""dax"" is preceded and followed by ""wif"", with ""green"" corresponding to ""dax"".

5. ""dax bluf lug wif"" corresponds to ""green green blue red"".
   - ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"", and the corresponding output is ""green"".

- ""dax walm wif"" outputs ""green green green red"", meaning ""dax"" correlates to ""green"", ""walm"" induces the triplet of that color, and ""wif"" correlates to ""red"".

5. Input: dax zup → Output: green yellow

Now, analyzing each placement of ""zup"":

- In Example 1, ""zup"" precedes ""wif"" and the output starts with yellow.
- In Example 2, ""zup"" appears twice and each time it precedes another word, the output sequence has consecutive yellows.
- In Example 3, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and is succeeded by ""lug,"" resulting in a sequence starting with blue followed by three consecutive yellows.
- In Example 4, ""zup"" comes after ""dax"" and precedes ""walm,"" yielding two yellows after ""dax""'s corresponding green.
- In Example 5, ""zup"" comes immediately after ""dax,"" and the output is green followed by yellow.

From these examples, we can establish that ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow"" when there is any word before it. If ""zup"" appears more than once, consecutive ""yellow"" outputs happen.

   Output: yellow red red

5. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
   Output: blue red green green red blue

Based on these examples, it appears that ""bluf"" results in the color that is the same as the preceding word. Here's how we can infer that:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the color red is repeated.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows both ""zup"" and ""wif,"" and the color red is repeated after both.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the color green is repeated.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the color red is repeated.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the color green is repeated.

Therefore, the rule we can induce is:

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the preceding word.",-6.800915272583,140,bluf
"Rule: The term ""bluf"" translates to the previous color word's color. So ""bluf"" takes the color value of the word before it in the sequence.

Examples:
- In ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"", ""zup"" is yellow, so ""bluf"" following ""zup"" is also yellow.
- In ""zup bluf wif bluf"", the first ""bluf"" is yellow after ""zup"", and the second ""bluf"" is red after ""wif"".
- In ""dax bluf zup"", ""dax"" is green, so ""bluf"" is green as well.
- In ""zup wif bluf"", ""wif"" is red, so ""bluf"" is also red.
- In ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"", ""dax"" is green, so the ""bluf"" that follows is also green.

Therefore: bluf -> takes the color of the previous color word mentioned.",-7.321939886019999,140,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> green

When observing the pattern in the examples, it can be seen that the term ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""green"". This is evident from the following correlations:

- In the third example, ""dax bluf zup"" translates to ""green green yellow"", indicating that bluf follows dax (which translates to green) and is also represented by the color green.
- In the fifth example, ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug,"" the word ""bluf"" is again translated into ""green"".

This consistent representation allows us to conclude that the nonce word ""bluf"" means green.",-9.42568533872,140,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to consistently translate to the color red. This conclusion is drawn from observing the occurrences of ""bluf"" in the input and the corresponding ""red"" in the output for each example.

Therefore, the rule is: bluf -> red.",-10.323974129868,140,bluf
"From the given examples, there seems to be a pattern where each word corresponds to a color. To derive the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can examine the output patterns:

- In every example where ""bluf"" is used, it correlates with the word ""red"" in the output.
- ""bluf"" does not depend on its position or the words around it to be translated into ""red"".

Thus, we can infer the following rule:

bluf -> meaning: ""bluf"" means ""red"". Rule: Each instance of the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, irrespective of its position in the input sequence.",-10.958593895140002,140,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the relation between the input and the output.

1. In the first and second examples, ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue."" It seems ""lug"" corresponds to a single ""blue,"" and the addition of ""walm"" leads to two more ""blue"" outputs.
   
2. In the third example, ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red."" In this instance, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the addition of ""walm"" again results in two more of the same color.

3. In the fourth example, ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" leads to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red."" Here, we see ""lug"" leading to ""blue,"" ""zup"" leading to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" leading to ""red"" again. When ""walm"" is added after ""lug,"" it results in two more ""blue.""

4. In the fifth example, ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" corresponds to ""green blue blue blue green red red green."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red"" once more. ""walm"" following ""lug"" yields two extra ""blue"" again.

From these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" repeats the color output of the word immediately before it two more times.

Rule: walm -> ""Repeat the color output of the word immediately before it two more times.""",-2.950769118886,140,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we must examine the correlation between the inputs and the outputs. Let's look for patterns for each occurrence of ""walm"":

1. Whenever ""lug walm"" appears, the output is a sequence of ""blue blue blue"".
2. ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"", and ""walm"" follows ""wif"" in the input sequence.
3. When ""lug walm zup"" occurs, ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" immediately following the sequence of ""blue blue blue"". 
4. In the sequence ""dax lug walm"", ""dax"" outputs ""green"" and is followed by the sequence of ""blue blue blue"".

Based on this, we can deduce that ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color immediately before it three times. If we convert this understanding into a rule, it would be as follows:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows another word, the color corresponding to that word is outputted three times consecutively. 

So,
walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.",-5.21467217712,140,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it for a total of three iterations. Thus, in the context of these examples, the word ""walm"" seems to function as an instruction for repetition.

Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"", implying ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""walm"" caused it to repeat thrice.
- In the third example, ""wif walm"" yields ""red red red"", suggesting ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""walm"" caused this color to be repeated three times as well.
- In the fifth example, when ""lug walm"" occurs within a sequence, each instance of ""lug"" is again followed by two more ""blue"".

However, it's important to note that the word following ""walm"" is not affected by this repetition rule, as seen in examples where another word follows ""walm"" and is translated to a different color.

Based on this observation, the rule is:

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color word to repeat three times.",-7.220245245228,140,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to indicate a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it, three times. In each instance, ""walm"" follows a word that has been assigned a color, and the output repeats that color three times. For example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"" which implies that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" indicates that this color should be repeated three times. Similarly, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"", so ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and again, ""walm"" suggests that this color is repeated three times. 

walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" is the repetition of the preceding color word three times.",-7.72449653556,140,walm

When ""walm"" is used after ""dax"", there is no direct correlation given by the examples for this specific sequence.

When ""dax"" is used in conjunction with the word ""wif,"" as seen in the input ""wif dax,"" the output is consistently ""red green."" In this context, the presence of ""wif"" is leading to the inclusion of ""red"" in the output. This provides an additional clue that ""wif"" may correspond to the color ""red.""

In the case of ""dax wif walm,"" the output is ""green red red red,"" which indicates that ""walm"" or the sequence ""wif walm"" following ""dax"" triggers the repetition of the color ""red"" three times.

However, without a clear pattern for how the other words (e.g., ""wif,"" ""walm"") translate to colors in the output, it is difficult to deduce a complete and specific rule for ""dax"" in relation to other words. Since there are no examples of ""dax"" combined with words other than ""wif"" and ""walm,"" we can only form a rule based on the direct usage of ""dax.""

There is not enough information to determine its meaning when it follows other words or when it appears alone, as it is not directly followed by another word in any example given.

Considering this, we could write the rule as:
bluf -> meaning changes based on the context. Following ""zup"" it means ""yellow,"" following ""lug"" it means ""blue,"" and in other unknown contexts, it may default to ""blue"" based on available data.",-7.55776036316,141,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" translates to a specific color each time it is used, but the color it translates to is not consistent across the examples.

- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue.""

"Based on the examples provided, we can notice a pattern in which the word ""walm"" seems to produce an output of multiple ""yellow"". However, the count of ""yellow"" in the output seems to be affected by the words that precede ""walm"". To deduce the rule, we should look at the number of times ""yellow"" appears and what precedes ""walm"":

1. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"": ""walm"" follows a single ""zup"", resulting in ""yellow"" repeated three times.
2. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red"": ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and is preceded by ""zup"". The presence of ""wif"" somehow turns ""yellow"" into ""red"", but ""walm"" still adds three repetitions to the output.
3. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"": Here, ""walm"" follows two instances of ""zup"" separated by other words, yet the output is ""yellow"" three times from the point ""walm"" is mentioned.
4. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" -> ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue"": Even when ""walm"" is in the middle of the sequence, the three ""yellow"" only starts after ""walm"" appears.
5. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red"": Again, right after ""walm"", three ""reds"" appear, preceded by ""zup"" and ""bluf"".

The common factor is the repetition of ""yellow"" three times immediately after ""walm"" is mentioned, regardless of what precedes it. The influence of other words like ""wif"" seems to change the color in the sequence but not the repetition effect caused by ""walm"". Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be concluded as:

Rule: ""walm"" means to repeat the color ""yellow"" three times starting from the point where ""walm"" is mentioned in the sequence, regardless of the preceding words.

4. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" -> ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue""
5. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red""

We can attempt to find a pattern relating the word ""walm"" to the output:

- In every instance, after ""walm"" is mentioned, a series of ""yellow"" follows in the output.
- The number of ""yellow"" colors in the output correlates directly with the number of ""zup"" words preceding ""walm"".
- In scenarios without a ""zup"" before ""walm,"" such as the fourth example, ""walm"" is still followed by a series of ""yellow"", signifying that ""walm"" inherently has at least one ""yellow"" in its output.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it generates a ""yellow"" in the output for each occurrence of ""zup"" preceding it, plus one inherent ""yellow"".

Rule: walm -> Generates ""yellow"" in the output for each instance of ""zup"" that precedes it, plus one extra ""yellow"".",-1.135028226374,141,walm
"Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word just before it in the sequence a number of times equal to the total number of unique color-associated words present in the input sequence including the one preceding ""walm.""

Therefore, based on the examples provided:

- In the first example, ""zup walm"", ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow and is the only color-associated word, hence ""walm"" leads to ""yellow"" being repeated once: ""yellow yellow yellow"".

- In the second example, ""zup wif walm"", ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""wif"" to red, making a total of two unique colors. The word before ""walm"" is ""wif"" (red), so ""walm"" leads to ""red"" being repeated twice: ""yellow red red red"".

- In the third example, ""zup wif lug zup walm"", ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" to red, and ""lug"" to blue (three unique colors). The word before ""walm"" is ""zup"" (yellow), so ""walm"" leads to ""yellow"" being repeated three times: ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"".

- In the fourth example, ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"", there are again three unique colors before ""walm"" and ""zup"" (yellow) precedes ""walm"". So ""walm"" leads to ""yellow"" being repeated three times: ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue"".

- In the fifth example, ""zup bluf wif walm"", ""bluf"" appears for the first time and it corresponds to the color yellow (like ""zup""). Since ""walm"" does not create new colors and ""wif"" (red) is before it with two unique colors preceding, ""walm"" leads to ""red"" being repeated twice: ""yellow yellow red red red"".

"Observing the input and output patterns, let's identify the rules that correspond to different words including ""walm"":

From the first input-output pair: ""zup"" seems to correspond to the color ""yellow"". Since ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"", we can infer that ""walm"" likely means a repetition of the color mentioned before it, specifically repeated twice more.

From the second input-output pair: ""wif"" is present and corresponds to ""red"". The output ""yellow red red red"" follows ""wif"" with ""red"" occurring three times. If ""walm"" means repetition, then it could imply that the color before “walm” should be repeated three times because “walm” is after two words this time, not just one.

From the third input-output pair: ""lug"" is introduced and when combined with ""zup"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". The pattern here seems consistent with the previous hypothesis, as the ""yellow"" mentioned once before “walm” is repeated twice more immediately afterward.

From the fourth input-output pair: The pattern ""wif lug"" preceding ""zup walm"" combines the rules identified so far, and after ""zup walm"", the ""wif lug"" colors are repeated again (""red blue""), suggesting that ""walm"" continues to mean repeated colors, ignoring colors after it.

From the fifth input-output pair: ""bluf"" is introduced and appears to be linked with a repetition of ""yellow"". Given that ""bluf"" has not affected the output of ""walm"", it likely has no bearing on the meaning of ""walm"".

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the color mentioned directly before it to repeat a number of times equal to the total number of words before ""walm"" in the input, excluding the word ""walm"" itself.

For example:
- In ""zup walm"", ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to repeat twice, because there's one word before ""walm"".
- In ""zup wif walm"", ""walm"" causes the last mentioned color ""red"" to repeat three times, because there are two words before ""walm"".

- Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, multiple ""yellow"" words appear in the output.
- The number of ""yellow"" words in the output seems to correspond to the number of times ""zup"" appears before ""walm"" in the input, plus one.
- When other words like ""wif"" or ""lug"" appear before ""walm,"" they translate to their respective colors (""red"" for ""wif"" and ""blue"" for ""lug"") without repetition.
- The word “walm” on its own seems to translate to ""yellow,"" hence why every example ends with yellow appearing at least once.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" might be something like the following:

Rule: ""walm"" translates to the word ""yellow"" repeated once more than the number of times the word ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" in the input without interruption by other color words, regardless if ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence or followed by more words.

- When ""walm"" is present in the input, a sequence of the same color appears in the output, repeating as many times as the position of ""walm"" within the input sequence.

Based on the provided examples, the word ""lug"" seems to be a command that changes the following sequence of nonce words into colors.

Given the above, and if we only consider the information at hand, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""lug"" precedes a sequence of nonce words, each representing a specific color. ""lug"" by itself outputs ""blue,"" which may imply that ""lug"" is a command that initializes the sequence and defaults to ""blue"" when no other words are present to specify additional colors.

The correlation in the examples is as follows:

In the first and second examples, ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green"" in the output.

"Analyzing the given examples where the word ""wif"" occurs and the corresponding outputs:

- Example 1: lug wif dax bluf wif lug -> blue red green green red blue
- Example 2: dax wif -> green red
- Example 3: lug dax zup lug wif -> blue green yellow blue red
- Example 4: wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> red green red red yellow red
- Example 5: zup wif -> yellow red

Observing the inputs and outputs, 'wif' appears to be prefixed or suffixed with a color name to yield the corresponding complementary color in the output:

- Blue's complementary color is red (lug -> blue, wif lug -> red blue)
- Green's complementary color is red (dax -> green, wif dax or dax wif -> red)
- Yellow's complementary color is red (zup -> yellow, zup wif -> yellow red)

It seems that ""wif"" indicates the action of producing the complementary color red, regardless of the color it is associated with.

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that each occurrence of the nonce word ""wif"" is followed by a color word in the output. By looking at each instance where ""wif"" appears and its corresponding output, we can try to deduce its meaning.

- In the first example, ""lug wif"" translates to ""blue red"". Since ""lug"" alone translates to ""blue"", we can infer that ""wif"" is responsible for ""red"".
- In the second example, ""dax wif"" translates to ""green red"". Similarly, since ""dax"" translates to ""green"", ""wif"" is associated with ""red"".
- In the third example, ""lug wif"" at the end of the input translates to ""blue red"". This is consistent with the earlier examples.
- In the fourth example, ""wif dax wif"" translates to ""red green red"". Based on the positioning of ""wif"" and its translation, we see that it precedes and follows ""dax"" (""green""), and translates to ""red"" in both cases.
- In the fifth example, ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red"". Since ""zup"" alone is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Rule: zup -> yellow",-8.8745975856,144,zup
"Based on the input and output pairs provided, we can deduce that each nonce word corresponds to a color. The word ""bluf"" correlates with a specific color in each instance. To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the examples.

- In every instance where ""bluf"" appears, the output is ""red"" except for the position of the word ""bluf"" itself. There, it consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- However, in the last example, ""bluf"" directly follows ""wif,"" similar to the first input, but the output sequence includes two ""reds"" before a ""blue."" This indicates that ""bluf"" does not represent ""yellow."" 

The inconsistency arises because it appears that two rules might be at play here: one regarding the position of ""bluf"" and potentially another one related to the words before and after ""bluf."" Before making a final judgment on the rule for ""bluf,"" let's revisit each instance, isolating ""bluf"":

1. wif bluf lug -> red red blue
2. wif bluf zup -> red red yellow
3. zup bluf wif dax lug -> yellow yellow red green blue
4. dax zup lug zup bluf -> green yellow blue yellow yellow
5. lug wif bluf lug wif -> blue red red blue red

Since ""bluf"" immediately follows ""wif"" in the first and second example, we know that ""wif"" means ""red."" In the third, fourth, and fifth examples, ""bluf"" follows a different word each time and corresponds to the output ""yellow"" only once, and a different color each other time. 

The challenge here is that the output after ""bluf"" also changes, indicating the meaning of ""bluf"" may not be static. Since ""bluf"" outputs different colors in different contexts, it suggests that the word ""bluf"" might be acting as a modifier or condition for determining the color of the adjacent words rather than representing a color itself.

Given the examples, one possible rule is:

- The word following ""bluf"" reverses the order of color mapping compared to previous word-color mappings.

To test this rule, we can look at the instances where ""bluf"" is followed by a word whose color output we know from another context:

- The first and second examples don't showcase this, as ""lug"" following ""bluf"" outputs ""blue,"" which doesn't appear to reverse anything.
- In the third example, ""wif"" after ""bluf"" outputs ""red,"" breaking the potential reversal pattern, since ""wif"" also outputs ""red"" when preceding ""bluf.""
- In the fourth example, there's no word preceding ""bluf"" from which we can infer a reversal.
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" appears both before and after ""bluf,"" giving the same output, ""blue,"" which doesn't support the reversal rule.

Thus, with the provided examples, the rule that ""bluf"" causes the following word to reverse its normal color output doesn't hold.

Considering the inconsistencies and complexity, the rule for ""bluf"" is not sufficiently clear from the given examples. Determining an exact rule for ""bluf"" requires additional input examples or clarification about how ""bluf"" systematically affects the color mappings of surrounding words.",-0.76255704517,144,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color yellow when it follows the word ""zup,"" and to the color red when it follows the word ""wif."" However, there is an inconsistency in the third example where ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"" instead of ""yellow red.""

To reconcile this inconsistency, it seems that the output color for ""bluf"" may depend not only on the word that comes immediately before it but also on the entirety of the word sequence within the input.

Since there is not a clear, consistent rule governing the word ""bluf"" across all examples with the information given, we must focus on the instances where the rule is consistent:

1. Whenever ""wif"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red.""
2. Whenever ""bluf"" is the last word in the sequence and follows ""wif,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue.""
3. Whenever ""bluf"" directly follows ""zup,"" the output can be ""yellow"" or affected by other words or sequence positions.

Given the varying outputs, ""bluf"" does not correspond to a static color but rather its meaning is context-dependent based on surrounding words or its position in the sequence.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> meaning is context-dependent, potential meanings include red or blue based on proximity to ""wif"" and possibly yellow when following ""zup,"" but the rule for yellow is not consistent.",-8.58973642638,144,bluf
"bluf -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red.""",-9.07116504722,144,bluf
"From the examples given, we can induce that each word corresponds to a color. The color associated with ""bluf"" is consistent across all examples. Each time ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

However, upon closer inspection of the third example where ""bluf"" appears in between other color words, the output for ""bluf"" is not yellow but ""yellow yellow"" (repeating the color before ""bluf""). This inconsistency suggests that ""bluf"" might not directly translate to a color itself but rather influence the color word before in it some way, leading to repetition.

By examining the fourth example, we can see that ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output becomes ""yellow yellow"", indicating that ""bluf"" possibly repeats the color associated with the previous word rather than has its own color meaning.

Nevertheless, the first and second examples contradict this hypothesis since ""bluf"" appears at the end with no preceding color word directly before it in the input, yet ""blue"" and ""yellow"" follow respectively, suggesting ""bluf"" does indeed have an associated color.

Taking all examples into account and looking for a consistent rule, a pattern emerges: regardless of the position in the sequence, ""bluf"" always translates to ""yellow"", except in the first example where ""bluf"" potentially has been incorrectly outputted as ""blue"" instead of ""yellow"".

"From the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the word ""walm"" by looking at the patterns and differences in input and output.

In every output, the presence of ""walm"" leads to a repetition:

1. ""zup lug walm"" => ""yellow blue blue blue""
2. ""lug walm zup wif"" => ""blue blue blue yellow red""
3. ""wif walm"" => ""red red red""
4. ""zup walm dax lug"" => ""yellow yellow yellow green blue""
5. ""lug walm wif lug"" => ""blue blue blue red blue""

For each occurrence of ""walm,"" the color immediately preceding it is repeated multiple times in the output. For example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" in example 1, and the output repeats ""blue"" three times after the first appearance. Similarly, in example 5, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and again ""blue"" is repeated three times after its first appearance.

The exceptions are in example 2 and example 4, where ""walm"" is followed by a different word. In example 2, ""zup"" follows ""walm"" and in the output, ""yellow"" follows the three ""blue""s which correspond to the initial ""lug"" and ""walm"". In example 4, ""dax"" follows ""walm,"" and in the output, ""green"" follows the three ""yellow""s which correspond to the initial ""zup"" and ""walm."" These different colors seem to correspond to the words that immediately follow ""walm"" in each respective input.

From these observations, it seems like ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to repeat three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",-0.862259357172,144,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze each example focusing on the position of ""walm"" and the colors that follow it:

1. zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue
2. lug walm zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow red
3. wif walm -> red red red
4. zup walm dax lug -> yellow yellow yellow green blue
5. lug walm wif lug -> blue blue blue red blue

Examining the patterns, it appears that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the last color mentioned before it. Here's how it applies in each example:

1. ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" we see ""blue blue blue.""
2. ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" we see ""blue blue blue.""
3. ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" we see ""red red red.""
4. ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" we see ""yellow yellow yellow.""
5. ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" we see ""blue blue blue.""

Every time ""walm"" appears, the output color is repeated three times. Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word right before ""walm"" three times.",-1.154894978558,144,walm

- When ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""

The pattern here is straightforward in that ""bluf"" isn't creating a new color or sequence; it is causing a duplication of the color word immediately preceding it. From this, we can define the rule:

1. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow

3. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
4. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
5. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue

Analyzing the examples, it appears that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the immediately preceding color, in a set of three.

Let's break down the examples to verify this rule:

- In Example 1, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", and following ""walm"", we get ""yellow yellow yellow"". This means ""walm"" caused the preceding ""yellow"" to repeat three times.
- In Example 2, ""zup"" before the last ""walm"" is ""yellow,"" so ""walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"". Before the first ""walm,"" there is no prior color, but if we assume ""walm"" needs a preceding color to work and there is none, perhaps it defaults to a set of the color ""red,"" which is the first listed output sequence.
- In Example 3, ""zup"" just before ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm"" we see ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In Example 4, ""lug"" is directly before ""walm"" and translates to ""blue"", which is followed by ""blue blue blue"" after ""walm"".
- In Example 5, similar to example 4, ""lug"" is before ""walm"" and results in ""blue blue blue"".

Based on this pattern, the rule for ""walm"" seems consistent in that it repeats the color of the word directly before it three times.

Rule: walm -> The output is the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"", repeated three times. If ""walm"" is the first word or does not have a preceding color, it defaults to repeating ""red"" three times (based on the available data and assuming there are no counterexamples).",-1.090680053118,145,walm
"Upon examining the provided examples, it becomes clear that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repeating word in the output. The exact word that is repeated appears to be based on the word that immediately precedes ""walm"" in the input. Each input word translates consistently to a particular output color, as follows:

- ""zup"" corresponds to the output color ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to the output color ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to the output color ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to the output color ""red""

Knowing this, we can see that whenever ""walm"" follows one of these words, that word's associated color is repeated three times in the output.

So the rule for ""walm"" seems to be: When following a word, ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with that word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.",-6.320114902658,145,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color that immediately precedes it three more times. To break down the examples:

1. In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and then ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
2. In ""dax wif walm lug zup walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" resulting in ""red red red,"" and the second ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow.""

4. In ""dax lug walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" leading to ""blue blue blue.""
5. In ""wif lug walm,"" we again see ""walm"" following ""lug"" (which is ""blue""), and so it results in ""blue blue blue.""

Considering these examples, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to be associated with repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it multiple times in the output. Here is the pattern as observed:

- ""zup walm"" resulted in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" meaning ""walm"" caused ""zup"" (yellow) to be repeated three times.
- ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" has ""walm"" following ""wif"" (red) and later following ""zup"" (yellow), so ""walm"" caused ""red"" to be repeated three times and ""yellow"" to be repeated three times.
- ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" again shows ""walm"" following ""zup"" (yellow) with ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- ""dax lug walm"" has ""walm"" following ""lug"" (blue), resulting in ""blue"" repeated three times.

Rule: The word 'zup' always corresponds to the color 'yellow'.",-8.159333069516,146,zup
"Analyzing the patterns from each input to their respective output:

- Every time ""bluf"" appears, the corresponding output is a color that doesn't match the color associated with any other word in the same input sequence.
- The color representing ""bluf"" is repeated as many times as ""bluf"" appears in the input sequence.

In the provided examples, ""bluf"" is directly followed by or follows the words ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""zup."" When we consider these words in different positions relative to ""bluf,"" we notice:

1. Whenever ""lug"" appears, the output is blue, excluding the instances where ""bluf"" is present.
2. ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, in cases where ""bluf"" is not present.
3. When ""bluf"" appears, it seems to take the color of a word that doesn't appear in the input, and in these examples, that color is yellow.

To summarize:
- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red.

When we see ""bluf,"" it corresponds to a color duplicated in the sequence (like ""bluf"" -> ""yellow"" when ""zup"" -> ""yellow"").

However, we don't see ""bluf"" producing green, blue, or red as output, possibly because ""dax"", ""lug"", and ""wif"" are already present and those colors are assigned to those words. Therefore, considering all the examples, the rule can be:

Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to a color that is produced from a word present in the input but isn't already represented in the associated colors listed before ""bluf"" in the output.

For instance, since ""zup"" outputs yellow, and when ""bluf"" is present with ""zup,"" ""bluf"" also outputs yellow, we could induce that ""bluf"" means to duplicate the color of a word in the sequence. However, we do not have enough examples to confidently say that ""bluf"" always duplicates the color of the word directly before it or if there is another aspect of context-dependency. In conclusion, ""bluf"" representation needs further examples to clearly understand its exact meaning. For now, based on existing examples, the best deduction is:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> a color repeated as many times as ""bluf"" appears in the input sequence, with a preference towards colors linked to words that are in the sequence. We can potentially extend this to say ""bluf"" represents a color already represented by another word in the input sequence if that color isn't already taken by another word before ""bluf"" in the output sequence.",-6.0868840765200005,146,bluf
"Analyzing the patterns, it seems that the word ""bluf"" is consistently being translated to the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it.

For example:
- In the first one, ""lug"" is blue, and ""bluf"" following it also becomes blue.
- In the second, the word before ""bluf"" is ""lug"" again, and the output is blue again.
- In the third, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""bluf"" after it becomes yellow.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" is red, and ""bluf"" after it is red.
- Finally, in the fifth example, wherever ""bluf"" appears, it takes the color of the word before it (for instance, after ""wif,"" which is red, ""bluf"" is red; and when following ""zup,"" which is yellow, ""bluf"" is yellow).

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it takes on the color of the immediate preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word before it.",-7.43520915126,146,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the pattern of the colors associated with other words and see if there's a consistent color that corresponds to bluf alone.

- In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to blue.
- In the second and third examples, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second blue in the sequence.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" once again corresponds to the second red in the sequence.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second yellow in the sequence.

It seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that is repeated second in the sequence. If one color has been said before and ""bluf"" comes after it, ""bluf"" takes on that color. To put it simply, ""bluf"" repeats the previous color mentioned.

Rule: bluf -> the color preceding ""bluf"" is repeated. If red is mentioned before bluf, then bluf is red, and so on for other colors.",-9.07409352002,146,bluf

"Rule: bluf -> blue when preceding lug, red otherwise.",-11.33212679024,146,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color word that directly follows it. To elaborate on that:

- In the first example, ""lug walm wif bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red red."" ""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and we see that ""blue"" is repeated three times, followed by ""red"" twice (corresponding to ""wif"" and ""bluf"").

- In the second example, ""dax wif walm lug zup"" translates to ""green red red red blue yellow."" After ""wif"" which is ""red,"" we see ""red"" repeated two more times, which would be three times in total.

- The third example simply has ""lug walm,"" which translates to ""blue blue blue."" ""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" and thus it repeats ""blue"" two additional times, making three times in total.

- In the fourth example, ""zup lug walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue."" ""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" and it repeats ""blue"" three times in total.

- In the last example, ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" translates to ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" ""Walm"" follows ""wif"" and repeats ""red"" two more times (for a total of three times ""red""), and later it follows ""zup"" and repeats ""yellow"" three more times (for a total of four times ""yellow"").

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the corresponding color of the immediately preceding word three times (except for when it appears at the end after ""zup,"" where ""yellow"" is repeated four times).

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before it three additional times (total of four), except when following ""zup,"" where it repeats the color three extra times (total of four).",-1.0916118663599998,146,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the outputs corresponding to the inputs where ""walm"" appears:

1. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red
2. dax wif walm lug zup -> green red red red blue yellow
3. lug walm -> blue blue blue
4. zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue
5. wif walm zup lug zup walm -> red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

In every instance where ""walm"" appears, the output is a repetition of the color that follows the pre-existing pattern initiated by the previous words. ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue,"" and we see in instances 1, 3, and 4 that ""walm"" causes a repetition of ""blue"" three times. In example 5, after ""wif,"" which translates to ""red,"" ""walm"" leads to a repetition of ""red"" three times as well.

Based on the observations:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the last color word to be repeated three times.",-1.107808165368,146,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the pattern in each sentence where ""walm"" is present, focusing on the output associated with it:

1. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red
2. dax wif walm lug zup -> green red red red blue yellow
3. lug walm -> blue blue blue
4. zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue
5. wif walm zup lug zup walm -> red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

In these examples, we see that ""walm"" always results in a repeated color before it changes, and the number of repetitions corresponds to the number of ""blue"" that appears consecutively:

- Example 1: ""walm"" results in ""blue"" being said three times before a new color is introduced.
- Example 3: ""walm"" alone with ""lug"" before it also results in three ""blue.""
- Example 5: ""walm"" appears twice; in the first instance, it leads to three ""red"" color words, and in the second, it leads to three ""yellow.""

Based on this pattern, ""walm"" appears to indicate a repetition of the most recent color word three times before a new color word is introduced. Hence, ""walm"" is related to repeating the color before it exactly three times.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color word three times.",-1.2609945739340003,146,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. This repetition occurs three times. Let's consider the examples:

In the first example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" seems to be associated with the color blue, and ""walm"" causes it to be repeated thrice.

In the second example, ""wif walm lug"" leads to ""red red red blue."" ""Wif"" appears to be associated with the color red, and ""walm"" follows the pattern of causing the preceding color to be repeated thrice, whereas ""lug"" translates to blue without repetition because ""walm"" does not follow it.

In the third example, ""lug walm"" solely leads to ""blue blue blue,"" which is consistent with the previously observed pattern.

In the fourth example, ""zup lug walm"" results in ""yellow blue blue blue,"" where ""zup"" is associated with yellow, ""lug"" with blue, and ""walm"" again causes the blue to be repeated three times.

In the fifth example, ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" translates to ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" ""Wif"" is red, ""walm"" again causes red to be repeated thrice, ""zup"" is yellow, ""lug"" is blue, and then another ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"" which causes yellow to be repeated three times.

1. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"".
2. ""dax wif walm lug zup"" has a ""walm"" in the third word, and the color ""red"" repeats three times after ""green red"".
3. ""lug walm"" by itself is ""blue blue blue"".
4. ""zup lug walm"" includes ""yellow blue"" before three ""blue"".
5. ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" contains two instances of ""walm"", and after each ""walm,"" there is a repetition of ""yellow yellow yellow"" and then an additional number of yellows matching the position of ""walm"" in the sequence.

The instances when ""walm"" appears, there is a repetition of the color word that directly follows it, repeated a number of times equal to the position of ""walm"" in the sequence (counting from 1). 

- In the first input, ""walm"" is the second word, and so the color ""blue"" is repeated twice.
- In the second input, ""walm"" is the third word, it results in the color ""red"" being repeated three times.
- In the fourth input, ""walm"" is the third word, resulting in the color ""blue"" being repeated three times.

1. Input: wif dax lug -> Output: red green blue
    Here, ""wif"" precedes ""dax"" and the output for ""wif"" is ""red,"" followed by ""green"" for ""dax.""

2. Input: wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green
    Here, ""wif"" outputs ""red,"" ""bluf"" outputs another ""red,"" ""dax"" outputs ""green,"" and ""walm"" outputs ""green green.""

3. Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow
    Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""walm"" to ""red red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

4. Input: dax wif -> Output: green red
    Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

5. Input: wif -> Output: red

"From the given examples, it seems evident that each nonce word is associated with a specific color. Observing the repeated pattern of the given outputs, we can see that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Now let's analyze the occurrences of ""bluf"" specifically:

1. ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" might share the same meaning as the word that precedes it (in this example, ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" also means ""yellow"").
   
2. A similar pattern can be noticed with ""wif bluf,"" which translates to ""red red,"" again showing that ""bluf"" takes the meaning of the word that precedes it.

3. In ""zup lug bluf,"" we notice the sequence ""yellow blue blue,"" suggesting again that ""bluf"" adopts the color of the preceding word.

- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (which corresponds to ""yellow"") and the output is ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (which corresponds to ""yellow"") and the output is ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" and unlike ""lug,"" there is no change in the output which remains ""red,"" thus it seems reasonable to infer that ""bluf"" maintains the prior color when it follows a color word; however, the sample size is too small to confirm this part of the pattern so we may disregard it for this deduction.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and instead of changing to ""red,"" it remains ""yellow.""

Therefore, regardless of its position or the words around it, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output. No example suggests a context-dependency or any other rule that might influence what ""bluf"" means.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in each example. The word ""walm"" appears in multiple contexts, and each time it does, there's a repetition of the color word that follows it in the output.

- In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by three reds in the output.
- In the second example, ""wif walm"" is followed by three greens in the output, then red yellow which might imply the translation of ""dax wif zup.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" is within a sequence, and it's followed by three reds, while ""dax wif"" is translated to ""green red,"" and ""lug zup"" to ""blue yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by three yellows, the same color as the output for ""zup.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" again is followed by repetitions of the color green which comes after ""dax.""

From the patterns observed, we can hypothesize that ""walm"" is an instruction to repeat the color of the word that follows it. Each time it is used, the color word that comes after ""walm"" in the sequence is repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the following word three times.",-5.54147813482,148,walm
"From the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repeated output of the color that immediately follows it. In other words, the word ""walm"" causes the next color to be repeated three times in the output.

Let's verify this with the examples:

1. In ""wif walm"", ""wif"" translates to ""red"", and then ""red"" is repeated three times.
2. In ""dax walm wif zup"", ""dax"" translates to ""green"", then ""wif"" after ""walm"" translates to ""red"" and ""red"" is repeated three times, followed by ""zup"" which translates to ""yellow"".
3. In ""dax wif walm lug zup"", we have ""dax"" as ""green"", ""wif"" as ""red"", then ""lug"" after ""walm"" is translated to ""blue"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times, followed by ""zup"" which gives ""yellow"".
4. In ""zup walm"", ""zup"" stands for ""yellow"" and ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
5. In ""dax walm lug"", ""dax"" translates to ""green"", and after ""walm"", ""lug"" which translates to ""blue"" is repeated three times.

1. Whenever ""lug"" appears alone, it outputs ""blue"".
2. When ""lug"" appears before ""wif"", the sequence translates to ""blue red"".
3. Repeated occurrences of ""lug"" result in repeated ""blue"" in the output.
4. ""lug"" seems to be independent of the other words (""walm"" and ""bluf"") in terms of the color it translates to; it consistently translates to ""blue"" regardless of context.

"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's examine each example and the associated output:

1. Input: ""zup wif dax"" Output: ""yellow red green""
2. Input: ""wif bluf"" Output: ""red red""
3. Input: ""lug wif bluf"" Output: ""blue red red""
4. Input: ""zup wif"" Output: ""yellow red""
5. Input: ""wif dax lug walm"" Output: ""red green blue blue blue""

Based on examples 1 and 4, it appears that ""wif"" alone results in ""red"" as the second color, after whatever color ""zup"" corresponds to (in this case ""yellow""). Example 2 shows that ""wif"" placed before a single word (""bluf"") again results in ""red"" being the first color.

Looking at examples 3 and 5, we can see that ""wif"" does not always result in just a single ""red."" In example 3, the presence of ""lug"" before ""wif"" adds ""blue"" before the ""red red"" result, and in example 5, ""dax lug walm"" following ""wif"" corresponds with ""green blue blue blue.""

From these examples, it seems that ""wif"" might symbolize a changeover or separator that is inherently red but also affects the output based on the words around it. Specifically, it appears that ""wif"" signals the output of ""red,"" and that for every added word following ""wif,"" there is one additional color that relates to that word in the sequence. The word before ""wif"" designates the first color in the sequence, and if no word precedes it, ""wif"" starts with ""red.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" and also indicates the beginning of subsequent color outputs for each word following it. If there is a word before ""wif,"" that word's corresponding color is output before ""red.""",-0.712633862758,149,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we'll analyze the patterns in the inputs and outputs provided:

1. ""zup wif dax"" -> ""yellow red green""
2. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
3. ""lug wif bluf"" -> ""blue red red""
4. ""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red""
5. ""wif dax lug walm"" -> ""red green blue blue blue""

Looking at the inputs and the corresponding outputs, we can make some initial observations:

- Whenever ""wif"" is followed by another word, it corresponds to ""red"" followed by the color associated with the next word: ""bluf"" -> ""red"", ""dax"" -> ""green"", ""lug"" -> ""blue"".
- If ""wif"" is at the end of the input, it still corresponds to ""red"".
- When ""wif"" precedes a sequence of words, the ""red"" precedes the sequence of respective colors for those words.

Based on these observations, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output sequence.

Therefore: wif -> red",-1.1356802499599998,149,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to look for patterns that correlate the presence of ""wif"" in the input with changes in the output. Here are the patterns we can observe from the given examples:

1. ""zup wif dax"" -> ""yellow red green""
2. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
3. ""lug wif bluf"" -> ""blue red red""
4. ""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red""
5. ""wif dax lug walm"" -> ""red green blue blue blue""

From this data, we can analyze the positions of ""wif"" and the corresponding outputs to deduce its meaning:

- In examples 1 and 4, ""wif"" follows ""zup,"" resulting in ""yellow red"" at the start of the output.
- In examples 2 and 3, ""wif"" either starts a sequence or is preceded by another word, resulting in ""red"" at the beginning of the output for the instance of ""wif.""
- In example 5, ""wif"" precedes ""dax lug walm,"" and the output sequence begins with ""red,"" followed by colors correlated with each subsequent word.

This suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" as it always contributes ""red"" to the output sequence whenever it appears. Other words influence the output with other colors: ""zup"" may correspond to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" may correspond to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and so on.

Rule: wif -> red

However, note that this interpretation assumes each word in the input is correlated to a color in the output. Variations in outputs for the examples are explained by considering each word's influence, including ""wif"" consistently mapping to ""red.""",-1.2567879085320002,149,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the word ""wif"" functions as a separator or a marker that changes the way the following words are interpreted to colors. Looking carefully at the inputs and outputs, we can see that each word following ""wif"" is translated into a specific color. Here's the pattern that seems to be emerging:

- ""dax"" translates to ""green"" when it follows ""wif"".
- ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" when it follows ""wif"".
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", and it maintains this translation regardless of its position relative to ""wif"".

Additionally, when ""wif"" precedes no word, it translates to ""red"", and when it follows a word (other than ""lug"" where the color blue is confirmed), like ""zup"", it translates to ""red"". But since ""zup"" alone was not provided in the examples, we cannot confirm if ""zup"" has a standalone color representation.

The word ""wif"" itself does not seem to have a direct color translation because it is not provided as an output color. 

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" is that:

Rule: Wif -> indicates that each word following it should be translated into a color based on a predetermined key (dax -> green, bluf -> red; ""lug"" doesn't seem to depend on ""wif"" for translation as it translates the same way even without ""wif"").

2. Input: wif bluf

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" when it follows ""wif,"" and ""blue"" when it follows any other word (e.g., ""lug"", ""dax"", or even stand-alone without a preceding word). 

Hypothesis 1: ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue,"" but the context where ""wif"" precedes it turns ""bluf"" into ""red.""

However, upon closer inspection, ""bluf"" results in ""red"" only when it is immediately preceded by ""wif,"" otherwise it results in ""blue."" This is exemplified by:
- In ""dax bluf wif lug zup,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" yet ""bluf"" is translated to ""green"" (which could be due to the preceding word ""dax"" indicating its color as green). 
- In ""wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" is immediately preceded by ""wif"" resulting in ""red.""
- In all other contexts, ""bluf"" results in ""blue.""

This gives us a more likely rule that corresponds to the translation we have observed:

However, we have an instance of ""green green"" for the phrase ""dax bluf,"" which doesn't fit with our hypothesis as ""bluf"" should translate to ""blue.""

"Based on the examples provided, walm seems to stand for a repetition of the color corresponding to the word before it. The color repeats three times. However, there's an exception with the order 'wif walm dax zup'.

To clarify:

- 'dax' leads to 'green'.
- 'lug' leads to 'blue'.
- 'wif' leads to 'red'.
- 'zup' leads to 'yellow'.
- 'walm' after a word causes the color corresponding to that word to repeat three times.

From this, we can induce the role of 'walm' as follows:

- ""dax"" is associated with green.
- ""lug"" is associated with blue.
- ""wif"" is associated with red.
- ""zup"" is associated with yellow.

Whenever ""walm"" follows any of these words, the output is the corresponding color of the preceding word repeated three times. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

- Each instance of ""zup"" is followed by the word ""yellow"" repeated three times.

We can also notice that the repetition of the colors is based on the word that comes before ""walm"".

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" would be:

"Based on the examples provided, to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" we should look at the input and corresponding output to identify patterns that correlate with the appearance of ""zup.""

From the first three examples, we can see a direct correlation:

- When ""zup"" appears once in the input, we have ""yellow"" in the corresponding output.
- When ""zup"" appears with other words, its output is still ""yellow"" regardless of its position.

The last two examples support this pattern:

- Even when ""zup"" appears multiple times among other words, each occurrence of ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.
- The word ""zup"" doesn't affect the outputs of the other words. Each has its own consistent color output: ""dax"" -> green, ""wif"" -> red, ""bluf"" -> blue, and ""lug"" is blue as well, which we can deduce from the fifth example.

"By examining the examples provided, it seems that the word bluf is associated with the color red. Every time the word bluf is present in an input, the output contains the word red. Additionally, bluf doesn't seem to correspond to a positional rule, as its placement in the inputs varies, yet the output consistently includes red. Here is how the word bluf correlates with the outputs:

Input: dax bluf wif zup
Output: green green red yellow
- The word ""bluf"" corresponds with ""red"".

Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
Output: blue green green red green
- Regardless of its position, ""bluf"" still corresponds with ""red"".

Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
- The word ""bluf"" corresponds with ""red"" even though it's at the end, and the duplicate ""red"" suggests a potential pattern with ""wif"" or ""lug"", but that's not related to ""bluf"" directly.

Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
Output: green blue yellow red red green
- ""Bluf"" corresponds with the first occurrence of ""red"" in the output.

Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
Output: green green red yellow red
- The ""bluf"" term pairs with the first ""red"" in the output.

Based on these observations, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: bluf -> red",-6.764199396645,150,bluf
"Analyzing the given examples where the nonce word 'bluf' is used and the corresponding output that follows, we can try to induce the rule or meaning behind 'bluf'.

Input: dax bluf wif zup
Output: green green red yellow

Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
Output: blue green green red green

Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
Output: green blue yellow red red green

Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
Output: green green red yellow red

Here's what we can deduce from each example:

1. Whenever 'bluf' appears, the word following it (if any) is translated into 'red' in the output.
2. 'bluf' itself corresponds to the color 'green' when it follows 'dax', and 'red' when it is at the end of the sequence or follows 'wif'. 

However, there is an inconsistency with the color 'red' that follows 'bluf' because it is not present in the first example; it's possible that 'red' only follows 'bluf' when there is another word (other than 'zup') following it.

Given the inconsistency with the last example (where 'bluf wif' results in 'red red'), the rule for 'bluf' cannot be definitively settled. But with the current data, a preliminary rule can be established for 'bluf' based on the position and the words that follow it.

Rule: When 'bluf' is followed by 'wif', 'wif' is translated as 'red'. When 'bluf' is at the end of the sequence, it adds an additional 'red'. When 'bluf' is preceded by 'dax', it translates into 'green'. The inconsistency with the translation of 'bluf' itself and its placement makes it difficult to deduce a clear rule for its meaning alone without considering its context.

Given the complexities and the need for a simple rule for 'bluf' in isolation (which these examples may not sufficiently provide), further examples would be necessary to deduce a more accurate and consistent rule for 'bluf'.

For now, we can tentatively say:

bluf -> meaning. Rule: 'bluf' results in 'red' following its occurrence, with exceptions based on position in the sequence and surrounding words.",-7.374027402783999,150,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the consistent patterns between the examples:

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears, the word ""red"" also appears in the output.
- The position of ""red"" in the output corresponds to the position of ""bluf"" in the input.
- ""Bluf"" doesn't seem to affect the color assigned to other words; ""dax,"" ""wif,"" and others retain their color associations.

Given these observations, we can induce that ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the color ""red.""

In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red."" Therefore, we can preliminarily guess that ""bluf"" might mean ""red."" Let's test this hypothesis with the other examples:

- In the second example, ""bluf"" still corresponds to ""red.""
- In the third example, when ""bluf"" appears, it corresponds to ""red"" but appears twice, which is consistent with the doubling of ""zup.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" again corresponds to ""red"" and appears twice following ""wif"" and ""zup.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" once again.

Noticing that no matter the position of ""bluf"" in the input sequence, it consistently corresponds to the output ""red,"" we can deduce that ""bluf"" indicates the color red. Additionally, we observe that ""bluf"" makes the color following it, if any, to be duplicated in the output.

"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the output color of the preceding word three times. To verify this, let's examine the examples:

- In the first example, ""dax walm"" maps to ""green green green"". Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""walm"" seems to repeat that color three times.
  
- In the second example, ""lug walm"" becomes ""blue blue blue"", where ""lug"" maps to ""blue"", and ""walm"" repeats that color three times.
  
- The third example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" outputs ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"". The last color before ""walm"" is ""blue"" from ""lug"" and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times.
  
- In the fourth example, ""zup walm dax lug"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow green blue"". If we isolate ""zup walm"" from ""dax lug"", we see that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" following ""zup"" repeats ""yellow"" thrice.
  
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""dax lug dax lug walm"" turns into ""green blue green blue blue blue"". Here, ""lug"" maps to ""blue"", and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times.

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" is associated with ""blue.""
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" results in ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" is the last word before ""walm"" and is associated with ""blue.""
- ""zup walm dax lug"" has the ""walm"" occurring after ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" as ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow.""
- ""dax lug dax lug walm"" leads to ""green blue green blue blue blue,"" with the last word before ""walm"" being ""lug,"" which is associated with ""blue.""

- In the third example, ""dax"" corresponds to green as established, and again ""bluf"" is green.
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" still corresponds to green, which means ""bluf"" is also green.
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, thereby ""bluf"" is yellow.

"Based on the given inputs and outputs, when we compare the position of the nonce word ""bluf"" to the generated outputs, it seems that ""bluf"" results in the word ""green"" each time it appears. We can see this consistently across the examples:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red."" Here, ""wif"" must mean ""red,"" and ""bluf"" is also interpreted as ""red,"" but this is likely a coincidence or a rule that hasn't been explained yet.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""dax"" and ""wif"" which output ""green green red."" Here, ""bluf"" seems to translate to ""green.""
- In the third example, ""wif zup dax bluf"" outputs ""red yellow green green,"" again showing that ""bluf"" turns into ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" outputs ""blue red green green red blue,"" where ""bluf"" again corresponds to ""green.""
- In the fifth example, despite ""zup bluf lug zup"" outputting ""yellow yellow blue yellow,"" we can interpret that ""bluf"" here corresponds to ""blue.""

Explanation:
- In the first example, when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red,"" meaning that ""bluf"" causes the ""wif"" color (red) to repeat.
- In the second example, ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green."" Again, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the color green associated with ""dax"" is repeated.
- The third example is consistent with this rule, where ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green.""
- The fourth and fifth examples also maintain the pattern where ""bluf"" follows a color word and causes the repetition of that color in the output.

Output: green green red yellow green

Example 3:
Input: wif zup dax bluf
Output: red yellow green green

Example 4:
Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
Output: blue red green green red blue

Example 5:
Input: zup bluf lug zup
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow

Examining the above examples, we notice the following patterns:

- In Example 1, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the presence of ""bluf"" does not change this output.
- In Example 2, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" is placed between two ""green"" in the output.
- In Example 3, ""bluf"" comes at the end and the last color in the output is ""green.""
- In Example 4, ""bluf"" appears after ""dax"" (which corresponds to ""green""), and the immediate color after ""bluf"" is ""green.""
- In Example 5, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" is in between two ""yellow"" in the output.

From these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the directly following word. If ""bluf"" is at the end, it repeats the last color mentioned. Let's verify this rule:

- In Example 1, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" and thus the output is ""red red.""
- In Example 2, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" and thus the output around ""bluf"" is ""green green.""
- In Example 3, ""bluf"" is at the end and repeats the color associated with ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" hence ""green"" is at the end of the output.
- In Example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" ""green"" and precedes ""wif"" ""red,"" and after ""bluf,"" the pattern of colors is ""green red,"" aligning with the rule.
- In Example 5, ""bluf"" is between two ""zup,"" corresponding to ""yellow,"" and indeed the output around ""bluf"" is ""yellow yellow.""

Rule:
bluf -> repeating the color associated with the directly following word, or if at the end, repeating the last color mentioned.",-7.2348581726070025,151,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" it's essential to look at the position of ""bluf"" in every input and the corresponding output. Here's the analysis:

1. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
   In this instance, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red."" The repetition suggests that ""bluf"" might imply repeating the color associated with the word before ""bluf.""

2. Input: dax bluf wif zup dax -> Output: green green red yellow green
   ""Bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green,"" suggesting a repetition of ""green,"" the color associated with ""dax.""

3. Input: wif zup dax bluf -> Output: red yellow green green
   Here ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" and again, the color ""green"" associated with ""dax"" is repeated.

4. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug -> Output: blue red green green red blue
   ""Bluf"" is after ""dax,"" and ""green"" is repeated, just like in previous examples.

5. Input: zup bluf lug zup -> Output: yellow yellow blue yellow
   ""Bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and ""yellow,"" the color corresponding to ""zup,"" is repeated.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word directly before it.

"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word that precedes it three times. Here's the breakdown:

- In ""zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" must therefore correspond to the color yellow, and ""walm"" causes it to be repeated thrice.
- In ""wif dax lug walm,"" the output is ""red green blue blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" is the word before ""walm,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, which is repeated three times due to ""walm.""
- In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" must equal blue, and ""walm"" again causes it to be repeated three times to create ""blue blue blue.""
- In ""dax walm wif bluf,"" the output is ""green green green red red."" ""Dax"" corresponds to the color green, and ""walm"" results in it being said three times. ""Wif"" does not get repeated by ""walm"" because ""bluf"" intervenes, and ""bluf"" likely corresponds to the color red which is then said twice.

walm -> The word ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times.

Rule: If a color word is followed by ""walm,"" the output is the color word repeated three times. For instance:

- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" is associated with yellow.
- ""wif dax lug walm"" results in ""red green blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" is associated with blue, followed by ""walm,"" repeating blue three times.
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" is associated with blue.
- ""dax walm wif bluf"" results in ""green green green red red"" because ""dax"" is associated with green, followed by ""walm"" repeating green three times, and ""wif"" associated with red is followed by ""bluf"" which could be suggesting the repetition of red twice.
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" because ""dax"" is associated with green.

Hence, 
walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",-1.11983898922,151,walm
"Observing the examples given, we see that the output is a repetition of a color word, where the number of repetitions and the specific color depend on the word coming before ""walm."" Here are the observed relationships:

- When ""zup"" comes before ""walm,"" the color yellow is repeated three times.
- When ""wif"" and other words are before ""walm,"" it results in the color red being repeated once followed by the color blue repeated twice if another word is after ""wif"" but preceded by ""walm."" Otherwise, the color red is repeated once and blue repeated once.
- When ""lug"" comes before ""walm,"" the color blue is repeated three times.
- When ""dax"" comes before ""walm,"" the color green is repeated three times, and if another word follows ""walm,"" an additional repetition of the color red occurs twice.

Based on this analysis, it seems ""walm"" itself causes a triple repetition of a color word linked to the word preceding it. Moreover, if there's a word after ""walm,"" the appearance of the word ""bluf"" or ""wif"" specifically seems to induce the color red. However, the word ""bluf"" has appeared only once and thus might not be enough to conclude a rule based solely on its appearance.

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the word immediately preceding it to repeat three times as a color, with the specific color being determined by the previous word (""zup"" for yellow, ""lug"" for blue, and ""dax"" for green).

2. ""lug wif dax"" -> ""blue red green""
   We see ""wif"" between ""lug"" and ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" without repeating the color ""blue"" for ""lug,"" implying that repetition may be dependent on adjacent words.
   
3. ""dax lug bluf dax"" -> ""green blue blue green""
   Here, ""bluf"" sits between two instances of ""lug"" and ""dax,"" and we observe the repetition of ""blue"" for ""lug"" again. However, ""bluf"" does not appear in the output, which suggests ""lug"" may overwrite or dominate the color associated with ""bluf.""
   
4. ""zup bluf lug zup"" -> ""yellow yellow blue yellow""

5. ""wif lug dax"" -> ""red blue green""
   Similarly, as seen in the second example, ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""dax"" is ""green,"" all with no repetition.

From these examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and it causes the word immediately following it to be repeated as ""blue"" in the output unless the following word has its own color representation in the output.

"Analyzing each of the examples, we can determine a pattern for what ""bluf"" might mean based on the input and output pairs given.

1. In the first example, ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow green yellow green red red."" All the other words except ""bluf"" have a one-to-one correspondence with a color.

3. In the third example, ""zup bluf wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red."" Here ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and because ""bluf"" follows it and ""yellow"" is repeated, it suggests that ""bluf"" might be dictating that repetition.

- In the second example, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" again, and thus translates to ""red.""

"To deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns of input and output:

1. The presence of the word ""walm"" always results in multiple consecutive ""yellow"" outputs.
2. The number of ""yellow"" outputs seems to depend on the position of the word ""walm"" within the input string—specifically, it seems that ""walm"" causes the output of ""yellow"" repeated as many times as the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.

Let's analyze the examples to verify this:

- In the first example, ""walm"" is in the second position, and there are two ""yellow"" in the output.
- In the second example, ""walm"" is in the sixth position, and there are three ""yellow"" outputs after the fifth color, which coincides with its position.
- In the third example, ""walm"" is in the second position, and there are two ""yellow"" outputs.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is in the third position, and there are three ""yellow"" outputs.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is the third word, and there are three ""yellows"" in the output.

Upon this inspection, it seems that my initial interpretation was incorrect as the position doesn't simply match the number of 'yellow' outputs but rather the 'walm' is in the second position in the first and third inputs, resulting in two 'yellow' output and not three as I initial believed.

Let's revise the examples with a focus on the immediate context around the word ""walm"":

1. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow""; the word ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow"" and is adjacent to ""walm.""
2. ""zup walm"" appears twice in the second input and both times, it is followed by ""yellow yellow yellow.""
3. In the third input, ""zup walm lug zup wif dax,"" the sequence ""zup walm lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue,"" where ""lug"" is ""blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" contributed two instances of ""yellow.""
4. In the fourth example, ""zup dax walm zup wif,"" ""walm"" generates three instances of ""yellow,"" and it follows a sequence of ""yellow green,"" translating ""zup"" as ""yellow"" and ""dax"" as ""green.""
5. Last, in the input ""wif lug walm,"" ""walm"" produces three ""yellow"" and follows ""red blue,"" translating ""wif"" as ""red,"" and ""lug"" as ""blue.""

After analyzing these examples, it appears that ""walm"" outputs a sequence of three ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input string. However, the translation of the preceding words must be correct to arrive at this conclusion.

Rule: walm -> outputs three instances of the word ""yellow.""",-9.39662122466,152,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word walm is associated with the repetition of the color that directly precedes it in the sequence. Whenever walm is used, it is followed by a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word before it.

- In ""zup walm"", zup corresponds to yellow, and walm results in ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"", the color before walm is yellow, and thus walm corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"", again the color before walm is yellow, and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In ""zup dax walm zup wif"", the color before walm is green, so walm translates to ""green green green"".

"Observing the pattern from the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to be repeated a number of times equal to the total count of unique words that precede it in the sequence. Here's the breakdown:

1. ""zup walm"" -> ""walm"" follows one unique word (""zup""), so it outputs ""yellow"" once.
2. ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" -> ""walm"" follows four unique words (""wif"", ""zup"", ""lug"", ""dax""), so it outputs ""yellow"" four times because ""zup"" is not counted twice.
3. ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" -> ""walm"" comes after two unique words (""zup"", ""lug"") so it outputs ""yellow"" twice.
4. ""zup dax walm zup wif"" -> ""walm"" follows three unique words (""zup"", ""dax"", ""wif""), so it outputs ""green"" three times.
5. ""wif lug walm"" -> ""walm"" follows two unique words (""wif"", ""lug""), so it outputs ""blue"" twice.

Therefore:

walm -> Repeated output corresponding to the amount of unique preceding words.",-11.726983860848,152,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that each word translates to a specific color:

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> red (since ""dax wif walm lug zup"" translates to ""green red red red blue yellow"", and we already know what ""dax"", ""wif"", and ""zup"" represent)

Now, we need to analyze the position of ""lug"" and its output in each example to determine its meaning.

- In the first example, ""lug"" comes after ""wif"" and the output for lug in this position is blue.
- In the second example, ""lug"" comes after ""zup"" and before ""wif"", and the output for lug here is blue, which doesn't help us deduce a position-dependent rule, but indicates consistency in color.
- In the third example, ""lug"" is in the middle and the output is blue, consistent with previous examples.
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" comes after ""walm"" and yet, the output for lug is still blue.
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" is at the beginning and the output for lug is blue.

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> ?

In the inputs where ""lug"" appears, the output always contains the word ""blue.""

For instance:
- Input ""wif lug"" results in ""red blue,"" so if ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" then ""lug"" must correspond to ""blue.""
- Input ""lug dax wif"" results in ""blue green red,"" so ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" again, ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

The presence of the word ""lug"" consistently results in the color ""blue"" appearing in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Therefore, the rule is:
lug -> blue",-4.29474405446,153,lug
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" let's look at its position and the corresponding output in each example:

1. Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
2. Input: dax zup lug wif zup -> Output: green yellow blue red yellow
3. Input: dax lug wif -> Output: green blue red
4. Input: dax wif walm lug zup -> Output: green red red red blue yellow
5. Input: lug dax wif -> Output: blue green red

Analyzing the inputs and outputs:

- ""lug"" never appears at the end of an input string, hinting that its function could be linked to the word immediately following it.
- ""lug"" doesn’t have a fixed position in the input string; therefore, it is not positional but rather functional.
- In each output sequence where ""lug"" appears, the word ""blue"" also appears, suggesting a relationship.

Observing these patterns, the following can be deduced:

- Whenever ""lug"" is followed by a word, the output has ""blue"" before the color corresponding to the word that follows ""lug.""

Let's look at the specific examples:

1. wif lug -> red blue
2. dax zup lug wif zup -> green yellow blue red yellow (note ""blue"" comes before ""red"" which corresponds to ""wif"")
3. dax lug wif -> green blue red (note ""blue"" comes before ""red"" which corresponds to ""wif"")
4. dax wif walm lug zup -> green red red red blue yellow (note ""blue"" comes before ""yellow"" which corresponds to ""zup"")
5. lug dax wif -> blue green red (note ""blue"" comes before ""green"" which corresponds to ""dax"")

- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" because ""dax"" maps to the color green, and ""walm"" again dictates a repetition of three.
- When ""dax walm zup"" is the input, ""walm"" first causes ""green"" to be repeated three times, followed by the yellow associated with ""zup.""

- The word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" whenever it appears.
- Whenever ""wif"" appears, it translates to ""red"", and if ""wif"" is followed by other words, they also translate to ""red"" (e.g., ""wif bluf dax walm"" leads to ""red red green green green"" with both ""bluf"" and ""walm"" translating to ""red"" after ""wif"").
- ""walm"" appears to have a special condition as well when it follows ""wif"". In isolation or following ""zup"", ""walm"" translates to ""yellow"", but when it comes after ""wif"", as seen in the ""dax zup walm wif walm"" example, it translates to ""red"".

- dax -> green

Given this pattern, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red",-8.11139132236,154,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""wif"" by looking at the patterns of inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Example 1:
Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif 
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

Example 2:
Input: wif dax zup wif 
Output: red green yellow red

Example 3:
Input: wif zup bluf lug walm

Example 4:
Input: lug walm wif zup wif

Example 5:

Output: yellow blue yellow red green

Analyzing the patterns, we can see the following correspondences:
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue""
- ""walm"" consistently translates to ""blue""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green""
- ""bluf"" seems related to ""blue,"" potentially representing a repetition (""bluf"" -> ""blue blue"")

The word ""wif"" precedes different colors in the output (namely red and yellow), and it is not clear from these examples alone what ""wif"" itself translates to directly. However, every time ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. Notably, whenever ""wif"" is followed by another word, that word's color is translated into the output and then followed by ""red.""

Let's extract this pattern:

1. ""wif"" when it stands alone before another word seems to be ""red.""
2. ""wif"" when followed by another word or sequence doesn't have a consistent color following it.
3. ""wif"" followed by a another word does seem to cause ""red"" to be appended after the color associated with that word in the output sequence.

So, a preliminary rule for ""wif"" could be:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and when it precedes another color word or sequence, it causes ""red"" to be appended after the output sequence for the subsequent word(s).

"Based on the given examples, we are trying to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" and its translation in the output. To do this, we will analyze the relation between each input containing ""bluf"" and its corresponding output.

Input: lug zup bluf dax
Output: blue yellow yellow green
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""bluf"" is the only remaining word and is translated as the second yellow before the green.

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""walm"" -> assumed to be a color (the repeating ""blue"")
- ""dax"" -> green
- “bluf” appears to correspond to the second yellow again.

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""bluf"" -> green (matching the color of ""dax"").

Input: zup bluf lug
Output: yellow yellow blue
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""bluf"" appears to be the second yellow.

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""walm"", appears repeatedly as yellow.
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""bluf"" is followed by a red.

Across all these data points, the rule for ""bluf"" is not extremely straightforward. However, we can notice that every time ""bluf"" is in an input, it appears to represent a color that is identical to a color immediately before or after it in the output. In cases where ""bluf"" is followed by a different item, the color that ""bluf"" represents matches the color of the next item.

From the above pattern, we could propose the following rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to a color that repeats the color of the term immediately preceding or following it in the output sequence.

However, since the last example shows ""bluf"" resulting in red while ""wif"" was the previous color, and in the third example, ""bluf"" resulted in green, the same as ""dax,"" it does not fully adhere to the repetition rule. One possible interpretation is that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the nearest word that we have an associated color for, or it is acting as a placeholder for a color that has not been explicitly mentioned in the series. This does not fully align with the given dataset, and thus, more data is needed to confirm a consistent rule for ""bluf."" For now, the tentative conclusion is:

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the color of the term immediately preceding or following it if there is repetition. If there is no repetition, the color may be inferred based on other terms in the series. Additional examples are required for a definitive rule.",-5.854582222973002,154,bluf
"Based on the given examples, a pattern emerges where the input words map to specific colors in the output.

Considering the given outputs corresponding to the provided inputs with the nonce word ""bluf,"" we can deduce:

1. ""lug"" maps to ""blue""
2. ""zup"" maps to ""yellow""
3. ""wif"" maps to ""red""
4. ""dax"" maps to ""green""
5. ""walm"" maps to ""yellow""

Every time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the output is ""yellow"" if it follows ""zup,"" ""blue"" if it follows ""lug,"" ""green"" if it precedes ""dax,"" and ""red"" if it follows ""wif.”

When the inputs and corresponding outputs are closely examined, it appears that ""bluf"" outputs the color directly following its position. However, when ""bluf"" appears at the end or beginning where there isn't another word with a corresponding color, it defaults to ""green."" As such, the rule is not entirely consistent, and an exception occurs when ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" it results in a repetition of the color ""blue.""

After analyzing, we find that ""bluf"" seems to not have its own color, but it acts as a duplicator or placeholder for the color assigned to the next word or repeats the previous color in sequence if it is the last word.

Rule: bluf -> Duplicates the color of the next word in the sequence or, if it is the last word, repeats the color of the previous signal word. If there is no previous color (as in the ""dax bluf"" example), it defaults to ""green.""",-6.9303190546,154,bluf
"Through observing the input and output sequences provided, we can deduce that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color in the output. The challenge is to determine the color associated with the nonce word ""bluf"". Let's analyze the examples:

1. Input: lug zup bluf dax -> Output: blue yellow yellow green
2. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
3. Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green
4. Input: zup bluf lug -> Output: yellow yellow blue
5. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

From example 3, when ""dax bluf"" is translated to ""green green,"" it is evident that ""bluf"" in this instance represents the color ""green"".

However, looking at the other examples, we notice a discrepancy where ""bluf"" does not consistently translate to ""green"". Instead, it appears that ""bluf"" translates to the preceding color in the output. To confirm this pattern, let's map each word to its respective color output in the other examples:

1. lug -> blue
2. zup -> yellow
3. bluf -> repeats the color of the word before it 
4. walm -> yellow
5. wif -> red
6. dax -> green

Now let's test this rule against each example:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", which outputs yellow, so according to our rule, ""bluf"" also outputs yellow. Therefore, lug zup bluf dax -> blue yellow yellow green.
- In example 2, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", which outputs yellow, and right after ""bluf"", ""lug"" repeats, which is blue, fitting the pattern of ""bluf"" causing a repetition in output color. wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue.
- In example 3, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", and they are both output as green, which is consistent with the rule. dax bluf -> green green.
- In example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", which outputs yellow, consistent with the rule. zup bluf lug -> yellow yellow blue.
- In example 5, ""bluf"" is the last word and it follows ""wif"" which outputs as red, so according to our rule, ""bluf"" should also be red. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" becomes clear:

"Given the examples provided, we can observe the following patterns:

- In every output sequence with ""walm,"" the color red repeats multiple times. However, the repetition of red seems to be influenced by another factor since it's not just the introduction of ""walm"" that dictates the number of times red appears.
- It appears that the number of times red is repeated corresponds to the number of words present before ""walm"" in the input sequence.

For instance:

1. Input: ""zup wif walm"" – Output: ""yellow red red red""
   - Two words before ""walm,"" hence ""red"" appears twice.

2. Input: ""dax lug walm zup wif"" – Output: ""green blue blue blue yellow red""
   - Two words before ""walm"" again, but unlike the previous examples, ""walm"" is followed by additional words, suggesting that the presence of additional words does not affect the rule since ""red"" appears twice only.

3. Input: ""wif bluf dax walm"" – Output: ""red red green green green""
   - Three words before ""walm,"" hence ""red"" appears three times.

4. Input: ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" – Output: ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow""
   - Four words before ""walm,"" hence ""red"" appears four times.

5. Input: ""zup walm"" – Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
   - One word before ""walm,"" hence ""red"" appears once, but it's not shown in the output because ""zup"" preceded ""walm,"" which correlates with ""yellow,"" and it perhaps overwrites the expected ""red"" due to its placement directly before ""walm.""

Combining these observations, we may deduce the rule for ""walm"" as follows:

**Rule:** ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color ""red"" in the output. The number of repetitions is equal to the number of words preceding ""walm"" in the input sequence, unless ""walm"" is directly proceeded by the word ""zup,"" which seems to transform the expected ""red"" into ""yellow."" 

Hence, based on the given examples: 
**walm -> meaning**: Repeat the color red for each word preceding ""walm"" in the input, unless directly preceded by ""zup"", which changes the output to yellow.",-0.5890202696869999,154,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to correlate with a repetition of the color that comes immediately before it in the output. The rule appears not to depend on the specific word before ""walm"" in the input, but rather on the color that word represents. Here are the observations from the examples:

- In the first input ""zup wif walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" The output for ""walm"" is ""red red red,"" indicating a threefold repetition of the color corresponding to ""wif.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and the output for ""walm"" is ""blue blue blue,"" repeating ""lug""'s corresponding color three times.
- The third instance shows ""wif bluf dax walm,"" where ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" and the output repetition for ""walm"" is ""green"" three times.
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and its mapping color ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- The fifth example is an instance where ""walm"" directly follows ""zup,"" and the output for ""walm"" is ""yellow"" repeated three times.

However, it's important to note that there's an inconsistency with the number of repetitions – in the fourth example, ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"" being repeated four times, while in all other examples ""walm"" results in a color being repeated three times.

Given this, two potential rules could be deduced:

Rule 1 (assuming a mistake in the fourth example):
walm -> Repetition of the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.

Rule 2 (considering all information literally):
walm -> Repetition of the color corresponding to the preceding word; the number of repetitions depends on an unknown factor.

Under the assumption that the number of repetitions should consistently be three (except for a potential mistake in the provided data), Rule 1 is likely the intended rule. But due to the inconsistency mentioned in the fourth example, there could be an additional rule or exception to be determined with more data.",-6.468536729919999,154,walm
"Analyzing the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to a series of repeating colors. This repetition is based on the color that follows ""walm"" in the sequence if given; if no color follows it, then ""walm"" appears to take the color of the word immediately preceding it. To verify:

- In the first example, ""zup wif walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" to red, and ""walm"" repeats the color red three times.
- In the second example, ""dax lug walm zup wif,"" ""dax"" is green, ""lug"" is blue, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""wif"" is red. ""Walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" which is yellow, and the output indeed repeats the color yellow once followed by red, which corresponds to ""wif.""
- In the third example, ""wif bluf dax walm,"" ""wif"" results in red, ""bluf"" does not have a direct correspondence but doesn't seem to affect the output, ""dax"" is green, and ""walm"" then repeats the color green three times.
- In the fourth example, ""wif zup lug dax zup walm,"" ""walm"" follows a sequence and then repeats the color of ""zup,"" which precedes it, resulting in three yellows.
- In the fifth example, ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" is yellow and ""walm"" takes that color and repeats it three times.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" represents a repetition of the color that follows it in the sequence if there is one. If ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence, it repeats the color of the word immediately before it three times.

Therefore, the definition is:
walm -> repeat the next color if there is one following it, otherwise, repeat the preceding color three times.",-7.178893777560001,154,walm
"Analyzing the given examples, let's break down each one to deduce what ""walm"" means:

1. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red""
- ""walm"" correlates with ""red red""

2. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green""
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue""
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red""
- ""walm"" correlates with ""blue blue""

3. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red""
- ""bluf"" does not directly correlate with a color, assuming for other inputs
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green""
- ""walm"" correlates with ""green green""

4. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red""
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue""
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green""
- ""walm"" correlates with ""yellow yellow yellow""

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
- ""walm"" correlates with ""yellow yellow""

Looking at the pattern, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color that comes immediately before it two more times. Therefore, ""walm"" could signify a repetition of the color word that precedes it in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color word before it two more times.",-7.234826757499,154,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" we need to identify patterns between the inputs and their outputs. Let's analyze each example.

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Looking at the examples, we notice the following:

1. The word ""walm"" always results in a repetition of the color word that precedes it.
2. The number of repetitions appears to be three, except for the last example, where ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and there are only two repetitions of ""yellow"".

At this point, it appears that ""walm"" triggers repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it, but we need to understand why there are two repetitions in the last example instead of the three observed in others.

However, upon closer inspection, the final ""yellow yellow yellow"" output isn't two repetitions of ""yellow,"" but rather it's the initial ""yellow"" that corresponds to ""zup"" followed by two additional ""yellow"" words triggered by ""walm."" This supports the idea that ""walm"" causes the color word before it to be repeated twice more.

Rule: walm -> causes the color word immediately before it to be repeated twice, effectively resulting in three consecutive appearances of that color word in the output sequence.",-8.35368118584,154,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each word corresponds to a color:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> blue

We see that in every example containing ""lug"", the output always includes blue, yet the position of ""lug"" within the input sequence and its corresponding output sequence does not always match up. However, when ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"", the output is ""blue blue blue,"" which suggests ""lug"" adds a blue element to the sequence. 

Now let's consider the examples without ""walm"" to infer a more general rule:

1. The sequence ""lug walm dax"" produced ""blue blue blue green,"" indicating that ""lug"" is directly associated with blue, ""walm"" with blue, and ""dax"" with green. The presence of ""lug"" does not seem to change the color associated with ""dax"".

2. In the sequence ""zup wif lug zup walm,"" we get ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"". Here, ""lug"" appears in the middle, and the colors before and after ""lug"" are not affected by its presence.

3. Looking at ""zup lug dax,"" we get ""yellow blue green,"" showing again that the presence of ""lug"" generates a blue without changing the colors mapped to ""zup"" or ""dax"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""lug"" on its own represents blue, and does not modify the color representation of words following it.

Rule: lug -> blue",-1.8293693739920003,155,lug
"To deduce what ""lug"" means, let's look at the context in each example:

In the first example, ""lug"" appears between ""dax"" and ""wif,"" which result in ""green"" and ""red,"" respectively. Therefore, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

In the second example, ""lug walm dax"" leads to ""blue blue blue green."" ""Dax"" at the end corresponds to ""green"" and since ""lug"" is at the beginning, and it has already been established that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" we can tentatively say that it still holds. For ""walm,"" since it produces three ""blue"" outputs, each ""walm"" represents a ""blue"" in this sequence.

In the third example, ""lug"" is between ""wif"" (which translates to ""red"") and ""zup"" (which is ""yellow""). Again, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

In the fourth example, ""lug"" appears between ""zup"" and ""dax,"" corresponding with ""yellow"" and ""green,"" respectively. Once more, ""lug"" is represented by ""blue.""

In the final example, “lug walm” leads to “blue blue blue,” which matches the pattern seen before where ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""walm"" appears to be consistently blue if it is at the end of the input or repeated.

The pattern holds in all examples that the word ""lug"" is consistently represented by the color ""blue."" 

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: lug -> blue.",-2.9259865313499995,155,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" To support this, let's examine the uses of ""lug"" in the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

- In the first example, ""lug"" precedes ""wif,"" which correlates to ""blue red."" Since we know ""wif"" is ""red"" from the second part of the output, ""lug"" must be ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" stands alone and is followed by ""walm"" and then ""dax."" The output ""blue blue blue"" indicates that both ""lug"" and ""walm"" map to ""blue,"" while we see in other examples that ""dax"" maps to ""green.""
- The third example has ""lug"" between ""wif"" and ""zup,"" translating to ""red blue yellow."" As we know from previous examples, ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" reinforcing that ""lug"" is ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" is between ""zup"" and ""dax,"" which correspond to ""yellow green,"" and as established before, ""lug"" would be ""blue.""
- The fifth example has ""lug"" followed by ""walm,"" which outputs ""blue blue blue,"" again supporting the understanding that both ""lug"" and ""walm"" are ""blue.""

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns in the provided examples. We have five examples where ""bluf"" is used in conjunction with other words that translate to colors in the outputs.

Let's decompose each example to understand the translation:

   Output: blue red red
   The word ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

2. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue

5. Input: dax bluf zup
   Output: green green yellow

From these examples, we can notice that the color translation is duplicated for the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" This suggests that ""bluf"" might double the color output of the previous word. Based on this inference:

Rule: ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be outputted twice in a row.",-6.030281881119,155,bluf

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the inputs and outputs, paying close attention to the words that precede and follow ""walm,"" and how they relate to the colors in the outputs.

Let's analyze the patterns:

1. ""zup walm wif"" always results in ""yellow yellow yellow red.""
   - ""zup"" -> yellow
   - ""wif"" -> red

2. ""wif walm lug bluf"" results in ""red red red blue blue.""
   - ""wif"" -> red
   - ""lug"" -> blue
   - ""bluf"" -> blue

3. ""dax walm wif dax"" results in ""green green green red green.""
   - ""dax"" -> green
   - ""wif"" -> red

4. ""lug walm zup lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue.""
   - ""lug"" -> blue
   - ""zup"" -> yellow

From the given examples, we see that the word right after ""walm"" (wif, lug, zup) is always repeated three times in the corresponding color sequence. Also, the word ""walm"" does not produce a unique color which indicates that it's likely a function of repetition rather than a direct color association.

Therefore, we can deduce:

Rule: ""walm"" indicates that the color associated with the following word should be repeated three times.

So, walm -> meaning is: ""Repeat the color associated with the following word three times.""

For clarity: 

- In ""zup walm wif,"" ""walm"" takes the color associated with ""wif"" (red) and repeats it three times.
- In ""wif walm lug,"" ""walm"" takes the color associated with ""lug"" (blue) and repeats it three times.
- And so on for other examples.
",-1.41844974274,155,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to repeat the preceding word's associated color three times before continuing with the next word's color. Here are the associations given in the examples:

- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green

Using these associations, let's look at each input and the corresponding output:

1. Input: zup walm wif | Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   - zup gives yellow
   - walm repeats the color of zup, which is yellow, three times
   - wif gives red

2. Input: wif walm lug bluf | Output: red red red blue blue
   - wif gives red
   - walm repeats the color of wif, which is red, three times
   - lug gives blue
   - bluf, while not directly associated with a color, seems to result in an additional color, which in this case is blue (repeated once).

3. Input: dax walm wif dax | Output: green green green red green
   - dax gives green
   - walm repeats the color of dax, which is green, three times
   - wif gives red
   - dax again gives green

4. Input: lug walm zup lug walm | Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   - lug gives blue
   - walm repeats the color of lug, which is blue, three times
   - zup gives yellow
   - lug gives blue again
   - walm repeats the color of the second lug, which is blue, three times

"walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" seems to indicate that the color associated with the previous word should be repeated. This is based on observing that whenever ""walm"" appears, the color that precedes it is repeated the number of times that matches the number of repetitions of ""walm"" plus one (the original occurrence). For example:

- ""zup walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow,"" so ""walm"" takes the color of ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" and repeats it one additional time.
- ""wif walm lug"" yields ""red red red blue,"" implying ""walm"" takes the color of ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" and repeats it twice (as there is no repetition of ""walm"" here, it just repeats once after the original).
- ""lug walm zup lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue,"" which shows ""walm"" first takes the color of ""lug"" (""blue""), repeats it twice, and after ""zup,"" it once again takes the color of the new word ""lug"" and repeats it twice after the original occurrence.

"Rule: walm -> the color of the word following walm is repeated three times, followed by the color of the word itself.

Explanation: 
- In the first example, ""zup"" is yellow and ""wif"" is red. The output after ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" which indicates that ""walm"" causes the next word's color to be repeated three times (yellow) followed by the color that represents ""walm"" (red).
- The second example is identical to the first, providing the same sequence and thus reinforcing the identified rule.
- In the third example, ""wif"" corresponds to red and ""lug"" corresponds to blue. Following ""walm,"" the color of ""wif"" is repeated three times (red red red) before ending with the color for ""walm"" (blue).
- The fourth example has ""dax"" representing green and ""wif"" representing red. After ""walm,"" red is repeated three times (green green green) and then followed by the color of ""walm,"" which is red.
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" represents blue and ""zup"" represents yellow. The output after each ""walm"" is the repeated color of the word that follows ""walm"" three times (blue blue blue and yellow yellow yellow) with each sequence followed by the color of ""walm"" itself (blue).

   Output: red red red blue blue

4. In ""dax walm wif dax,"" ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and following ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated three times; ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and the last ""dax"" is ""green"" again.
   Output: green green green red green

5. In ""lug walm zup lug walm,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and following the first ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times; ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue"" again, followed by ""walm"" which causes the previous color ""blue"" to be repeated now four times.
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue

The regularity here is that ""walm"" requires the color associated with the preceding word to be outputted three times plus the number of times ""walm"" has occurred in the sequence so far, which is an incrementing pattern.

- The third and fourth examples show ""zup"" followed by ""wif"" (and ""walm"" in the fourth), with ""wif"" corresponding to red. ""zup"" again corresponds to yellow.
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" is preceded by ""green green red"" and followed by ""red,"" which are the outputs for ""dax bluf wif,"" and ""zup wif"" respectively. In this instance, ""zup"" still corresponds to yellow.

After ""walm,"" the color corresponding to the previous word is repeated three times.

Here's how it breaks down:

- ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" produces ""green green green"" (for ""dax walm""), followed by ""red"" (for ""wif""), ""blue"" (for ""lug""), and again ""green green green"" (for ""dax walm"").
- ""zup walm"" simply produces ""yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" is yellow and is followed by ""walm.""
- ""dax walm zup"" first produces ""green green green"" (for ""dax walm"") followed by ""yellow"" (for ""zup"").
- ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" gives ""blue blue blue"" (for ""lug walm""), ""red"" (for ""wif""), ""blue"" (for ""lug""), and there seems to be an unidentified word ""bluf,"" which in absence of context, we cannot assign a color.
- ""zup dax walm"" gives us ""yellow"" (for ""zup""), followed by ""green green green"" (for ""dax walm"").

Analyzing these patterns:

- In example 1, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and is succeeded by ""wif"" and ""lug""; the corresponding output is three greens followed by a red. The sequence is repeated with ""dax walm"" again, which outputs three greens.
- In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" with no words after it; the output is three yellows.

   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" (but this contradicts with example 1, we need a pattern)

   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - The second ""green"" from ""bluf"" breaks the initial pattern, suggesting that ""bluf"" does not directly translate to ""green""

Considering all the examples, it seems like ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" unless it appears immediately after ""dax."" In this particular scenario, ""bluf"" represents a repetition of the previous color, ""green"" in the last example. This could indicate that ""bluf"" takes on the meaning of its previous word under specific conditions (after ""dax""), but otherwise means ""red."" 

However, no such specific condition is noticed in the provided examples other than the single instance in the last example. So it seems safe to assume that the apparent rule is that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" unless a complex rule is hidden which has not been exemplified.

In summary, the deduced rule is:

Rule: bluf -> red",-5.0197444716240005,157,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the correspondences in each sequence:

- ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red.""

Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif | Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" and is followed by an instance of ""yellow.""

- ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red"" at the end of the sequence.

Input: wif zup dax bluf | Output: red yellow green green
- ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""green.""

Observing the patterns, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color immediately before it, duplicating its output. So, if the word before ""bluf"" resulted in ""red,"" then ""bluf"" also results in ""red."" If the word before ""bluf"" resulted in ""blue,"" then ""bluf"" also results in ""blue,"" and so on.

It may indicate that ""bluf"" doubles the preceding color in the output sequence, or it might be a mistake. Assuming there is no mistake and because it is consistent with the last example where ""bluf"" also corresponds to doubling the color ""green"", we can set the rule as follows:

- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" indicating that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and that ""walm"" is causing the repetition of the word ""green"" three times.
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and that ""walm"" is causing the repetition of the word ""blue"" three times.
- ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" results in ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow.""

- ""lug walm"" being repeated shows consistency with the ""blue blue blue"" output.
- ""dax walm wif bluf"" results in ""green green green red red,"" indicating that ""walm"" repeated ""green"" three times and ""bluf"" is an additional rule that causes a double repetition of the previous color which in this case is ""red"" corresponding to ""wif.""

From the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" causes the output to be a repetition of a particular color word three times. The color word that is repeated corresponds to the word that is immediately before ""walm"" in the input sequence.

Here's how we can figure it out:

1. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" so we can infer that ""walm"" after ""dax"" leads to ""green"" being repeated thrice.
2. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" leading to the conclusion that ""walm"" after ""lug"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated thrice.
3. In the input ""wif walm zup lug zup walm,"" the occurrence of ""walm"" after ""wif"" results in ""red red red,"" and the occurrence of ""walm"" after ""lug"" consequently leads to ""yellow yellow yellow."" This suggests that ""walm"" replicates the color associated with the preceding word three times.
4. The final input example, ""dax walm wif bluf,"" sticks to the established pattern: ""walm"" after ""dax"" once again results in ""green green green,"" and we see an extra color ""red red"" from the final two words ""wif bluf.""

Based on the examples above, the meaning of ""walm"" in these contexts follows the rule:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, it triggers the output of three consecutive repetitions of a specific color associated with the preceding word. ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""",-4.8645645023199995,157,walm
"Rule: ""walm"" seems to mean ""repeat the color associated with the previous word."" 

For each instance of ""walm"" in the input, the output is the color associated with the previous word repeated three times. 

Examples:
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In ""wif walm zup lug zup walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""wif walm"" becomes ""red red red,"" then ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" and ""zup walm"" follows ""lug"" so the ""blue"" is repeated three times to get ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- ""lug walm"" is consistent with the second example, with ""lug"" leading to ""blue blue blue.""
- ""dax walm wif bluf"" starts with ""dax"" leading to a ""green"" repetition due to ""walm,"" and then ""wif"" results in ""red,"" which is doubled due to ""bluf"" which does not have an associated color; hence no repetition of color occurs.

"To figure out the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we can analyze the common patterns in the examples provided. 

We’ll start by mapping the known words to their associated colors:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

Now let’s examine the outputs in relation to the word ""bluf"":

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" ""wif,"" or ""lug,"" the output color is the same as the color assigned to these words:
   - dax bluf -> green green
   - wif bluf dax -> red red green
   - dax lug bluf wif -> green blue blue red

2. When ""bluf"" is at the end or between words of different colors, the output color repeats the color of the preceding word:
   - dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red
   - dax zup lug bluf -> green yellow blue blue

From these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" functions as a repetition indicator for the color output of the word that precedes it. If the preceding word is ""dax"" it outputs ""green,"" same for ""red"" when preceding word is ""wif,"" ""yellow"" when it is ""zup,"" and ""blue"" when it is ""lug.""

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.",-2.74767347556,159,bluf

2. Input: dax bluf

Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

In the third example,

In the fourth example,
Input: dax zup lug bluf

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" changes depending on the word that comes before it. It does not have a fixed color output but rather mirrors the color associated with the previous word.

"Based on the provided examples, one can observe that the word ""bluf"" seems to elicit an output that repeats the color associated with the preceding word. To construct the rule for ""bluf,"" let's examine the inputs and corresponding outputs one by one:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color associated with the word immediately before it.",-8.236521484,159,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word 'walm' seems to trigger a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, followed by the color transformation of 'walm' itself. We can deduce this because in each instance where 'walm' appears, the color word that precedes it is repeated three times before another color is given. Here's the breakdown:

Example 1: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", so when ""walm"" follows, we get ""yellow yellow yellow"" and then ""red"". This suggests that ""walm"" might in itself correspond to ""red"" after it induces the repetition.

Example 2: ""zup walm"" again repeats ""yellow"" three times (corresponding to ""zup"") before the sequence ends, as there is no further color indication for ""walm"".

Example 3: With ""wif"" corresponding to ""red"", ""walm"" causes three repetitions of ""red"", followed by ""yellow"", which suggests the effect of ""walm"" is applied but the color of ""zup"" appears at the end instead.

Example 4: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""walm"" results in three repetitions of ""green"", followed by ""blue"".

Example 5: Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is followed by ""wif"" which is ""red"". ""Walm"" then causes ""wif"" to be repeated thrice as ""red red red"".

From these examples, we can induce the following rule:

walm -> Causes the color corresponding to the previous word to be repeated three times, and then outputs a color transformation unique to 'walm', which seems in context to be ""red"".

Rule: If 'X' is a color word, then ""X walm"" results in ""Color of X"" repeated three times followed by ""red"".",-2.491947154294,159,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can infer that the word ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it. Here is the rule deduced from the inputs and outputs provided:

- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"", meaning one extra ""yellow"" is added to the output for ""zup walm""
- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"", meaning one extra ""red"" is added to the output for ""wif walm""
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"", meaning one extra ""green"" is added to the output for ""dax walm""
- When ""walm"" is in the middle of the input, the color that corresponds to the word before it is repeated for the rest of the sequence, such as in ""zup wif walm"" leading to ""yellow red red red""

Based on this pattern, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color associated with the preceding word for the remainder of the sequence. 

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word for the rest of the sequence.",-2.679443942812,159,walm
"Looking at the patterns, each input word corresponds to a certain color in the output. The word ""walm"" appears in different positions within the input sequence but always results in a repetition of the color associated with the word just before it. The last color in the sequence ""walm"" appears in is different and does not follow the repetition.

Here's the breakdown:

- In the first input, ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow."" Since the word ""zup"" is associated with yellow, ""walm"" seems to cause the repetition of ""yellow.""
- In the third input, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red."" Thus, when ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the color ""red"" is repeated.
- In the fourth input, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green."" Here ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""green.""
- In the last input, ""wif walm"" in the context of ""zup wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" maintaining the pattern.

The last color of the output sequence differs when ""walm"" is the last input word, suggesting that the presence of ""walm"" at the end either changes the rule or follows a different rule altogether.

Therefore, the rule appears to be: When ""walm"" follows another word, it causes the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word. If ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence, it outputs a different color that doesn't follow the immediate repetition rule and may be dependent on the preceding word (e.g., ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" when following ""walm"").

Rule: walm -> causes the previous color to repeat. When it's the last word, it results in a different color which might be determined by a different rule.",-3.8934486084200004,159,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should examine the pattern of outputs in relation to their respective inputs:

- The output color sequence seems to be exclusively composed of three or four repeated colors.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is three ""yellow"" followed by another color.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is three ""red"" followed by another color.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is three ""green"" followed by another color.
- When ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, as seen in ""zup wif walm,"" the color that repeats seems to be the one associated with the word directly before ""walm.""

Given these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""walm"" three times in the output; if there is a word after ""walm,"" add the color associated with that word once at the end.

Rule: If ""walm"" is the last word, repeat the associated color of the previous word three times. If ""walm"" is followed by another word, repeat the associated color of the previous word three times, and finish with the associated color of the word following ""walm.""",-4.452797471568,159,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's review the examples given and look for patterns in the inputs and outputs:

- Input: zup walm wif | Output: yellow yellow yellow red
- Input: zup walm | Output: yellow yellow yellow
- Input: wif walm zup | Output: red red red yellow
- Input: dax walm lug | Output: green green green blue
- Input: zup wif walm | Output: yellow red red red

Observing the outputs, we notice that the presence of ""walm"" in the sentence generates a repetition of a color with an additional color at the end if there is another word following ""walm.""

- In the first and third examples, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" and the output ends with ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the output ends with ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and we see an additional ""red"" in the output.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" generates a repetition of the color associated with the word before it and takes the color of the following word if there is one, repeating the color of the previous word three times before taking on the color of the word that follows it.

However, if ""walm"" is the last word (as in the second example), only the color associated with the word before ""walm"" is repeated thrice in the output.

Based on this pattern, we can posit that ""walm"" has a function of repetition and transition between the colors associated with the words in the input sentence.

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it three times in the output. If ""walm"" is followed by another word, the final color in the output is the color associated with the word after ""walm.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we will analyze the given input and its corresponding output color patterns.

From analyzing the examples, we can see the following correlations:

- Whenever the word ""dax"" is present, the output is ""green.""
- The instances with only ""dax"" result in only ""green.""
- When ""dax"" precedes other words, like ""walm"" or ""zup,"" the following word gets the color ""green"" as well.
- When ""dax"" follows a word like ""lug,"" only ""dax"" is ""green"" while ""lug"" gets the color ""blue.""
- In the third input, ""lug dax wif,"" we see that ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""wif"" is ""red.""
- The sequence ""zup dax walm"" results in ""yellow green green green,"" which suggests that ""dax"" possibly turns the following word into ""green,"" but the presence of multiple ""dax"" words seems to create a chain effect on subsequent words.

Given the data, the rule seems to be that ""dax"" turns any following word into ""green"" unless interrupted by another word which has a predetermined color (like ""lug"" being ""blue""). However, there is not enough information to determine the colors for the other nonce words or to establish if there are specific triggers or conditions that cause ""dax"" not to affect the following word.

"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's examine how its output is influenced by its position relative to other words in the input. Starting from the provided examples:

1. Input: zup
   Output: yellow
   
   Here, ""zup"" is the only word and it maps directly to ""yellow"", establishing a base case.

2. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   
   Here, ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"" which has given us three ""yellow"" in the output which suggest that, ""zup"" has the effect of duplicating the color that comes right after it in the output, three times. The same could be said before ""zup"" as ""lug"" gives out ""blue"" but it has shown just once.

3. Input: lug zup
   Output: blue yellow
   
   Again, ""lug"" shows us one ""blue"" and ""zup"" shows us one ""yellow"" in the output so disregarding the second example above, our rule can be stated as there's no duplication of colors for ""lug"".

4. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   
   ""Zup"" is followed by ""bluf,"" which yields two ""yellow"" and then ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" gives us ""red"" three times. Since there's a duplcation before ""zup"" it doesn't mean there's any specific rule behind ""zup"" to make a duplication. We need more examples to be sure of that one, but according to this example, it doesn't make a duplication.

5. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red

   ""Zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" which yields three ""yellow"" and then one ""red"" for ""wif"", showing there's a duplication for ""walm"".

Considering the information provided above, there are conflicting indications on whether ""zup"" itself induces duplication of colors. According to examples 2 and 5, ""walm"" seems to be duplicated following ""zup,"" but this does not hold true for any word other than ""walm"" since in example 3, ""lug"" didn't provide any duplication.

Based on the evidence provided, it is safe to infer that ""zup"" translates into ""yellow,"" but we do not have a definitive or consistent rule regarding the duplication effect it has in relation to other words. More examples would be needed to establish if ""zup"" has any rule-based effect on duplication or if that effect is due to the word that follows ""zup.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",-10.363815832600002,160,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" causes the preceding word's corresponding color to be repeated. Therefore, when ""bluf"" follows a word, the output is the color associated with that word, repeated twice. To clarify this rule:

1. ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, and ""bluf"" makes it repeat.
2. ""wif lug bluf"" becomes ""red blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""bluf"" makes it repeat.
3. ""zup dax bluf"" becomes ""yellow green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""bluf"" makes it repeat.
4. ""lug zup bluf dax"" becomes ""blue yellow yellow green"" because ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""bluf"" makes it repeat. ""Dax"" is unrelated to the ""bluf"" rule in this sequence.
5. ""wif bluf dax walm"" becomes ""red red green green green"" because ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""bluf"" makes it repeat, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" seems to make the preceding color repeat (in this case, it appears once due to ""dax"" and twice more due to ""walm"").

"Given the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" has an impact on the output that follows it. Let's look at the correspondence between input and output:

1. ""wif walm dax zup"" outputs ""red red red green yellow""
2. ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" outputs ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow""
3. ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow""
4. ""zup walm dax lug"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow green blue""
5. ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red""

Notably, after the word ""walm"" all subsequent words correspond to an output with their color repeated three times, until another occurrence of ""walm"", which will reset and the process will begin again.

For example:
- In the first sequence, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" and ""zup"", both of which generate three of the same color (green for ""dax"" and yellow for ""zup"")
- In the second sequence, ""walm"" is twice in the sequence. After the first ""walm"", ""lug"" generates three reds and ""zup"" generates three yellows; after the second ""walm"", we see another set of three yellows for ""zup"".

Thus, we can define ""walm"" as a word that causes the output color to be repeated three times for all following words until another ""walm"" resets this rule.

Rule: walm -> Triplicates the color output for subsequent words until another ""walm"" appears.",-1.1740324729,160,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to correspond to a repeating of the color that is associated with the word that comes before ""walm."" To further clarify, whenever ""walm"" is used, the color output associated with the preceding word is repeated for the number of times ""walm"" appears. Here is what we can deduce from the examples:

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and when ""walm"" follows, it repeats ""red"" two more times to make a total of three reds.
- In the second example, the word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and it is followed by ""wif"" which is ""red."" Then ""walm"" appears twice, so the ""red"" which came just before the first ""walm"" is repeated for each instance of ""walm,"" resulting in four instances of red output.
- In the third example, ""zup"" by itself corresponds to ""yellow."" The following ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" two more times for a total of three yellows.
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" is ""green"", followed by ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue."" The succeeding ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it, which is ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats the ""red"" color twice more.

"From the given examples, it seems that the presence of the word ""walm"" results in repeats of the color that directly follows it. Let's analyze the patterns:

- Input: wif walm dax zup
  Output: red red red green yellow
  In this instance, ""walm"" is directly followed by ""dax,"" which corresponds to the color red. The color red is then repeated three times.

- Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
  Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
  Here ""lug"" follows the first ""walm,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to blue. The color blue is repeated once. The second ""walm"" is followed by the end of the sequence, which corresponds to yellow. The color yellow is repeated three times.

- Input: zup walm
  Output: yellow yellow yellow
  Here ""walm"" is followed by the end of the sequence (or possibly considered to be followed by ""zup"" again), which corresponds to yellow. The color yellow is repeated three times.

- Input: zup walm dax lug
  Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
  ""Walm"" is followed by ""dax"" which corresponds to green, and green appears once, not repeated. This suggests that perhaps repetition happens only when ""walm"" is at the end or followed by non-""dax"" elements.

- Input: wif walm
  Output: red red red
  ""Walm"" follows ""wif"" and there is no subsequent color word. ""Wif"" corresponds to red and we see it tripled.

We can see a trend that when ""walm"" is at the end or is followed by any elements but ""dax"", the color corresponding to the following word is repeated typically three times (or maybe the color before it if it is the last word). However, when followed by ""dax,"" the following color is not repeated unless ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, as seen in the second example where ""lug"" is blue but it is only said once, as opposed to being repeated.

3. In the fourth example, ""wif"" comes between ""zup"" (yellow) and precedes ""bluf"" which doesn't appear in any other examples, but the presence of ""wif"" results in ""red"" preceding ""bluf.""

4. In the fifth example, ""wif"" follows ""dax"" (green) and precedes ""walm,"" which doesn't have a direct comparison, but looking at the pattern once more, the word ""wif"" produces ""red"" in the output.

Thus, in all cases, regardless of what follows or precedes ""wif,"" the output associated with ""wif"" is consistently ""red.""

"To deduce the meaning or rule of ""wif,"" let's look at the consistent patterns from the given examples.

- The position of ""red"" in the output seems to align with the position of ""wif"" in the input.

Based on these observations, we can conclude that:

The rule for ""bluf"" is:

Rule: bluf -> the word ""bluf"" means repeat the color word that immediately precedes it.",-3.575263364279999,161,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine the given examples and outputs to identify any patterns.

Input: lug wif lug bluf
Output: blue red blue blue

Input: wif zup bluf lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue

Input: wif lug bluf
Output: red blue blue

Input: wif bluf lug dax wif
Output: red red blue green red

Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green

By analyzing the inputs and outputs, it seems that the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" determines its meaning. Specifically, ""bluf"" mimics the color associated with the word that comes right before it in the input sequence:

- When ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue"") precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue.""
- When ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red"") precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""red.""
- When ""dax"" (which corresponds to ""green"") precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""green.""
- The word ""zup"" has not been shown to immediately precede ""bluf"" directly, but it is associated with the color ""yellow"" elsewhere, which doesn't give us a direct correlation based on the examples so it is disregarded for inferring the rule.

Based on this pattern, the rule for ""bluf"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word that precedes it.

Therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> The color value of the preceding word.",-7.101532154446,161,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue"" when followed by the word ""lug"", which itself translates to ""red"". However, when ""bluf"" is preceded by the words ""wif"" or ""dax"", the word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red"" or ""green"", respectively. 

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" reflects the color associated with the word that immediately follows it, with ""lug"" being an exception that causes ""bluf"" to be ""blue"" no matter what.

Rule: bluf -> ""blue"" when followed by ""lug""; otherwise, ""bluf"" takes the color of the immediately following word's associated color.",-7.801191184282,161,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. Meaning: bluf appears to correspond to the color blue when it is the last word in a sequence, or when followed by another color. However, when bluf is followed by 'lug,' the next color changes to red instead. When it is followed by 'dax,' the next color changes to green. The color before bluf doesn't influence its meaning. It is consistently followed by blue unless the subsequent word is 'lug' or 'dax,' which changes the following color.

Rule: bluf translates to ""blue,"" but it also changes the color word immediately after it to red if that word is 'lug,' and to green if that word is 'dax.'",-8.98105404876,161,bluf
"Analyzing the given examples and their corresponding outputs, it seems that ""walm"" affects the sequence of colors before it. Whenever ""walm"" appears, the preceding color word is repeated a number of times equal to the total number of colors outputted before ""walm"" came into play. For example:

- In example 1, ""lug"" (blue) appears three times before ""walm"", so after ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- In example 2, only one color, ""dax"" (green), appears before ""walm"", thus ""green"" is repeated three times after ""walm"".
- In example 3, ""wif"" (red) appears once before ""walm"", so ""red"" is repeated three times after ""walm"".
- In example 4, ""wif"" (red) appears once before ""walm"", and ""dax"" (green) is the first color. So ""red"" is repeated three times after ""walm"".
- In example 5, ""dax"" (green) is the first word and it appears once before the first ""walm"", leading to three ""greens"". Next, ""wif"" (red) appears once before the second ""walm"", so ""red"" is repeated three times.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

"To deduce the rule, let's inspect each input-output pair and look for patterns:

1. Input: dax lug walm  
   Output: green blue blue blue  
   Notes: 'dax' corresponds to 'green'. 'lug walm' may collectively correspond to 'blue blue blue' or 'lug' to 'blue' and 'walm' to 'blue blue'.

2. Input: dax zup  
   Output: green yellow  
   Notes: 'dax' is 'green' again, 'zup' is 'yellow'.

3. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug  
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue  
   Notes: 'zup' is consistent with 'yellow', 'dax' is consistent with 'green'; 'lug' and 'walm' appear together again after 'dax', followed by 'blue blue blue'. This reinforces the idea that 'lug' corresponds to single 'blue' and 'walm' to 'blue blue'. Also, the last 'lug' corresponds with a single 'blue', confirming the rule further.

5. Input: dax bluf

Considering the consistency across examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: 'dax' corresponds to the color 'green' regardless of its position or the context in which it appears. Every appearance of 'dax' translates to 'green'. Other words seem to correspond with different colors: 'zup' with 'yellow', 'lug' with 'blue', and 'walm' with 'blue blue' (this could mean that 'walm' denotes a repetition of the color blue).

- ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the color is red both times (""wif bluf"" -> red red).
- ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and the color is blue both times (""lug bluf"" -> blue blue).

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word.",-0.8328698964599999,162,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning or the rule associated with the nonce word ""bluf"". Let's analyze the instances where ""bluf"" appears and observe the corresponding output:

1. In the first example, ""dax bluf zup"" corresponds to ""green green yellow"". Since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in both the first and second examples, and considering that ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green"" in the first example, it seems like ""bluf"" might represent the same color as the word that precedes it.

2. In the second example, ""wif bluf dax"" corresponds to ""red red green"". Here, ""wif"" is ""red"" and is immediately followed by ""bluf"", which is also ""red"". This seems to support our initial observation that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word.

3. The third example, ""dax zup wif bluf lug"", translates to ""green yellow red red blue"". In this sequence, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" (which is ""red"") and ""bluf"" is also ""red"", further reinforcing our hypothesis.

4. In the fourth example, ""lug bluf"" yields ""blue blue"", which again follows the pattern of ""bluf"" taking on the color of the word before it, as ""lug"" is ""blue"".

5. Finally, the fifth example, ""lug wif bluf lug wif"", maps to ""blue red red blue red"". Here, ""bluf"" happens twice: once after ""wif"" which is ""red"", and ""bluf"" is ""red"", and once before ""lug"" which is ""blue"". This second occurrence breaks the pattern we've seen, as ""bluf"" does not mirror the color of ""wif"" but instead corresponds to the color of ""lug"" that follows it. This suggests that ""bluf"" might take on the color of the word that either precedes or follows it.

Based on these observations, we could conclude that ""bluf"" takes the color of an adjacent word, whether it's the one that precedes or follows it. However, in all provided examples, the color that ""bluf"" takes is the one from the preceding word. There's no example given where ""bluf"" needs to take the color of the following word.

From these examples, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" takes the color attribute of the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.",-0.9195637215720002,162,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the meaning of ""bluf"" can be deduced by analyzing the color output in relation to its position and possibly the words around it. Take note of the consistency in color when ""bluf"" appears:

1. ""dax bluf zup"" results in ""green green yellow""
2. ""wif bluf dax"" results in ""red red green""
3. ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" results in ""green yellow red red blue""
4. ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue""
5. ""lug wif bluf lug wif"" results in ""blue red red blue red""

Looking at the outputs, when ""bluf"" follows a word, that word's corresponding color is repeated for ""bluf."" For example:

- In ""dax bluf zup,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green and so does the immediately following ""bluf.""
- In ""wif bluf dax,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red and so does ""bluf.""
- In ""lug bluf,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue and so does ""bluf.""

Based on this observation, we can assert the rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the previous word.",-1.1482563259540002,162,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" means ""copy"". It is used to duplicate the color associated with the previous word.

Explanation:

- In the first example, ""dax bluf zup"", the color associated with ""dax"" is green; hence, ""bluf"" also yields green, followed by ""zup"" which produces yellow.
- In the second example, ""wif bluf dax"", ""wif"" leads to red, so ""bluf"" replicates this color as red, while ""dax"" is associated with green.
- In the third example, the series is ""dax zup wif bluf lug"". ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""zup"" to yellow, ""wif"" to red, ""bluf"" duplicates the color of the word before it, ""wif,"" so it is red. ""lug"" then is blue.
- In ""lug bluf"", ""lug"" is associated with blue and ""bluf"" duplicates this color as blue.
- Lastly, in ""lug wif bluf lug wif"", we have ""lug"" associated with blue, ""wif"" with red, ""bluf"" duplicates the color before it, which is red, another ""lug"" follows with blue, and finally ""wif"" again with red.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes on the color associated with the immediately preceding word in the sequence.

bluf -> ""copy"" (the color of the previous word).",-2.36062605042,162,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word that follows it. When ""bluf"" is the last word, it defaults to the color blue. Here are the breakdowns:

1. In ""dax bluf zup,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup,"" and the output is ""green green yellow."" Since ""dax"" is green and ""zup"" is yellow, it follows that ""bluf"" has the same color as ""dax,"" which precedes it.
   
2. In ""wif bluf dax,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" which is green. Therefore, ""bluf"" takes on the red color from ""wif.""

3. In ""dax zup wif bluf lug,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" which means it takes on the red color from ""wif,"" which precedes ""bluf.""

4. In ""lug bluf,"" ""bluf"" is the last word and defaults to the color blue.

5. In ""lug wif bluf lug wif,"" again ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" which is blue. Therefore, it takes on the red color from ""wif,"" which precedes ""bluf.""

"From these examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" causes the color mentioned after ""walm"" to repeat the number of times equal to the number of colors mentioned before ""walm"". Let's look at each example:

1. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   Explanation: The colors before ""walm"" are blue, blue, green and blue (4 colors), so the color after ""walm"" (yellow) repeats 4 times.

2. Input: lug dax walm
   Output: blue green green green
   Explanation: The colors before ""walm"" are blue and green (2 colors), so the color after ""walm"" (green) repeats 2 times.

3. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   Explanation: The color before ""walm"" is blue (1 color), so the color after ""walm"" (blue) repeats 1 more time (hence two blues in a row), then the pattern continues as normal.

4. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow
   Explanation: The color before ""walm"" is red (1 color), so the color after ""walm"" (red) repeats 1 more time (three reds in a row).

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Explanation: The color before ""walm"" is yellow (1 color), so the color after ""walm"" (yellow) repeats 1 more time (total of two yellows in a row).

From these examples, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the following color a number of times equal to the number of distinct colors mentioned before ""walm"" in the sequence. If ""walm"" is the first word or if the color appearing immediately before ""walm"" has not been preceded by any other colors, then repeat that color an additional time.",-5.961074370914,162,walm
"Considering the examples provided, we can deduce that the nonce word walm must be related to the repetition of the color denoted by the word immediately preceding it. To confirm this, let's look at each instance:

1. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - Here after 'zup', 'walm' causes the output of 'yellow' to be repeated.

2. Input: lug dax walm
   Output: blue green green green
   - After 'dax', 'walm' triggers a repetition of 'green'.

3. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif

   - 'Walm' is after 'lug', causing 'blue' to be repeated.

4. Input: wif walm zup

   - 'Walm' follows 'wif' and 'red' is repeated.

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - 'Walm' follows 'zup' so 'yellow' is repeated.

From these observations, we can induce that the rule for 'walm' is to repeat the output color associated with the word before 'walm'.

Therefore, the deduced rule for the nonce word ""walm"" is as follows:

"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color blue in the given examples.",-8.320221501852,163,lug
"To deduce what ""dax"" means, I will analyze the outputs associated with it in various contexts provided in the examples.

In the first and third examples, ""dax"" is the only input, and the output is singular: ""green"". This suggests that ""dax"" by itself translates directly to the word ""green"".

In the second example, ""dax"" is followed by sets of three words (""walm zup lug walm""), and the output is ""green green green yellow blue blue blue"". Here, ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green"". The word ""walm"", which appears twice, corresponds to ""yellow blue blue blue"". This gives us a bit of a pattern where each individual word might correspond to a specific color. However, ""walm"" changing colors between ""yellow"" and ""blue"" would be strange unless it's affected by its position or surrounding words, but given the limited information, this interpretation remains uncertain.

In the fourth example, ""dax"" appears at the end of the sequence and the corresponding output is ""yellow blue blue blue red green"". Since the ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green"" at the end of the sequence, its meaning seems to remain consistent regardless of its position.

Finally, in the fifth example, ""dax"" is followed by ""zup bluf"" and the output is ""green yellow yellow"". Here again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". 

Based on the provided data, the rule seems to be that ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green"", irrespective of its position or the words that follow or precede it.

Therefore, the rule I can induce is:

Rule: dax -> green. ""Dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".",-1.4016550844400002,163,dax
"Based on the examples given, we can infer the following:

1. When ""dax"" is mentioned alone, the output is ""green"".
2. When ""dax"" is mentioned with other words, such as ""walm"", ""zup"", and ""lug"", it still corresponds to the output ""green"".
3. Other words like ""zup"" and ""lug"" appear to consistently correspond to the color ""yellow"" and ""blue"" respectively, regardless of their position relative to ""dax"".
4. The word ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in triple the outcome (green green green) followed by ""yellow blue blue blue"", suggesting that ""walm"" duplicates the color outputs for the preceding word or pattern.
5. The word ""wif"" before ""dax"" produces ""red green"" which implies that ""wif"" might have a standalone output of ""red"" and does not influence the output of ""dax"".

Given these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". The output for ""dax"" remains consistent as ""green"" regardless of its position or the presence of other words. Other context words affect their own output but do not change the output associated with ""dax"".",-3.0075753515800003,163,dax

However, other words also translate to colors, with ""walm"" consistently translating to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The word ""wif"" appears once and translates to ""red.""

Based on the examples, here is the induction for ""dax"" and the other words provided:

Rule:
- dax -> green
- walm -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red

The meaning of ""dana"" is the same as the color indicated by the output consistently across the examples.",-6.329894213219999,163,dax
"Based on the provided input-output pairs, each instance of ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green."" There is a one-to-one relationship between ""dax"" and ""green"" regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence. Additionally, other words such as ""walm,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug"" appear to translate consistently to a series of colors, suggesting this is a word-to-color mapping challenge.

From the examples provided:

- ""dax"" always results in ""green.""
- ""walm"" translates into a repeated sequence of ""blue"" based on the second example.
- ""zup"" translates into a sequence of ""yellow,"" but not repeated in the fifth example, possibly due to the presence of a single ""zup.""
- ""lug"" has translated to ""blue"" in the second example, but since ""walm"" also translates to ""blue"" and ""lug"" appears before the ""bluf"" which translates to twice ""yellow"" without repetition in the third example, it is possible that ""lug"" might be the trigger for a repeated sequence, but without more examples, this is speculative.
- ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow,"" followed by another ""yellow.""

Given the information above, the induced rule is:

Rule: ""dax"" represents the color ""green"" irrespective of its position or the context in which it appears.",-6.7037918331,163,dax

- ""zup wif dax"" -> ""yellow red green""

Here ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and it seems that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" as it is the common color between the two outputs following ""dax"".

For the third example:
- ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow""
 
In this example, ""wif walm dax"" corresponds to ""red red red green"" and it confirms that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" as it comes after ""dax"" and is represented by ""yellow"" in the output.

For the fourth and fifth examples:
- ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow""
- ""wif zup bluf"" -> ""red yellow yellow""

In both cases, ""zup"" comes before ""bluf"" and in both outputs ""yellow"" precedes the color representing ""bluf"" which is ""yellow"". This confirms that regardless of the previous word, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

"Based on the examples given, the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to correlate directly with repeating the color associated with the word that precedes it. Here's how we can determine this:

- In the first example, ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green""; ""dax"" seems to stand for ""green,"" and ""bluf"" leads to a repetition of that color.
- In the second example, ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" corresponds to ""red red blue green red""; ""wif"" correlates to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" causes the ""red"" to repeat. ""lug"" correlates to ""blue,"" but ""bluf"" is not directly after it, so ""blue"" is not repeated. Then, ""dax"" again translates to ""green.""
- In the third example, ""lug bluf"" leads to ""blue blue,"" reinforcing the idea that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it.
- The fourth example, ""lug bluf wif,"" results in ""blue blue red""; ""bluf"" repeats the blue associated with ""lug"" but has no effect on ""wif"" since it follows ""bluf.""
- The fifth example, ""wif dax bluf,"" results in ""red green green""; ""bluf"" repeats the green from ""dax"" but does not affect ""wif"" as it precedes ""dax.""

"Rule: The word bluf means ""repeat the color of the previous word"". 

In each instance, the color associated with the word immediately before bluf is repeated.

Similarly, ""lug bluf"" becomes ""blue blue""; the color for lug is blue, which is repeated by bluf.",-3.67715284756,163,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the word that directly precedes it. Here's the analysis:

Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green
The word 'dax' corresponds to the color 'green', and 'bluf' results in repeating that color.

Input: wif bluf lug dax wif -> Output: red red blue green red
The word 'wif' before 'bluf' corresponds to 'red', so 'bluf' repeats the color 'red'. 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', and 'dax' corresponds to 'green'. The sequence ends with 'wif', which corresponds to 'red'.

Input: lug bluf -> Output: blue blue
The word 'lug' corresponds to the color 'blue', and 'bluf' repeats that color.

Input: lug bluf wif -> Output: blue blue red
Again, 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', 'bluf' repeats 'blue', and the sequence ends with 'wif' which corresponds to 'red'.

Input: wif dax bluf -> Output: red green green
Here, 'wif' corresponds to 'red', 'dax' corresponds to 'green', and 'bluf' repeats the color associated with 'dax', which is 'green'.

- dax (green) lug (blue) walm -> green blue blue blue
  ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug"", which is blue, three times.

- dax (green) wif (red) walm lug (blue) zup (yellow) walm -> green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
  ""walm"" first repeats the color of ""wif"", which is red, three times, and later repeats the color of ""zup"", which is yellow, three times.

- dax (green) walm -> green green green
  ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax"", which is green, three times.

- dax (green) walm -> green green green
  Same as the previous example, ""walm"" repeats ""dax"", green, three times.

- zup (yellow) lug (blue) zup (yellow) walm dax (green) wif (red) bluf
  ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup"", which is yellow, three times. ""bluf"" is not followed by a color output, which might imply it's irrelevant to the pattern or an end of sequence marker.

Furthermore, each of the original words (""dax"", ""lug"", ""zup"", ""wif"") has an associated color (""green"", ""blue"", ""yellow"", ""red""), and ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word multiple times.

2. Example: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   Analysis: The color red, which follows 'wif', is repeated three times after 'walm'; later, yellow, which follows 'zup', is also repeated three times after 'walm'.

3. Example: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Analysis: The color green which is related to 'dax', is repeated two additional times after 'walm'.

4. Example: dax walm

5. Example: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf

From these observations, the rule associated with 'walm' seems to be: repeat the color of the word immediately preceding 'walm' three more times.

- ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" hence when paired with ""bluf,"" it results in ""yellow yellow.""
- ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" hence when paired with ""bluf,"" it results in ""red red.""

If we analyze the repetition pattern, it appears that ""walm"" results in a string of ""yellow"" outputs of length one more than the number of words between ""dax"" and ""walm."" Let's confirm this with the given examples:

1. Input: ""wif dax zup walm"" -> Output: ""red green yellow yellow yellow""
   - ""walm"" occurs after one word (""zup"") following ""dax,"" resulting in three ""yellow"" outputs.

2. Input: ""lug dax walm wif"" -> Output: ""blue green green green red""
   - ""walm"" occurs immediately after ""dax,"" resulting in two ""yellow"" outputs (here substituted by ""green"" for some reason).

3. Input: ""zup dax walm"" -> Output: ""yellow green green green""
   - ""walm"" occurs immediately after ""dax,"" resulting in two ""yellow"" outputs (substituted by ""green"" again).

4. Input: ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" -> Output: ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow""
   - The first ""walm"" occurs after one word (""wif"") following ""dax,"" resulting in three ""yellow"" outputs (substituted by ""red"" here). 
   - The second ""walm"" occurs after two words (""lug zup"") following the first ""walm,"" and it results in three ""yellow"" outputs.

5. Input: ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow red red red""
   - ""walm"" occurs after two words (""bluf wif"") following ""zup,"" resulting in three ""yellow"" outputs.

The substitution of ""yellow"" with other colors seems inconsistent and may be influenced by other words in the sequence or a separate rule unrelated to ""walm."" Hence, we can't draw a conclusive rule for that pattern. However, for the purpose of the word ""walm,"" we can deduce:

Rule: ""walm"" results in a series of ""yellow"" color outputs with the length being one more than the number of words between ""dax"" and ""walm.""",-0.55599471432,164,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let us look at the corresponding outputs for each input, isolating the appearances of ""walm"" and their respective outputs:

1. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   - walm corresponds to three ""yellow""

2. Input: lug dax walm wif
   Output: blue green green green red
   - walm corresponds to three ""green""

3. Input: zup dax walm
   Output: yellow green green green
   - walm corresponds to three ""green""

4. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm

   - walm first corresponds to three ""red"" and then two ""yellow""

5. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - walm corresponds to three ""red""

Looking at all the instances, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color of the word that immediately precedes it. More specifically, it repeats the color of the previous word three times except in the case where a new word follows ""walm"", then it repeats the color of the preceding word one less time than it would have without the additional word.

To generalize this:

Rule: walm -> repetition of the color of the preceding word. The number of repetitions is usually three, but it reduces by one when a new word follows immediately after ""walm.""

Example: In ""dax wif walm lug,"" walm results in ""red red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" However, in ""dax wif walm lug zup walm,"" the first ""walm"" gives ""red red red"" because it's followed by ""lug,"" but the second ""walm"" gives ""yellow yellow"" because it is immediately followed by another ""walm,"" reducing the repetition count by one.",-7.8370100343379985,164,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the pattern of word-to-color mappings in each example. Here's the relevant data:

1. wif -> red
2. dax -> green
3. zup -> yellow
4. lug -> blue
5. bluf -> yellow (We can infer this from examples 4 and 5 since ""bluf"" maps to ""yellow"" in example 5 where it's the new word and the color ""yellow"" is not attributed to another word in example 4.)

Now, let's analyze the use of ""walm"" across the examples:

- Example 1: ""wif dax zup walm"" outputs three occurrences of ""yellow"" when ""walm"" is introduced.
- Example 2: ""lug dax walm wif"" introduces ""walm"" after ""lug dax,"" which results in two additional occurrences of ""green.""
- Example 3: ""zup dax walm"" introduces ""walm"" after ""zup dax,"" which results in three occurrences of ""green.""
- Example 4: ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" shows us that after introducing ""wif walm,"" we get ""red red red,"" and after ""zup walm,"" there is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- Example 5: ""zup bluf wif walm"" gives us three ""red"" following ""wif walm.""

Considering these, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color of the word that precedes it to repeat three times. In other words, ""walm"" takes the last color mentioned before it and triples its occurrence.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",-9.37692909244,164,walm
"Rule: walm -> multiple repetitions of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. 

In the examples provided, when ""walm"" follows a word, the output color repeats as many times as the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""walm"". For instance:

- In ""wif dax zup walm"", ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and so ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In ""lug dax walm wif"", ""dax"" is associated with green, and ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in ""green green green"".
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", which is red, as in ""dax wif walm lug"", the output is ""red red red"". 

So, ""walm"" indicates repetition of the color that precedes it, typically three times, except in the case it is at the end of a sequence where it repeats twice as observed in ""zup dax walm"" with ""green green green"" and in ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" with ""yellow yellow yellow"".

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word, ""lug,"" we can look for patterns correlating the appearance of ""lug"" with the output in the various examples.

1. In the first example, ""lug"" appears amidst repetitions of ""dax walm,"" which correspond to ""green green,"" and after ""lug"" is introduced, the sequence ""dax walm"" is followed by ""blue green green."" This suggests that ""lug"" changes the pattern, but only temporarily, as it turns ""green"" into ""blue"" for one instance.

2. In the second example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""lug"" could mean ""blue,"" since ""walm"" on its own or following ""dax"" or ""wif"" consistently results in ""green.""

3. The third example has ""lug"" amidst ""wif"" and ""zup,"" which usually translate to ""red"" and ""yellow"" respectively. The presence of ""lug"" doesn't change the color of ""wif"" or ""zup,"" but itself is translated as ""blue.""

4. The fourth example is just the three words in reverse order, and ""lug"" is still ""blue.""

5. In the last example, ""lug"" is between ""dax"" and ""bluf"" (which is closely related to the word ""blue,"" thus we might expect it to mean ""blue"" as well), and the output is ""green blue blue green,"" consistent with ""lug"" meaning ""blue"" even when flanked by different words.

Based on these observations, we can conclude that the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"". It seems to be independent of position in the input string. Here are the rules inferred from the examples:

- ""lug wif"" translates to ""blue red""
- ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red""
- When the order is switched, ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue"" instead of ""blue red""
- ""wif zup bluf"" translates to ""red yellow yellow"", indicating that ""wif"" retains its meaning as ""red"", while other words map to their respective colors (""zup"" to ""yellow"", ""bluf"" to ""yellow"")

Therefore, the rule discerned is:

"wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, regardless of its position in the sequence.",-5.598938991959999,165,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""wif"" acts as a delimiter or a marker that distinguishes words that come before it from those that come after it, while also assigning specific colors to these words according to a rule or set pattern.

The first and third examples are identical:

Input: lug wif
Output: blue red

In both cases, the word preceding ""wif"" (lug) maps to ""blue"" and ""wif"" itself maps to ""red."" The second example:

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red

Here, the word preceding ""wif"" (zup) maps to ""yellow,"" while ""wif"" still maps to ""red."" These examples show that different words before ""wif"" are associated with different colors, but ""wif"" consistently maps to the color ""red.""

In the fourth example:

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue

""wif"" still maps to ""red,"" but this time it precedes another word (lug), which maps to ""blue."" This suggests that the position of ""wif"" in relation to other words affects the color assigned to those words, but ""wif"" itself remains consistently mapped to ""red.""

The fifth example:

Input: wif zup bluf
Output: red yellow yellow

illustrates that ""wif"" comes first and maps to ""red,"" while ""zup"" follows and maps to ""yellow."" The word ""bluf"" is not preceded by ""wif"" in the input but still translates to ""yellow"" in the output, potentially because it follows a word that has already been associated with ""yellow"" (zup).

From these examples, we can deduce:

Rule: ""wif"" -> ""red""

This rule is consistent in every example provided. As for the other words (""lug"" and ""zup""), they seem to have their own rules when they appear before ""wif,"" mapping to ""blue"" and ""yellow,"" respectively. However, when ""wif"" precedes them, or when they are following a word that already has a color mapped to it, they appear to take on the same color as ""wif"" (""red"") or maintain the previous color mapping (""yellow""), respectively. 

This association of ""wif"" with the color ""red"" in output does not explain the entire pattern of color mapping for all positions of ""wif,"" but for the purpose of the task, which is to deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" the consistent rule is ""wif"" -> ""red.""",-5.69623913041,165,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can establish the following mappings:

- ""wif"" maps to ""red""
- ""dax"" maps to ""green""
- ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow"", regardless of its position in the sequence.
- ""lug walm"" maps to a repeated ""blue blue blue"", but since ""lug walm"" is not isolated, we cannot deduce separate meanings for ""lug"" and ""walm"".

Given this information, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",-2.65499340552,165,zup

- Each instance of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- Each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- Each instance of ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- Each instance of ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- For ""walm"", we have only one example where it translates to ""blue blue blue"". Since ""lug"" also translates to ""blue"" but ""walm"" produces it three times, it can imply repetition of ""blue"" for some reason.

There isn't enough information to determine why ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" instead of just one ""blue"". It could be a rule that when ""walm"" follows ""lug"", it repeats the color associated with ""lug"" three times. But without more examples, this is just speculation.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the sets of inputs alongside their corresponding outputs.

1. ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"":
   - Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   - Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   - Observations:
     - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow at both the beginning and end.
     - ""dax"" corresponds to green.
     - ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and when ""lug"" follows ""walm,"" it remains blue.
     - After ""walm,"" the color sequence is blue blue.

2. ""zup dax walm"":
   - Input: zup dax walm
   - Output: yellow green green green
   - Observations:
     - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
     - ""dax"" corresponds to green.
     - After ""walm,"" the sequence is green green.

3. ""dax wif walm"":
   - Input: dax wif walm
   - Output: green red red red
   - Observations:
     - ""dax"" corresponds to green.
     - ""wif"" corresponds to red.
     - After ""walm,"" the sequence is red red.

4. ""zup walm wif"":
   - Input: zup walm wif
   - Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   - Observations:
     - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
     - ""wif"" corresponds to red.
     - After ""walm,"" the sequence is yellow yellow.

5. ""dax zup dax walm"":
   - Input: dax zup dax walm
   - Output: green yellow green green green
   - Observations:
     - ""dax"" corresponds to green and is consistent.
     - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
     - After ""walm,"" the sequence is green green.

Given these observations, it appears that ""walm"" has a function in the sequence rather than a static correlation with a single color. Specifically, ""walm"" seems to cause repetition of the color immediately prior to it, extending until the color changes due to another word. Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color listed immediately before it, for as many instances until a new non-""walm"" color word appears.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color word that appears immediately before it, until a new color word is introduced.",-5.912158709000001,165,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce a rule about the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"".

In every example, the word ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat the color associated with the previous word for a number of times equal to the number of words since ""walm"" was last used or since the start if it's the first occurrence. Here's the breakdown:

1. ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"":
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and since it's the first occurrence, it repeats ""blue"" three times (for three preceding words ""zup dax lug"").
   - After ""walm,"" the pattern continues normally.

2. ""zup dax walm"":
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green.
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and since it is the first occurrence, it repeats ""green"" two times (for two preceding words ""zup dax"").

3. ""dax wif walm"":
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green.
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and again, as the first occurrence, repeats ""red"" two times (for two preceding words ""dax wif"").

4. ""zup walm wif"":
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and repeats ""yellow"" once (as it's the first word before ""walm"").
   - ""wif"" follows ""walm"" and the pattern continues with ""red"".

5. ""dax zup dax walm"":
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green.
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
   - The second ""dax"" also corresponds to green.
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and repeats ""green"" three times (for the three preceding words ""dax zup dax"").

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" takes the color associated with the word directly before it and repeats it for a number of times equal to the number of words since ""walm"" was last used or from the start of the sequence if it is the first occurrence.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be written as:

walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word for a number of times equal to the count of words since ""walm"" last appeared or since the start if it's the first ""walm"" occurrence.",-6.052167945081999,165,walm
"From the provided examples, walm seems to be translated to a series of colors that replicates the color of the word immediately preceding it. 

Here are the observations based on the examples:
1. In the first example, the word before walm is ""lug,"" which translates to blue. After walm, blue is repeated three times.
2. In the second example, the word preceding walm is ""dax,"" which translates to green. Consequently, green is repeated three times after walm.
3. Similarly, in the third example, ""wif"" precedes walm and translates to red. Following walm, red is seen thrice.
4. In the fourth example, ""zup"" comes before walm, translates to yellow, and yellow is repeated thrice after walm.
5. Finally, the fifth example again demonstrates that ""dax"" (green) before walm results in green being repeated three times.

Hence, the rule seems to be:
walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

Rule: If 'x' is the color represented by the word immediately before walm, the output for walm is 'x x x'.",-6.33182409402,165,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the input-output pairs:

1. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

2. Input: zup dax walm
   Output: yellow green green green

3. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red

4. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red

5. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green

By observing the outputs relative to the presence of ""walm"" in the input, it appears that ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat the color that corresponds to the immediately preceding word. Specifically:

- In the first example, ""lug"" translates to blue, and after ""walm,"" blue is repeated.
- In the second example, ""dax"" translates to green, and after ""walm,"" green is repeated three times.
- In the third example, ""wif"" translates to red, and after ""walm,"" red is repeated three times.
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" translates to yellow, and after ""walm,"" yellow is repeated three times.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" translates to green, and after ""walm,"" green is repeated three times.

Based on this pattern, ""walm"" seems to indicate a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately before it. The number of repetitions varies, but could be related to the number of times ""walm"" would be conceptually present in the sequence (indicated by the number of colors repeated).

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word in the sequence, for a number of times that seems contextually specified by the input or could be an arbitrary number following a pattern not fully determined by the given examples (e.g., always three repetitions).",-9.911581242799,165,walm
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word in the sequence.,-10.669263871099998,165,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it can be deduced that ""lug"" means ""repeat the following color's name multiple times."" The number of times the color name is repeated seems to be dependent on the position of ""lug"" in the sequence. 

The rule appears to be as follows:

- If ""lug"" is followed by a color word, it repeats that color word as many times as its position in the sequence. 
- For example, if ""lug"" is the second word in the sequence, the color that follows is repeated twice.
- The word ""walm"" is followed by ""blue"" the same number of times that the ""lug"" is positioned in the sequence.

Considering the examples:
- ""wif dax lug walm"" -> ""red green blue blue blue"": ""lug"" is in the third position, so ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue"": ""lug"" is in the second position, so ""blue"" is repeated three times showing that actual rule might be adding an extra repetition to its positional value.
- ""lug zup"" -> ""blue yellow"": ""lug"" is in the first position, so ""yellow"" appears once.
- ""lug zup dax walm"" -> ""blue yellow green green green"": ""lug"" is in the first position, so ""yellow"" appears once and when ""lug"" is not present, the colors follow normally without repetition.
- ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red"": ""lug"" is in the first position, so ""red"" appears three times indicating that position might not be adding but setting a specific number of repetitions.

However, reviewing the patterns some inconsistencies appear, for example ""dax lug walm"" has ""lug"" in second position but ""blue"" is repeated four times. This could be due to an error in the example or an additional unexplained mechanism. Additionally, ""lug wif walm"" contradicts the earlier identification of repetition by position since ""lug"" is first, but ""red"" is repeated thrice instead of once. 

Thus it is possible that ""lug"" might also be affecting the number of repetitions based on the word that follows it, rather than strictly its own position. Considering this, the rule for ""lug"" may be:

Rule: ""lug"" causes the next color word to be repeated a number of times dependent on a combination of ""lug""'s position and perhaps some property of the following word.",-1.5899808747599997,166,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" indicates a repetition of the color corresponding to the next word in the sequence. For instance:

1. In ""wif dax lug walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and since ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" ""lug walm"" results in three instances of ""blue.""

2. In ""dax lug walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug walm"" produces four instances of ""blue.""

3. In ""lug zup,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""lug zup"" means one instance of ""blue"" followed by an instance of ""yellow.""

4. In ""lug zup dax walm,"" ""lug zup"" means ""blue yellow,"" and following the rule, ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""walm"" is repeated as ""green"" due to ""lug.""

5. In ""lug wif walm,"" ""lug wif"" yields ""blue red,"" and following the rule, ""walm"" is ""red"" and repeated as such.

So, the rule appears to be that ""lug"" causes the color corresponding to the next word to be repeated until a different color (word) or the end of the input is reached.

"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""yellow."" However, the placement of ""bluf"" relative to other words can affect the color assigned to those other words.

Explanation:
- Whenever ""bluf"" appears, the corresponding output is always ""yellow.""
- The presence of ""bluf"" seems to change the color associated with the words immediately before it, potentially based on their relative position.

Let's verify this with the given examples:

1. 
Input: dax zup bluf 
Output: green yellow yellow
Interpretation: ""dax"" becomes green, ""zup"" which is immediately before ""bluf"" becomes yellow.

2. 
Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf 
Output: blue red red green blue blue
Interpretation: ""lug"" becomes blue, ""wif"" before ""bluf"" becomes red, ""dax"" after ""lug"" is green, and the final ""bluf"" again corresponds with yellow, affecting the previous ""lug.""

3. 
Input: dax bluf wif 
Output: green green red
Interpretation: ""dax"" before ""bluf"" still remains green (consistent with the first example), suggesting that ""bluf"" may not be affecting ""dax."" The ""wif"" after ""bluf"" becomes red.

4. 
Input: wif zup bluf lug 
Output: red yellow yellow blue
Interpretation: ""wif"" is red; ""zup"" before ""bluf"" is influenced to become yellow and ""bluf"" itself is yellow; ""lug"" after ""bluf"" is blue.

5.
Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
Interpretation: The first ""zup"" before ""bluf"" turns yellow, ""bluf"" itself is yellow, ""lug"" after ""bluf"" becomes blue, the second ""zup"" remains consistent as yellow, and ""walm"" when preceded by ""zup"" also becomes yellow.

Based on these results, it seems clear that ""bluf"" means yellow. However, there is an inconsistency in the effect on the preceding word. For ""dax,"" the presence of ""bluf"" does not change its color, while for other words like ""zup,"" it turns them to yellow. This may imply a secondary rule that affects the output color of words other than ""wif"" and ""lug,"" but there is not enough information to establish what this rule might be.

bluf -> yellow",-5.619571879091001,166,bluf
"Rule: From the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" assumes the color of the word that precedes it. When bluf follows ""dax,"" the output is green; when it follows ""wif,"" the output is red; when it follows ""lug,"" the output is blue; and when it follows ""zup,"" the output is yellow.

Thus, the rule for bluf seems to be:

bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.",-5.69052001128,166,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following correlations between the input words and their corresponding outputs:

- ""dax"" consistently correlates to ""green.""
- ""lug"" consistently correlates to ""blue.""
- ""wif"" consistently correlates to ""red.""
- ""zup"" consistently correlates to ""yellow.""

Observing the way ""bluf"" affects the outputs, we notice that ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it:

1. In ""dax zup bluf"", ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow,"" which is the same color associated with ""zup.""

2. In ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"", ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" the first time and gives the output ""red,"" which correlates to ""wif."" The second ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and its output is ""blue,"" which correlates to ""lug.""

3. In ""dax bluf wif"", ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green,"" which is the color associated with ""dax.""

4. In ""wif zup bluf lug"", ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow,"" which is the color for ""zup.""

5. In ""zup bluf lug zup walm"", ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and again the output is ""yellow,"" the color for ""zup.""

From these examples, we can deduce the rule:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: ""bluf"" takes the color value of the word that precedes it.
Rule: If a word is followed by ""bluf"", the color output for ""bluf"" will match the color output of the word immediately before it.",-6.71631560126,166,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to correlate the input, which contains the word ""walm,"" with the output, observing the pattern related to the presence of ""walm."" Here is the breakdown:

- ""wif walm"" correlates to ""red red red,"" and ""zup walm"" correlates to ""yellow yellow yellow."" In both cases, ""walm"" results in a tripled color of the word preceding it.
- ""wif walm dax"" yields ""red red red green,"" with ""walm"" again tripling the color of the word before it (wif -> red) and dax providing a single color (green).
- ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" outputs ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue,"" with ""walm"" again tripling the color of the word before it, and the new occurrence of ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in triple blue.
- ""zup wif walm lug"" yields ""yellow red red red blue,"" with ""walm"" once more tripling the color of the word before it (wif -> red).
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" with ""walm"" again tripling the color of the word before it (lug -> blue).

Considering this pattern, it appears that ""walm"" causes the output color to be the same as the color related to the word preceding it, repeated three times. Hence, ""walm"" seems to triple the associated color output of the immediately preceding word.

Rule: walm -> Triple the associated color output of the immediately preceding word.",-1.403088977972,166,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it, three times. In each example, the word following ""walm"" is repeated three times in sequence in the color associated with the preceding word.

Here is the breakdown of the examples given:

1. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red"" (wif is associated with red, so walm repeats it three times)
2. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"" (zup is associated with yellow, so walm repeats it three times)
3. ""wif walm dax"" -> ""red red red green"" (wif is associated with red, so walm repeats red three times; dax follows with green)
4. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"" (lug is associated with blue, so walm repeats it three times)

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",-5.4768628050479995,166,walm
"In order to determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we can look at its occurrences and the corresponding output colors. From the examples:

1. When ""wif walm"" occurs, the output is ""red red red.""
2. When ""zup walm"" occurs, the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
3. When ""lug walm"" occurs, the output is ""blue blue blue.""
4. When ""dax"" is present either before or after ""walm,"" there is a ""green"" included in the output.

It seems that ""walm"" behaves as a repetition operator, with the color of the repetition determined by the word immediately preceding it. The word that comes before ""walm"" dictates the color, and it is repeated three times in the output. The exceptions are when ""dax"" is involved, in which case ""green"" is also added.

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to be repeated three times in the output sequence. If ""dax"" is present, ""green"" is included as well.",-6.349858551740001,166,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the number of repeat colors associated with ""walm"" and other words in each example.

- When ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red.""
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- When ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""

In each case, the color associated with the word just before ""walm"" is repeated three times. The exception is when ""walm"" is followed by another word, as in the first example where ""zup walm walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating ""walm"" does not interrupt or restart the pattern but rather extends it.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word three times. If another ""walm"" follows, it extends the pattern without interruption.",-6.841427006508001,166,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the number of outputs vs. the number of inputs:

1. Input: wif walm zup walm    
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow   
   Here, ""wif"" corresponds to three ""red"" and ""zup"" to three ""yellow"". 

2. Input: zup walm dax     
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green   
   ""zup"" corresponds to three ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to one ""green"".

3. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm     
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue   
   First ""wif"" corresponds to three ""red,"" followed by ""dax"" with ""green,"" then ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" followed by another ""wif"" with ""red,"" and ""lug"" with three ""blue"".

4. Input: zup wif walm lug    
   Output: yellow red red red blue   
   ""zup"" corresponds to one ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to three ""red,"" and ""lug"" to one ""blue"".

5. Input: lug walm   
   Output: blue blue blue   
   ""lug"" corresponds to three ""blue"".

In all cases, the word ""walm"" causes the next word to be output three times. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to multiply the next word's corresponding color output by three.

""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red."" The word ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow."" However, ""dax"" seems to take on the value ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence. 

The last piece of evidence, ""walm"" mapping to ""blue blue blue,"" is not directly related to identifying ""dax,"" but if ""walm"" directly translated to multiple ""blue,"" it would be an irregularity in the pattern since all other inputs map to a single color output.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's examine its use in different contexts:

1. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
   - This implies that ""walm"" following ""zup"" results in three yellows.

2. lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow
   - ""lug wif"" results in blue red.
   - ""dax"" results in green.
   - ""walm"" then results in two more greens followed by a zup, which results in yellow.
   - It seems that ""walm"" could represent a doubling of the preceding color, except it's followed by another command, ""zup"", which has its own output of yellow.

3. zup wif dax walm -> yellow red green green green
   - ""zup"" results in yellow.
   - ""wif"" results in red.
   - ""dax"" results in green.
   - ""walm"" results in two more greens.
   - Again, ""walm"" is doubling the color before it.

4. dax walm wif walm zup -> green green green red red red yellow
   - ""dax"" results in green.
   - The first ""walm"" again doubles the color green.
   - ""wif"" results in red.
   - The second ""walm"" doubles the color red.
   - ""zup"" results in yellow.
   
5. wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   - ""wif"" results in red.
   - ""walm"" triples the preceding color red.
   - ""dax"" then results in green.
   - ""zup"" turns to yellow.
   - ""wif"" again is red.
   - ""lug"" results in blue.
   - The last ""walm"" triples the preceding color blue.

Using these observations, it appears that ""walm"" follows a rule where it repeats the color word that immediately precedes it, and the number of repetitions is the number of times ""walm"" has appeared thus far in the sequence (incrementally, from one additional time up to three additional times based on the examples we have).

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" causes the immediate preceding color to be repeated according to how many times ""walm"" has been used in the sequence; first use: one repetition (doubling the preceding color), second use: two repetitions (tripling the preceding color), and based on the provided examples, it may continue incrementally, but more examples are needed to confirm this pattern beyond the third use.",-1.166240160268,167,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" translates to repeating the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.

- In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, so ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the second and third examples, following ""dax"" which corresponds to green, ""walm"" leads to ""green green green.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax walm"" gives us ""green green green,"" and later ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red.""

Now, applying this to the word ""walm"":

- The second example shows ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" which continues the pattern, with ""dax"" corresponding to ""green.""

"Rule: walm -> ""green"" repeated the number of times as the preceding color word appears in the input. 

For example, in ""dax walm wif walm zup,"" the word 'dax' which corresponds to 'green' appears once before the first 'walm', so the output is 'green' one time. The word 'wif' which corresponds to 'red' appears once before the second 'walm', so the output is 'red' two times (since 'wif' has appeared twice in total in the input by that point).",-11.43891273712,167,walm
"Analyzing the inputs and outputs:

2. zup wif lug wif -> yellow red blue red
3. zup lug zup wif dax -> yellow blue yellow red green
4. lug dax -> blue green
5. dax lug dax lug walm -> green blue green blue blue blue

Let's work out the rule step by step:

- Looking at examples 1 and 4, which are the same, it's clear that ""lug dax"" consistently maps to ""blue green"". This suggests that ""lug"" might represent ""blue"" and ""dax"" might represent ""green"".

- In example 2, ""wif"" seems consistent with ""red"" in all cases it appears. So, if ""wif"" is red, ""zup"" is yellow consistently across examples 2 and 3, and then ""lug"" again appears to be ""blue"" since the sequence ""wif lug wif"" maps to ""red blue red"".

- Example 3 supports our assumptions, as ""lug"" falls in the place of ""blue"" again, ""zup"" correlates with yellow and ""wif"" with red. ""dax"" finishes the sequence with the expected color ""green"".

- Example 5 presents a slightly more complex sequence. Here, we see ""dax lug dax lug"" resulting in ""green blue green blue."" Thus, ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue."" The final word ""walm"" is not found in other examples, but the output is ""blue blue"" suggesting that ""walm"" also maps to the color ""blue.""

Based on these observations, our rule induced from the examples is:

Rule: lug -> blue",-1.7986364232679999,168,lug
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the presence of the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output sequence. Here is how we determine that:

- Input: lug dax -> Output: blue green
  Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green"".

- Input: zup wif lug wif -> Output: yellow red blue red
  Here, ""lug"" is appearing again, corresponding to ""blue"", irrespective of the other words (zup corresponds to yellow and wif corresponds to red).

- Input: zup lug zup wif dax -> Output: yellow blue yellow red green
  Again, ""lug"" stands for ""blue"" amidst other words which correspond to their respective colors.

- Input: lug dax -> Output: blue green
  The same sequence as the first example, further reinforcing that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

- Input: dax lug dax lug walm -> Output: green blue green blue blue blue
  In this example, ""lug"" appears twice and corresponds to ""blue"" both times. Note also that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""walm"" seems to correspond to ""blue blue"".

Let's observe:

1. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" maps to ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"". Here, ""walm"" seems to correspond with a repetition of the word ""yellow"".

2. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"". In this example, ""walm"" precedes ""lug"" and ""wif""; this output again includes a repetition of ""yellow"" (thrice), followed by the color corresponding to ""lug"" (blue). Note that ""wif"" didn't appear until later in the sequence.

3. ""dax walm lug"" gives ""green green green blue"". ""Dax"" maps to ""green"", then ""walm"" seems to multiply the ""green"" before ""lug"" brings in ""blue"".

4. ""zup wif dax walm"" translates to ""yellow red green green green"". ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" and produces additional ""green"" after the initial ""green"" that corresponds to ""dax"".

5. ""zup lug walm"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue blue"". After ""lug,"" which maps to ""blue,"" ""walm"" appears to triple the ""blue"".

In all cases, the presence of ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color word that precedes it. The color repeated is always that of the word immediately before ""walm"".

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word three times.",-0.90753577003,168,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that walm refers to the repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. To be more precise, when ""walm"" follows another word, the color that word represents is repeated multiple times in the output. Here is the breakdown:

1. ""lug zup walm"" results in ""blue yellow yellow yellow"". Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to the color yellow, and it is repeated three times after the initial mention.

2. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"". In this case, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), so yellow is repeated two additional times before moving to the colors for ""lug"" (blue) and ""wif"" (red).

3. ""dax walm lug"" results in ""green green green blue"". ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) here, and green is repeated two more times.

4. ""zup wif dax walm"" leads to ""yellow red green green green"". ""Walm"" follows the word for green (""dax""), thus green is repeated two additional times.

5. ""zup lug walm"" gives us ""yellow blue blue blue"". ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), and blue is repeated three times.

From these examples, the rule for walm can be inferred as:
Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three more times.

Note: The rule specifies three repetitions because, in each case, the color named before ""walm"" appears three additional times after its first occurrence, leading to a total of four instances of that color in the output.",-2.478311400386,168,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze each input and corresponding output sequence to identify patterns.

- In every case where ""walm"" appears, the output color sequence ends with a repetition of the color that occurs immediately after ""lug.""
- The color that follows ""lug"" also directly corresponds to a single color output.

From the examples:
1. ""lug zup walm"" leads to ""blue yellow yellow yellow."" After ""lug"" is ""zup"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" leading to a repetition of ""yellow"" after ""walm.""
2. ""lug wif bluf"" leads to ""blue red red,"" with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red,"" and after ""bluf"" the sequence ends, there's no repetition of ""red"" since ""walm"" is not present.
3. ""walm lug"" leads to ""green blue,"" where ""lug"" directly follows ""walm,"" causing ""blue"" to be the output.
4. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and is repeated after ""walm.""
5. ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" with ""lug"" followed by ""walm,"" causing ""blue"" to be repeated.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word following ""lug"" to be repeated.

Rule: walm -> causes the next color after ""lug"" to be repeated in the output sequence.",-6.227883858939999,168,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we look at the pattern of colored outputs following each input containing ""walm."" We immediately notice that the output color sequence that follows ""walm"" is always a repetition of the color that was translated immediately before ""walm.""

Analyzing the examples:

1. In ""zup bluf lug zup walm,"" ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow."" Therefore, the output following ""walm"" is a repetition of ""yellow.""

2. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" has ""walm"" preceded by ""zup"" again, which means following ""walm"" we get repeated ""yellow"" before the pattern changes with ""lug,"" which precedes ""blue,"" and ""wif,"" which precedes ""red.""

3. ""dax walm lug"" starts with ""dax,"" which translates to ""green."" Since ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is repeated ""green"" until a new word ""lug"" comes in and changes the output to ""blue.""

4. ""zup wif dax walm"" sees ""walm"" following ""dax,"" whose output is ""green,"" hence the output after ""walm"" is repeated ""green.""

5. ""zup lug walm"" has ""walm"" preceded by ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" and thus, the output is repeated ""blue.""

- In the fifth example, ""dax"" is associated with green, and ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" resulting in ""green green.""

Thus, bluf -> the color immediately before it is repeated.",-7.362033539178,169,bluf
"Analyzing the relationship between the input and output given in the examples, we can hypothesize that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color repeated before it. Here's the rationale:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output for ""wif"" is ""red,"" leading to the output ""red red.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" appears after ""zup lug zup lug zup,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Since ""bluf"" comes right after ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is following ""wif,"" whose output is red, so the output for ""bluf"" is ""red red.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red.""
- Finally, in the last example, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" so the output for ""bluf"" is ""green green.""

However, a discrepancy occurs in the last example where ""bluf"" outputs a double green even though it follows different colors. To confirm the hypothesis, we must deduce that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it, but the last example suggests that ""bluf"" may instead always output two greens or that it simply duplicates the color following it, regardless of what preceded it.

Considering we have only one example where ""bluf"" does not follow the initial rule, and given that multiple examples show it following the initial rule, we will stick to the first hypothesis with room for potential exceptions as more data becomes available.

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color given for the word that immediately precedes it.",-8.013063396819998,169,bluf
"Based on the provided input and output sequences, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""bluf.""

In the first example, every occurrence of ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow"" in the output.
In the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by a ""yellow"" in the output.
In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and is followed by a ""red"" in the output. Also, ""wif"" is consistently followed by ""blue"" when not directly followed by ""bluf"" and ""red"" when it is.
In the fourth example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" and both are followed by ""red"" in the output.
In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is at the end, followed by the output ""green.""

Considering these points, it seems that ""bluf"" tends to take on the color value that follows its preceding word in other contexts where ""bluf"" is not present. For instance, ""wif"" usually leads to ""blue"" but results in ""red"" when followed by ""bluf,"" suggesting ""bluf"" changes the result to the subsequent color ""red.""

However, there is an inconsistency in the last example, where ""bluf"" is followed by ""green"" instead. This could imply ""bluf"" adopts a 'default' color or the next color in a sequence when it doesn't follow another color-indicative word.

Here is an attempted rule induction:

Rule:
- ""bluf"" changes the color of its preceding word to the color that would normally follow the preceding word if ""bluf"" were not present.
- If ""bluf"" does not have a clear preceding word rule (such as the word ""dax"" or when at the end of the sequence), it may default to ""green.""

However, without additional examples or rules regarding the input sequence's color pattern, the exact rule governing ""bluf"" cannot be confidently determined. But based on the current information, this is the best tentative rule:

bluf -> Changes the output to the color that follows the preceding keyword in the sequence or defaults to green if no pattern is detected.",-9.64491243612,169,bluf

""zup bluf wif walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow red red red,"" where there is no correspondence for ""bluf,"" making ""zup"" the most recent word with a known color output, which is ""yellow,"" then ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" leading to ""red"" being repeated twice. Since ""bluf"" does not produce a predictable output, it could be inferred that it's either a non-contributing word or an error in the input.

Given the consistency across the examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word two additional times.",-0.9539596085340001,169,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to trigger a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here's the evidence to back this deduction:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"". Since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""walm"" causes the preceding color ""blue"" to be repeated three times.
- ""zup lug walm wif walm"" results in ""yellow blue blue blue red red red"". Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue"") and causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times. ""Walm"" also follows ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red""), resulting in ""red"" being repeated three times.
- ""zup walm lug"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow blue"". Since ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (corresponds to ""yellow""), it causes ""yellow"" to be repeated three times. Since ""lug"" does not have ""walm"" following it, ""blue"" is only mentioned once.
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"". ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""walm"" triggers a repetition of ""green"" three times.
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" gives ""yellow yellow red red red"". ""Bluf"" does not have a corresponding color in the output, indicating it may be a non-operative or a nonsensical filler word. Since ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red""), it causes ""red"" to be repeated three times.

From these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it triggers the repetition of the color corresponding to the word before it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.",-1.11129894116,169,walm
"walm -> The rule seems to be that ""walm"" represents a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it three times. 

Rule:
- When ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""red"" repeated three times.
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""green"" repeated three times.
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" without another word in between that commandeers the color repetition, the output is ""yellow"" repeated twice because ""zup"" by itself yields three ""yellow"" repetitions. Hence, the sequence ""zup walm"" results in two additional ""yellow"" repetitions (for a total of five ""yellows""), which suggests that in this context, ""walm"" does not trigger a full set of three repetitions (unlike other contexts where walm follows immediately after another color word).",-5.0451118999,169,walm

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the output is ""green"" repeated three times (green green green).
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", the output is ""red"" repeated three times (red red red).
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and is not interrupted by another color-associated word, the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times (yellow yellow yellow, which happens in example 3).

"Rule: ""walm"" corresponds to the color that is represented by the word immediately preceding it, repeated three times. If ""walm"" is the first word, there is no color to refer to, and it cannot be defined.

For example:
- ""lug walm"" means ""blue"" is repeated three times since ""lug"" represents ""blue"".
- In ""zup lug walm wif walm"", ""walm"" first repeats ""blue"" three times (from ""lug""), and then repeats ""red"" three times (from ""wif"").
- ""zup walm lug"" only provides ""walm"" with the color ""yellow"" from ""zup"" to repeat since ""lug"" comes after ""walm"".
- ""dax walm"" repeats ""green"" three times as ""dax"" represents ""green"".
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" ends with ""walm"" repeating the color ""red"" from ""wif"".

The word ""wif"" appears before a color and changes the following:

- In the first example, ""wif zup"" corresponds to ""red yellow,"" so ""wif"" changes the color that follows it to red.
- In the second example, ""wif dax"" corresponds to ""red green,"" so in this case, ""wif"" changes ""dax"" to red.

- lug: associated with ""blue"", repeated three times
- wif: associated with ""red"", repeated twice
- zup: associated with ""yellow"", repeated three times
- dax: associated with ""green"", repeated three times

Here's the rule based on the given examples:

Rule: ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the word that comes just before it. The number of repetitions is the same as the number of letters in the word preceding ""walm"".

Hence, ""lug walm"" (3 letters in lug) produces ""blue blue blue"" and ""dax walm"" (3 letters in dax) produces ""green green green"". ""wif walm"" (3 letters in wif) results in ""red red red"", following this rule, but the examples show ""red red"" which doesn't align perfectly. If the example with ""wif"" is not a typo, there may be an additional or alternative rule regarding the word ""wif"", such as that it causes two repetitions instead of repetitions equal to the number of letters in the word.

"Given the examples provided where the nonce word ""bluf"" is used, it appears that ""bluf"" correlates with repeating the color associated with the word that directly precedes it. Here is the breakdown:

- The first example indicates that ""bluf"" following ""lug"" results in ""blue blue"".
- The second example further supports this, as ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and we see ""blue blue"" again.
- In the third and fourth examples, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", and the output is ""red red"".
- Finally, the last example shows ""bluf"" after ""wif"" with the resulting output being ""red red"".

Based on the evidence, we get:

Bluf -> Rule: Repeat the color associated with the word that comes directly before ""bluf"".

This rule fits all the provided examples.",-5.37891322355,171,bluf
"Based on the examples provided and their respective outputs, it seems that ""bluf"" functions as a word that affects the color output, potentially doubling the color that directly follows it in the input. To confirm, let's analyze the patterns:

1. In example one, ""bluf"" is followed by no color but the word ""lug,"" yet two ""blue"" words appear in the output.
2. In example two, the word ""lug"" appears once again after ""bluf,"" and the color ""blue"" is doubled in the output.
3. In example three, ""bluf"" is followed by no other word, and no ""blue"" appears in the output; however, ""red"" is doubled as if ""bluf"" influences the next word 'wif' to be repeated.
4. In example four, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" and ""wif,"" with ""red"" appearing twice in the output suggesting that ""bluf"" has doubled the effect of ""wif.""
5. Finally, in the last example, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" and before ""wif,"" yet ""yellow"" does not double, indicating that ""bluf"" may only affect the words that come after it.

Thus, the rule seems to be:

Rule: When ""bluf"" appears in the input, it doubles the output of the following color-associated word. If there's no color-associated word following ""bluf,"" it doubles the next word that would have a color output.

Using this rule: bluf -> the word that follows ""bluf"" has its associated color output doubled. If no color-associated word follows, the next word with a predictable color output is doubled.",-6.473591904919999,171,bluf
"bluf -> rule. The rule appears to be that the presence of the word ""bluf"" doubles the occurrence of the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" If ""wif"" is present before ""bluf,"" then the output is ""red red."" If ""wif"" is not directly before ""bluf,"" then the color associated with ""bluf"" is not repeated. ""Bluf"" by itself does not have a color associated with it, it only alters the preceding color's occurrence.",-6.935519715800001,171,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can observe that the appearance of the word ""walm"" in an input is always followed by a sequence of ""red"" in the output, regardless of the words that immediately precede or follow it. In all provided examples, ""walm"" results in a repetition of ""red"" in the output equal to the total number of words in the input sequence including ""walm"". For instance:

- In ""zup walm lug wif,"" there are four words, and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue red"" with ""walm"" corresponding to three ""red"" following the ""blue"". 
- In ""dax lug walm,"" there are three words, and the output is ""green blue blue blue"" with ""walm"" corresponding to the triple ""blue"".
- In ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif,"" there are eight words, and the output is ""red red green green red red red blue red"" where ""walm"" corresponds to a sextuple ""red"" followed by ""blue red"", aligning with the count of words in the input. 
- In ""zup wif walm,"" there are three words, and the output is ""yellow red red red.""
- In ""wif walm dax zup,"" there are four words, and the output is ""red red red green yellow"" with ""walm"" corresponding to a triple ""red"".

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" represents a rule where the word ""red"" is repeated in the output for each word in the input sequence including ""walm.""

4. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the output for each input where the word ""walm"" is present and look for patterns.

1. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" is followed by two ""yellow"" and one ""blue"" before ""red"" appears, which might suggest repetition of the preceding color pattern

2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - After ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" we have three ""blue"" in a row, indicating that ""walm"" may be a repetition of the preceding color (blue in this case)

3. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" is followed by ""red,"" which repeats the color of ""wif""
   - This continues the pattern of ""walm"" repeating the last color mentioned before it

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - Again, after ""wif,"" ""walm"" has caused a repetition of ""red""

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and is followed by ""red,"" maintaining the repetition of the color corresponding to the word that precedes it (""wif"")

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word right before ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color that is associated with the word that directly precedes ""walm"".",-6.970658926021999,171,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided. We can compare the input and output strings one by one to infer the underlying rule.

1. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
   Notice that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""
   Since ""walm"" is related to two instances of ""yellow,"" it might mean ""yellow"" as well.

2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Here ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
   Given that ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and corresponds with ""blue,"" it could imply that ""walm"" takes the color of the word before it.

3. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   We see ""wif"" consistently translating to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
   ""Walm"" is followed by ""lug"" and ""wif,"" translating to ""red blue red,"" with ""blue"" being the color of ""lug"" that directly follows ""walm.""

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red.""
   Given that ""walm"" is again followed by ""red,"" it seems to reinforce that ""walm"" takes the color of the next word, which is ""red"" in this case.

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   ""Wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""
   With ""walm"" yielding ""red,"" which is the color corresponding to ""wif"" before ""dax,"" the pattern of ""walm"" taking the color of the word immediately after it is consistent.

Based on these examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it takes the color corresponding to the word immediately following it.

Rule: walm -> Takes the color of the following word.",-9.30425338757,171,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for the patterns associated with the use of the word and the corresponding outputs in various examples.

In the first example:
Input: zup walm lug wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red

Here, the word ""walm"" precedes ""lug wif,"" which corresponds to ""yellow blue red"" in the output.

In the second example:
Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the corresponding output for ""walm"" is ""blue blue.""

In the third example:
Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red

The word ""walm"" precedes ""lug wif,"" which corresponds to ""red blue red"" in the output. The output ""red"" is consistent for ""wif,"" and ""blue"" corresponds to ""lug."" The extra ""red"" might be attributed to ""walm.""

In the fourth example:
Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

""Walm"" follows ""wif"" here, and the corresponding outputs are ""red red red.""

In the fifth example:
Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

In this instance, ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""dax,"" and the corresponding output for ""walm"" is ""red red.""

From these examples, we can infer:

- When ""walm"" is used, we see additional ""red"" in the output.
- The word ""walm"" on its own corresponds to ""red red.""
- The position of ""walm"" in the input does not seem to change its output—adjacent words have their own corresponding colors in the output sequence.

- Example 2: ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green."" The word ""dax"" comes before ""bluf"" and they both correspond to ""green.""

- Example 3: ""wif bluf zup"" corresponds to ""red red yellow."" The word ""wif"" comes before ""bluf"" and they both correspond to ""red.""

- Example 4: ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red blue green."" The word ""zup"" comes before ""bluf"" and both ""zup"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""yellow.""

- Example 5: ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" corresponds to ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue."" The word ""zup"" comes before ""bluf"" with no intervening words and they correspond to ""yellow."" 

From these examples, we can infer the following:

- The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- Additionally, the word ""bluf"" appears to make the previous word output the same color as itself if there are no other words in between.

"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates directly to the color ""yellow"" when following certain words, while it has different colors following other words, suggesting a pattern dependent on the preceding word (the words coming before ""bluf"").

- In the first line, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and translates to ""yellow"". When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" it translates to ""blue.""

- In the third line, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and translates to ""red.""

- In the fourth line, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax,"" and accordingly translates to ""yellow,"" ""red,"" ""blue,"" and ""green.""

- In the fifth line, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and translates to ""yellow"". When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" it again translates to ""blue.""

From this, we can deduce that ""bluf"" itself does not have a fixed meaning, but its meaning is influenced by the word that directly precedes it. Specifically:

- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" ""bluf"" means ""yellow.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" ""bluf"" means ""green.""

4. ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" translates to ""green green red yellow blue"". Following the same translation as before, ""dax"" is ""green"", ""wif"" is ""red"", and ""lug"" is ""blue""; ""bluf"" again seems redundant.

5. ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" translates to ""blue green yellow green green green red"". ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""dax"" is ""green"", ""wif"" is ""red"". The word ""walm"" translates to ""green"" and seems to have a similar function to ""dax"".

From these observations, we can derive the following rule:

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".

Therefore:

zup -> yellow.",-1.1442397483,173,zup
"Based on the given examples, it seems that each word translates to a specific color:

- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" (Note: This is based on the second example; it seems to consistently translate to ""green"" even though it might suggest a relation to the color ""blue"" by similar sounding English words.)
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""walm"" translates to ""green"" (This is inferred from the last example, where ""wif"" is the only new word compared to ""zup lug"" and its translation is known to be ""red"".)

When the word ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow"". The output color for ""zup"" is consistent across all examples and does not seem to depend on the context. Therefore, the most likely meaning is that the word ""zup"" translates directly to the color ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow",-4.48938230806,173,zup
"Based on the patterns observed in the examples, it looks like 'zup' consistently translates to 'yellow'.

"Based on the examples provided, we can infer that the word ""bluf"" represents a rule regarding the color that should follow it.

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" or ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow.""
3. When ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output before and after ""bluf"" is ""blue.""

To construct the general rule for ""bluf,"" let's extract patterns from each scenario:

- ""lug wif bluf"" results in ""blue red red,"" where ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" producing ""red.""
- ""zup lug bluf"" results in ""yellow blue blue,"" where ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" producing ""blue.""
- ""lug bluf zup"" results in ""blue blue yellow,"" where ""bluf"" precedes ""zup,"" producing ""yellow.""
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" results in ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue,"" where ""bluf"" is between ""zup"" and ""lug,"" producing ""yellow blue.""
- ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" results in ""green yellow blue yellow yellow,"" where ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" producing ""yellow.""

The patterns suggest that ""bluf"" takes on a color rule that is dependent on the word that either immediately precedes or follows it. The rule seems to be:

- If ""bluf"" comes after ""lug,"" the color is ""blue.""
- If ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" or ""zup,"" the color is ""yellow,"" regardless of what follows ""bluf.""

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the word immediately preceding it. If ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output color is ""blue."" If ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" or ""zup,"" the output color is ""yellow.""",-1.056365258724,173,bluf
"Based on the examples given and the corresponding inputs and outputs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" For each input word, there seems to be a corresponding color in the output sequence. Let's examine each example:

1. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red."" ""bluf"" is followed by another ""red,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" may mean ""red.""

2. Input: zup lug bluf
   Output: yellow blue blue
   - Here, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" again translates to ""blue."" ""bluf"" is followed by another ""blue,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" could mean ""blue.""

3. Input: lug bluf zup
   Output: blue blue yellow
   - ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" precedes a second ""blue,"" indicating again that ""bluf"" could mean ""blue.""

4. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   - ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""walm"" is ""green,"" and ""dax"" is a new word which correlates to ""green."" Here, ""bluf"" correlates to ""yellow,"" but this might be due to its position after ""zup.""

5. Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
   Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow
   - ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" Here, ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow,"" corresponding to the word ""zup"" that comes just before ""bluf.""

Looking at these examples, it appears that ""bluf"" affects the color word that follows it. More specifically, ""bluf"" repeats the color word that precedes it:

- In examples 1 and 2, ""bluf"" is followed by the color that comes just before it.
- In example 3, ""bluf"" is placed between two instances of ""blue,"" suggesting the same pattern.
- In example 4, ""bluf"" does not repeat ""zup"" (yellow) directly; however, there is a ""yellow"" following ""bluf,"" but there might be a positional aspect influencing this.
- In example 5, ""bluf"" precedes a ""yellow,"" which is the color word before it.

Given this pattern and assuming that the inconsistency in example 4 is due to a positional effect or another rule about sequence, the best deduction for the meaning of ""bluf"" is that it repeats the color word that precedes it.

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare the outputs corresponding to each input:

1. In ""lug wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
2. In ""zup lug bluf,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""
3. In ""lug bluf zup,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""
4. In ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
5. In ""dax zup lug zup bluf,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

It appears that the meaning of ""bluf"" is dependent on its position relative to other words. Let's examine this closer:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" or ""wif,"" the output color is the same as the color corresponding to the word before ""bluf"" (see examples 1, 2, and 3).
- When ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" ""walm,"" or ""dax,"" it seems to take the color corresponding to the last word before ""bluf"" and use the next color in a sequence (see example 4).
- However, when ""bluf"" follows ""zup zup"" (as in example 5), the output color is ""yellow,"" which is not following the color just before it (which would have been blue), suggesting that ""bluf"" in this context repeats the color output that immediately precedes it, creating a sequence of two ""yellow"" outputs. 

These observations suggest that ""bluf"" doesn't have a fixed color meaning but rather represents a rule that dictates that it repeats the color specified before it, unless it is at the end of a sequence followed by different words, in which case it might represent a transition to a new color in a sequence. 

However, more examples would be needed to confirm the pattern for ""bluf"" when followed by words other than ""lug."" The current examples do not provide enough information to deduce a consistent rule in those cases. Given the information available, the tentative rule for ""bluf"" would be:

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color output that precedes it unless it appears at the end of a sequence, in which case it triggers a transition to the next color in a defined sequence.",-9.893455870919999,173,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. The rule seems to be that ""walm"" takes the color coded by the previous word and replicates it in the output three times. Here is the correspondence from the examples provided:

- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue,"" hence ""lug"" codes for ""blue.""
- ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green,"" so ""dax"" codes for ""green.""
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" outputs ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue,"" which suggests ""wif"" codes for ""red,"" ""zup"" codes for ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" does not convert to anything since it does not precede ""walm,"" and ""lug"" still codes for ""blue.""
- ""lug wif dax walm zup"" outputs ""blue red green green green yellow,"" which further supports these color associations, with ""zup"" at the end not affecting the outcome since it does not precede ""walm.""

- ""wif"" is associated with the color red.

Similarly, ""dax"" correlates to green, and ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green.""

"walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word the number of times corresponding to how often the word preceding ""walm"" has been seen before.

Rule: If ""walm"" follows a word, it indicates that the color corresponding to that word should be repeated. The number of repetitions depends on the frequency that the word before ""walm"" has appeared previously in the examples. For instance:

- The first time ""lug"" appears followed by ""walm"", the output is ""blue"" repeated once (three times because it's the first appearance but the repetition count starts from 3 for unknown reasons).
- The second time ""lug"" appears followed by ""walm"", ""blue"" is still the output color, and it is repeated the same number of times (since there is no indication that the count should increase or decrease with further appearances).
- Similarly, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" and outputs ""green"" three times, with no further information available to suggest an increase or decrease in count for additional appearances. 

Applying the rule to a new combination (""wif"" followed by ""walm"") leads to a repetition of ""red"" three times, corresponding to the color mapping for ""wif"".

Evidence for the rule comes from each example:

- Whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the color ""green"" is included in the output.
- If ""dax"" appears multiple times, ""green"" is repeated in the output the same number of times as ""dax"" appears.

Individual examples can be broken down as follows:

- Input: wif dax zup dax

  - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

- Input: dax walm

  - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
  - ""walm"" is not directly translated to a color which suggests that it might either determine the color repetition or have no direct color association; considering the output, it might mean ""repeat the previous color"", which in this case, causes ""green"" to repeat twice more since ""dax"" precedes it.

- Input: zup dax
  Output: yellow green
  - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
  - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

- Input: dax wif dax

Therefore, the consistent interpretation of ""dax"" in this context is that it represents the color ""green"".",-3.000460368908,174,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following:

- When ""dax"" appears by itself, the output is ""green"".
- When ""dax"" is preceded by ""wif"", the output for ""dax"" is ""red"".
- When ""dax"" is preceded by ""zup"", the output for ""dax"" is ""yellow"".
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"", all the outputs are ""green"", but since there is no clear pattern of transformation for ""walm"" alone, its effect on ""dax"" is unclear. It could be inferred that ""walm"" following ""dax"" might maintain the color ""green,"" but this is not definitively shown.
- When ""dax"" follows ""zup"" without any word between them, the output for ""dax"" is ""green"".
- When ""dax"" precedes ""wif"", it does not affect the output for ""dax"", which is ""green"".

Given these observations, it seems ""dax"" generally translates to ""green"" but can change to another color if it is immediately preceded by certain words (e.g., ""wif"" changes it to ""red"", ""zup"" changes it to ""yellow"").

2. ""wif dax zup dax"" maps to ""red green yellow green"". Again, ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"", which reinforces the idea that ""wif"" maps to ""red"".

3. ""dax walm wif walm"" maps to ""green green green red red red"". In this instance, ""walm"" must map to ""red"" considering the repetition of the color in the output.

- In the second instance, ""bluf"" is the only term following ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow."" It seems that ""bluf"" here duplicates the color of the preceding term.
- In the third instance, again, ""bluf"" follows ""lug dax"" and the output ends with ""green green."" Here too, it appears that ""bluf"" generates an additional instance of the color represented by the preceding term, ""dax"" -> ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and generates an additional ""blue"" before the output changes to ""red,"" which corresponds to ""wif.""
- In the last example, ""bluf"" comes in between ""zup"" and ""dax,"" with the output being ""yellow yellow green."" It seems that ""bluf"" duplicates the color of the term before it - in this case, ""yellow"" from ""zup.""

Rule: ""bluf"" duplicates the color of the term that immediately precedes it.

So, bluf -> duplicates the color of the preceding term.",-1.30604163786,174,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following patterns for the words ""lug,"" ""wif,"" ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""bluf"":

1. ""lug"" seems to consistently map to ""blue.""
2. ""wif"" seems to consistently map to ""red.""
3. ""dax"" seems to consistently map to ""green.""
4. ""zup"" seems to consistently map to ""yellow.""

With those mappings in mind, we can consider the word ""bluf"" and look for patterns in its mappings.

- In the first example, the sequence ""lug dax bluf"" maps to ""blue green green,"" where ""bluf"" seems to adopt the color of the word immediately preceding it, which is ""dax"" -> ""green.""
- In the second example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" so here, ""bluf"" takes on the color ""yellow"" from the preceding ""zup.""
- The third example again shows ""lug dax bluf"" translating to ""blue green green,"" with ""bluf"" taking on the color ""green"" from the preceding ""dax.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug bluf wif"" translates to ""blue blue red."" In this case, ""bluf"" directly follows ""lug"" and takes on the color ""blue"" from ""lug.""
- The fifth example, ""zup bluf dax,"" translates to ""yellow yellow green,"" where ""bluf"" takes on the color ""yellow"" from the preceding ""zup.""

From these observations, we can induce the following rule for the nonce word ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Therefore,

"Observing the provided examples and their corresponding outputs, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to a repeating color sequence based on the previous given words.

Let's analyze the instances:

1. lug wif lug dax bluf
   - Output: blue red blue green green
   - Here, ""bluf"" resulted in an additional ""green,"" suggesting that it may be repeating the last color or pattern. 
   
2. zup bluf
   - Output: yellow yellow
   - ""bluf"" results in a repeated ""yellow.""

3. lug dax bluf
   - Output: blue green green
   - ""bluf"" again leads to the last color, ""green,"" repeating once more.

4. lug bluf wif
   - Output: blue blue red
   - In this example, ""bluf"" results in a repetition of ""blue"" which was the color associated with ""lug"" earlier.

5. zup bluf dax
   - Output: yellow yellow green
   - ""bluf"" repeats ""yellow"" before moving on to ""dax,"" which translates to ""green.""

Based on these observations, it appears that the rule for ""bluf"" is that it repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it. However, it's essential to note that we only have a limited dataset. There could be more intricate rules or exceptions outside these examples, but with the given information, this seems to be the pattern.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. The meaning is the repetition of the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""bluf.""

Example translation based on the rule: If an input is ""lug bluf,"" since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" then ""bluf"" would result in a repeated ""blue,"" leading to the output ""blue blue.""",-3.9921062742939997,174,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the rule for walm appears to be related to outputting a series of colors that follow a pattern determined by the preceding words. However, in each case where ""walm"" is present, the output changes and is not immediately obvious based on the surrounding words alone. Therefore, ""walm"" might be enforcing a transformation on the output pattern.

Let's look more closely:

- In the case where ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", the output is a triplet of ""green.""
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" with no other word, the output is a triplet of ""blue.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax lug,"" there are additional colors (""blue blue"") in the output, and when it follows ""lug dax,"" there are additional colors ""yellow yellow.""
- When it is at the end of a sequence such as ""dax walm,"" it results in only three ""green"" colors.

It's difficult to deduce a specific and consistent rule for ""walm"" given there is a bit of variation when ""walm"" appears in different contexts. However, we can observe that the immediate presence of ""walm"" after ""dax"" or ""lug"" seems to lead to a triplet of colors corresponding to the word that came right before it (""dax"" -> green, ""lug"" -> blue).

With the given data, one might assume ""walm"" is a rule to repeat the color associated with the last word before ""walm"" three times. Yet, the example where ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" seems to break this pattern, as it results in ""green green green red"" instead of just repeating greens. Also, the position of ""walm"" seems to modify the outcome when it is in the middle or end of the sequence.

Rule: ""walm"" -> The presence of ""walm"" seems to enforce a repetition rule of the last color associated with the preceding word and might impact subsequent colors, but there is insufficient consistent data to determine an exact rule without further examples.",-5.5864203010799995,174,walm

- ""dax"" results in the color green

- ""wif"" results in the color red
- ""zup"" results in the color yellow

Therefore, ""walm"" likely means to repeat the color sequence given by the preceding words.

Similarly, ""lug"" on its own corresponds to ""blue"", but when followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue"", again showing that the effect of ""walm"" is to add an extra instance of the preceding word's associated color to the output.",-6.9143389606,174,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"". By comparing the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can attempt to induce the rules governing the term ""walm"". Let's examine each example:

1. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
4. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
5. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

Looking at these examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""walm.""

In examples 1 and 3, the word before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" which leads to the output ""green green green."" This corresponds to a threefold repetition of the color green, which is associated with ""dax.""

In example 2, the word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" which leads to the output ""blue blue blue."" This corresponds to a threefold repetition of the color blue, which is associated with ""lug.""

In example 4, the word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" and again the output shows a threefold repetition of the color associated with ""lug,"" which is blue.

In example 5, the word before ""walm"" is ""zup,"" which may be associated with the color yellow, as indicated by the output ""yellow yellow yellow.""

"Based on the given examples, it can be deduced that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times. Each time ""walm"" appears in the input, the preceding color word's output is replicated three times.

Let's break down each example to understand the rule:

1. ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow."" Zup is associated with yellow, and because of walm, it is repeated three times.

2. ""dax walm zup walm"" leads to ""green green green yellow yellow yellow."" Here, dax is associated with green and is followed by walm causing the output of green to be repeated thrice—similarly, zup is associated with yellow and is followed by walm causing the output of yellow to be repeated thrice.

3. ""dax lug walm"" leads to ""green blue blue blue."" Dax is green, but it is not immediately followed by walm, so it's not repeated. Lug is blue and is followed by walm, resulting in blue being outputted three times.

4. ""zup bluf wif walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow red red red."" Zup is yellow but is not followed directly by walm, so it's not repeated. Bluf seems to have no outcome, possibly due to an error. Wif is associated with red and is followed by walm, causing red to be outputted three times.

5. The last example is a repetition of the first, ""zup walm,"" leading to ""yellow yellow yellow"" and confirming the rule derived from the first instance.

Rule: The word ""walm"" triggers the preceding color word's output to be tripled.

Thus:

walm -> causes the preceding color word's output to be repeated three times.",-1.1320121312600002,175,walm

Based on this analysis, here’s the rule:

walm -> Repeats the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

- ""zup walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"".
- ""dax walm zup walm"" yields ""green green green yellow yellow yellow"" because ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" and the next ""zup"" before ""walm"" is associated with ""yellow"".
- ""dax lug walm"" yields ""green blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" changes the color to ""blue"" only for itself, the rule for ""walm"" is still following the color associated with ""dax"".
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" yields ""yellow yellow red red red"" because ""wif"" is associated with ""red"" and ""bluf"" is not associated with a color itself but changes the color for ""wif"" in the output.
- ""zup walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow"" since it follows the same pattern as the first example.",-1.226310373712,175,walm

- 'lug' translates to 'blue'
- 'bluf' translates to 'red'

Now let's apply this pattern to the word 'walm':

- 'zup walm' leads to 'yellow yellow yellow', indicating that 'walm' is repeating the color 'yellow' three times.

- 'dax walm zup walm' gives 'green green green yellow yellow yellow', where 'walm' repeats 'green' three times after 'dax' and 'yellow' three times after 'zup'.

- 'dax lug walm' results in 'green blue blue blue', with 'walm' repeating 'blue' three times after 'lug'.

- 'zup bluf wif walm' leads to 'yellow yellow red red red', but since 'wif' is not translated, we focus on 'bluf walm', where 'walm' repeats 'red' three times after 'bluf'.

Let's analyze the sequences:

1. ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" becomes ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow.""
   - After ""dax"" (green), we get a pattern: red, red, red, followed by different colors (blue, yellow). The repeated word ""walm"" does not affect the pattern, remaining the same color.

2. ""dax zup bluf"" becomes ""green yellow yellow.""
   - ""dax"" is ""green,"" followed by ""yellow"" for both ""zup"" and ""bluf,"" indicating that the first word after ""dax"" and the words following are ""yellow"".

3. ""dax zup"" becomes ""green yellow.""
   - The pattern maintains with ""dax"" as ""green"" followed by ""zup"" translated as ""yellow.""

4. ""dax"" alone is just ""green.""

5. ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" becomes ""green green red yellow green.""

The rule underlying these examples is not entirely clear, but we can deduce:

- ""dax"" is always associated with ""green.""
- After a ""dax,"" there might be a pattern to the colors that is reset once ""dax"" appears again.

Rule:
dax -> green

"Based on the given examples, it seems that each word following ""dax"" is associated with a specific color. Here are the associations we can draw from the examples:

- ""dax"" by itself generates the color ""green.""
- When it's followed by the word ""wif,"" the color ""red"" is produced.
- The word ""zup"" after ""dax"" results in the color ""yellow.""
- When followed by ""bluf,"" the output color is ""green.""

However, looking closely at the examples, we notice that the word ""walm"" produces the color ""yellow,"" but it does so multiple times suggesting repetition in the output for that word only.

Additionally, it seems that the first instance of ""dax"" produces the color ""green,"" and subsequent instances of ""dax"" within the same sequence after other words generate ""green"" again (but not repeating, as seen in the last example).

Taking these observations into account, the generalized rule seems to be:

- Each occurrence of ""dax"" results in ""green.""
- Each occurrence of ""wif"" results in ""red.""
- Each occurrence of ""zup"" results in ""yellow.""
- The first occurrence of ""bluf"" after “dax” results in ""green.""
- The first occurrence of ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in ""yellow,"" and it repeats the ""yellow"" output for each repeat occurrence immediately following it.

Given this pattern, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" as a starting color in a sequence, and it also seems to affect the colors that certain words produce afterward, specifically ""bluf,"" which on its own after ""dax"" also produces ""green,"" and ""walm,"" which produces repeating ""yellows"".

Hence:
dax -> green
wif -> red
zup -> yellow
bluf (after dax) -> green
walm (after dax, with repetition) -> yellow (repeated for each instance of walm)
dax (repeated within sequence) -> green (without repetition)",-6.30781392318,176,dax
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""dax"" is used to signal a color change, with each unique word after ""dax"" corresponding to a specific color. From the provided data, we can infer the following mappings:

- When followed by ""wif,"" the output color is ""red.""
- ""zup"" after ""dax"" produces the color ""yellow.""
- The word ""bluf"" after ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green"" again, but the repetition seems to reset the sequence.
- ""lug"" after ""dax"" results in the color ""blue.""

Each word after ""dax"" keeps generating a sequence of colors until ""dax"" appears again, indicating a fresh start.

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""dax"" acts as a reset command for the color sequence, and it defaults to ""green"" when appearing alone or when it restarts the sequence.

Rule: dax -> Reset command, default color green. When standalone or marking the beginning of a sequence, output ""green."" Each instance of ""dax"" resets any established color pattern, starting again with ""green.""",-7.1707348212,176,dax

The other words also seem to have color associations but are not consistently producing the same color. For example, ""wif"" sometimes corresponds to ""red"" and sometimes to ""green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in two examples but ""blue"" in another. The inconsistencies in these associations suggest that the meaning of other words might be context-dependent or influenced by another rule not evident in the given examples.

"Based on the given examples, walm seems to be associated with repetition of the color that comes before it. When a color word is mentioned before walm, the output repeats that color as many times as the initial letter repeats in the color word. If we examine each instance:

1. ""zup wif walm"" outputs ""yellow red red red"". The word ""wif"" refers to the color red, and since ""walm"" comes after it, and ""w"" repeats three times in ""wwwalm"", red is repeated three times in the output.

2. ""dax lug wif walm"" outputs ""green blue red red red"". The word ""wif"" again refers to the color red and is followed by ""walm"", which causes red to be repeated thrice as in the first example.

3. ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green"". Here, ""dax"" refers to the color green, and ""walm"" follows, which causes green to be outputted thrice, since ""w"" is tripled in ""walm"".

4. ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red"". Again, ""wif"" refers to the color red and is immediately followed by ""walm"", resulting in the red color being repeated thrice due to the triple ""w"" in ""walm"".

Therefore, regardless of the nonce word preceding ""walm"", the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the preceding color to repeat as many times as the first letter of ""walm"" appears in the word.

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the preceding color word in the output the number of times the first letter of ""walm"" (w) is repeated in the nonce word ""walm"". In the examples given, this is three times.",-0.938520189562,176,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer a pattern where ""walm"" generates a sequence of colors, and the color that appears is congruent with the word preceding ""walm.""

For example:
- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red,"" which might imply that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green,"" which might imply that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" one of the colors in the output is ""blue,"" but we cannot be absolutely sure if ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" because it is followed by ""wif walm,"" which we've determined produces ""red"" colors.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before it, repeated three times. If ""walm"" comes after ""zup,"" it produces a sequence starting with ""yellow,"" followed by repeating the color that corresponds to the word ""wif,"" which is ""red"" three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" could be stated as:
""Walm"" -> The word preceding ""walm"" determines the color that will be repeated three times in the output. If there are multiple words before ""walm,"" then the closest word to ""walm"" is the determiner for this repetition. If ""walm"" directly follows ""zup,"" begin with ""yellow"" and then proceed with the color corresponding to the next word.

Using this rule, we can now interpret the color outputs in the examples as follows:
- ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow"" from ""zup,"" and ""red red red"" from ""wif.""
- ""dax lug wif walm"" -> ""green"" from ""dax,"" no explicit output from ""lug,"" and ""red red red"" from ""wif.""
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"" from ""dax.""
- ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red"" from ""wif.""",-2.4425871615199997,176,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" transforms the preceding word into a sequence of the corresponding color. Here's the mapping from the word to the color output we can deduce from the examples:

- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""lug"" -> blue

Furthermore, it appears that the number of times the color is repeated in the output is dependent on the number of words preceding ""walm"". Here's the rule for the number of repetitions:

- If there is one word before ""walm"", the color appears three times.
- If there are two words before ""walm"", the color associated with the word closest to ""walm"" appears three times, while the color associated with the furthest word appears once.
- If ""walm"" follows immediately after a word with no other words in between, the color appears three times.

From these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it takes the nearest preceding word (ignoring any function words like ""wif""), maps it to its corresponding color, and repeats that color a number of times based on the total number of content words before ""walm"".

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" results in the output of a sequence of colors based on the preceding content words. Each content word is mapped to a specific color.

1. In the first example, the sequence ""dax wif lug dax"" translates to ""green red blue green."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"" both times it appears, and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". In this scenario, ""wif"" is the only word that translates to ""red"".

2. In the second input, ""wif"" yields ""green"" right before ""bluf,"" which corresponds to a double ""red,"" but we must note that ""dax"" which we know to translate to ""green"" precedes ""wif"" this time. And the entire sequence before ""wif"" is made up of unique words all translating to ""yellow"".

3. In the third input, ""wif"" occurs before ""walm,"" and both translate to ""red"". Yet this conflicts with the previously implied rule that ""wif"" directly translates to ""red,"" since ""wif"" here results in ""red red red,"" not just a single ""red"".

4. The fourth input also contains ""wif"" at the beginning and in the middle of the sequence. Both occurrences of ""wif"" translate to ""red,"" while ""dax"" and ""zup"" maintain their earlier translations of ""green"" and ""yellow,"" respectively.

5. In the last example, ""wif"" again translates to ""red,"" following ""dax"" (green) and ""bluf"" (green again).

Given the discrepancies and context, a possible rule can be deduced: ""wif"" likely means ""red,"" but context affects the output when ""wif"" appears (as seen in the second and third examples).

In each instance, ""dax"" results in the word ""green.""

Given this pattern across all examples, we can deduce the following rule:
dax -> green.",-1.157690091736,178,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can make some observations regarding the occurrences of the word ""dax"" and its corresponding outputs:

1. When ""dax"" appears, no matter the context, the output color is ""green.""
2. The color output for other words seems consistent regardless of surrounding words. For instance, ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" to ""red.""
3. ""Dax"" does not require context from adjacent words to determine its output, as seen in the pairs ""dax wif"" and ""wif dax"" each independently producing ""green"" and ""red.""

Based on these observations:
Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" regardless of the context.",-6.604014308319999,178,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" can be deduced by examining its context in each input and the corresponding output. Let's analyze each instance of ""dax"" and see what color it maps to.

Example 1:
Input: dax lug wif walm
Output: green blue red red red

Example 2:
Input: dax wif
Output: green red

Example 3:
Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
Output: green red green yellow yellow

Example 4:
Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
Output: red green red red yellow red

Example 5:
Input: wif dax
Output: red green

In every example where ""dax"" appears, the output color is green. 

Therefore, the rule is:
dax -> green",-6.738338851680003,178,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds with the color ""green."" Each time ""dax"" occurs in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

One can also deduce that the other words must correspond to colors as well, based on their repeated positions and corresponding outputs.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green",-7.841998730839999,178,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" each time it is used. It does not seem to be context-dependent; it is consistently translated the same way regardless of its position in the input string or the surrounding words. 

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: dax -> green",-8.76528036278,178,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following rules for the nonce word ""wif"" and its association with colors in the output:

1. Every instance of the input that starts with ""wif"" leads to the output starting with ""red"". This indicates that ""wif"" directly translates to or triggers the color ""red"" in the output.

2. When ""wif"" is followed by other words, each subsequent word seems to be associated with a different color:

- ""walm"" leads to ""green"" (seen in the first and third examples).
- ""lug"" leads to ""blue"" (seen in the second example).
- ""dax"" leads to ""green"" when it follows ""walm"" and ""blue"" (as seen in the third example), but ""green"" when it directly follows ""wif"" (as seen in the first and second examples). It's important to note the difference in the number of ""green"" colors output when ""walm"" precedes ""dax""; this suggests that the occurrence of ""green"" after ""walm"" may be based on the number of syllables in ""walm"" (in this case, one syllable equates to one additional ""green"").
- ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"" (seen in the fourth example).

3. The repetition of a word seems to repeat its associated color in the output. For instance, ""lug"" appears twice in the second example and its color ""blue"" appears twice in the output.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" directly correlates to ""red"" at the start of an output sequence, and any words following it have a corresponding color that repeats as many times as the word occurs in the input.

Rule: wif -> red",-5.022290529794001,178,wif
"Based on the presented examples, it seems that the word 'wif' is associated with a consistent output of 'red' regardless of what other words follow it. In every instance, the presence of 'wif' correlates with the production of the color red first. 

Here is the observed pattern:
- When ""wif"" is combined with ""walm,"" the sequence ""red green"" is produced.
- When ""wif"" is combined with ""lug,"" the sequence ""red blue"" is produced.
- When ""wif"" is combined with ""dax,"" the sequence ""red green"" follows, with an additional 'green' if ""walm"" follows ""dax.""
- When ""wif"" is combined with ""zup,"" the sequence ""red yellow"" follows.
- ""wif"" on its own results in ""red.""

It is not possible to derive an unambiguous meaning of 'wif' itself beyond its consistent association with 'red' as there are no contextual clues that indicate its specific meaning aside from this color correspondence. However, we can create a basic rule:

Rule: The presence of 'wif' in any input sequence results in 'red' as the initial output color.",-5.23543342556,178,wif
"Analyzing the provided examples in order to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" the following conclusions can be drawn:

- Whenever the sequence starts with ""wif,"" the output sequence always starts with red.
- The word ""wif"" does not seem to alter the color sequence that follows. This is indicated by the consistent appearance of other colors corresponding to different words after ""wif.""
- The color red is uniquely tied to the appearance of ""wif"" at the beginning, as it does not occur in the output in association with any other word.

Based on this analysis, the rule can be summarized as follows:

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input sequence, the output sequence begins with the color red. The word ""wif"" itself does not determine any subsequent colors in the output sequence; those colors are determined by the other words that follow.

Wif -> red.",-7.9278879562719995,178,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif"", we should look for patterns associated with it in each provided input-output pair. ""Wif"" appears at the beginning of every input, and ""red"" appears at the beginning of every output. This recurrence, where ""wif"" is followed by different words but consistently translates to ""red"" at the start of the output, suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Thus, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red",-8.828487961846,178,wif
"Rule: wif consistently results in the output ""red.""",-8.8321201502,178,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" we need to look at the patterns in which it appears and the corresponding outputs.

The outputs are sequences of colors. Let's examine the position of ""zup"" in the inputs and the corresponding outputs.

1. zup wif -> yellow red
   Here, ""zup"" precedes ""wif"" which leads to ""yellow"" followed by ""red.""

2. lug walm zup -> blue blue blue yellow
   ""zup"" follows ""lug"" and ""walm"" which are translated to ""blue blue blue"" and then ""yellow"" follows.

3. wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   ""zup"" follows ""wif walm dax"" which corresponds to ""red red red green,"" and after ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" followed by the sequence for ""wif lug walm.""

4. dax zup walm wif walm -> green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   ""zup"" follows ""dax"" which translates to ""green,"" then comes ""yellow,"" and after that, the sequence for ""walm wif walm.""

5. dax walm zup lug -> green green green yellow blue
   ""zup"" is between ""dax walm"" which corresponds to ""green green green"" and ""lug"" which leads to ""blue,"" with ""yellow"" in between these sequences.

From these examples, we can see that whenever ""zup"" is present, ""yellow"" appears in the output precisely at the position where ""zup"" is in the input. Each other input word corresponds to a specific color (""wif"" to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""walm"" to ""green,"" and ""dax"" to ""green""), but ""zup"" aligns with ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow

So the meaning of ""zup"" based on the given examples is that it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output sequence.",-0.9594367030339999,178,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that each nonce word corresponds to a particular color. To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look at the outputs where ""zup"" appears and the color it translates to in each case:

- In the first example, ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red."" Since ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" in other examples as well (""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm""), it is safe to assume ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" Thus, ""zup"" in this context translates to ""yellow.""

- In the second example, ""lug walm zup"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow."" The words ""lug"" and ""walm"" must correspond to ""blue,"" as seen in repeated use in the output. Therefore, ""zup"" here again corresponds to ""yellow.""

- In the third example, ""zup"" appears after ""dax"" and before ""wif,"" translating to ""yellow red."" Since ""wif"" is ""red,"" this further confirms that ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""zup"" is followed by sequences of ""walm wif"" and ""walm lug,"" which each time translate to ""yellow"" followed by sequences of colors. This is consistent with ""walm"" being ""blue"" and ""lug"" being ""blue"" (as from previous observations), and ""wif"" being ""red.""

From these observations, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow

So, ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the given context.",-9.327991284208,178,zup
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow"". Following each instance of ""zup"" is the color word ""yellow"" in the output. It can also be observed that other words correspond to specific colors:

- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- ""dax"" -> ""green""
- ""walm"" -> repetitive coloration of the preceding color (e.g., ""walm"" after ""lug"" generates ""blue blue blue"")

Thus, the rule for ""zup"" is:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",-9.4399266075,178,zup

- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- ""walm"" corresponds to the color red when following ""wif,"" blue otherwise.
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

By examining the sequences in which ""zup"" appears and the corresponding output colors, the rule can be determined. In every instance where ""zup"" is present, the color yellow is outputted in its position.

Thus, the rule is:

zup -> yellow.",-11.235293987599999,178,zup

"Based on the provided examples, bluf seems to correspond to a specific color each time it appears in the input. By comparing the input with its corresponding output, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule for bluf.

Here's the analysis:

- In the first example, the word ""bluf"" results in the color ""green"" appearing twice in the output, suggesting that bluf means ""green.""

- However, in the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by the color ""red."" This suggests that bluf might not always be the same color and its meaning could depend on context, or there might be another word affecting the output.

- The third example has ""bluf"" resulting in ""blue,"" which contradicts the first two instances where it seemed to mean ""green"" and ""red.""

- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""bluf"" once again corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Given that three out of the five examples show bluf corresponding to the color ""blue,"" while the first example deviates from this pattern by indicating ""green"" and the second example indicates ""red,"" let's look for a consistent rule:

Analyzing further, it appears that ""bluf"" may correspond to the color mentioned directly before it or assume the value of the last mentioned color. In the second example, however, this rule is broken.

Let's reassess our observations.

- The direct repetition of a word (like in ""wif wif"" or ""dax wif"") leads to a repetition of the corresponding color in the output.
- The word ""bluf"" consistently follows a color word except in the second example. However, let’s note the sequence of words in the first example ""bluf wif"" results in ""green red,"" while ""wif bluf"" in the second retains the color ""red,"" and not ""green,"" which could indicate that ""bluf"" might mimic the color word before it, except when it comes after ""wif,"" where it remains ""red"".

This leads to a complex rule that might not be entirely consistent based on the provided data. However, a potential rule could be:

Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue,"" except when it immediately follows ""wif,"" in which case the output is ""red."" 

Therefore, the definition could be stated as:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: ""blue,"" except when following ""wif,"" in which case the meaning is ""red.""",-8.447753220786002,178,bluf
"From examining the given examples, we can infer a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"". Let's analyze the outputs in the context of their inputs to deduce the meaning or rule for ""bluf"":

1. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif     
   Output: yellow blue red green green red
   
   In this sequence, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" which results in ""green red"".

2. Input: wif bluf dax walm           
   Output: red red green green green
   
   Here, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" and the output sequence has a repeated color ""green green"".

3. Input: zup lug bluf                
   Output: yellow blue blue
   
   In this case, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and the resulting output is a repeated color ""blue blue"".

4. Input: wif bluf dax lug            
   Output: red red green blue
   
   Once again, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" and the output sequence is ""red green"".

5. Input: dax lug bluf wif            
   Output: green blue blue red
   
   Finally, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and the output has a repeat of the previous color ""blue blue"".

Based on these observations, it seems that the rule for ""bluf"" is to repeat the color that was mentioned immediately before it. Therefore, if ""bluf"" follows a word that corresponds to ""blue,"" the output is ""blue blue."" If it's after ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" it gives ""blue blue."" If it's after ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" it gives ""green green.""

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the word immediately before ""bluf"".",-8.730617611123003,178,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to correspond to the color ""blue."" Here's how we can deduce it:

In the first input, the sequence ""bluf wif"" corresponds to the output ""blue red,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" translates to ""blue,"" since ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" in all the examples.

Continuing this pattern across all examples confirms that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the outputs.

Rule: bluf -> blue",-9.11543882146,178,bluf
Rule: bluf -> blue,-9.73328967802,178,bluf
"From the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each instance, regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> blue.",-9.772818810939999,178,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare each input that contains the word ""walm"" and their corresponding outputs.

1. zup walm dax -> yellow yellow yellow green
2. dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue blue yellow red
3. lug wif walm -> blue red red red
4. lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
5. dax walm zup -> green green green yellow

Looking at the patterns, when ""walm"" is present, the color that follows its appearance in the output sequence is repeated until a different non-""walm"" word is encountered in the input. For example:

- In the first input, ""zup walm dax,"" ""walm"" is followed by three ""yellow,"" and then the word ""dax"" changes the output color to ""green.""
- In the second input, ""dax lug walm zup wif,"" ""walm"" precedes a sequence of ""blue,"" which continues until ""zup,"" which changes the output to ""yellow,"" followed by ""wif,"" changing the output to ""red.""
- In the third input, ""lug wif walm,"" ""walm"" comes after ""lug wif"" and the output shows two ""red,"" which suggests that the effect of ""walm"" is the repetition of ""red.""
- In the fourth input, ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug,"" after the appearance of ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times until ""lug"" is encountered again.
- In the fifth input, ""dax walm zup,"" ""walm"" is again followed by a repetition of ""green"" before ""zup"" changes the color.

From these observations, we can induce that the word ""walm"" causes the next color in the sequence to be repeated until a new non-""walm"" word appears.

Rule: walm -> causes the next word's associated color to be repeated until a new non-""walm"" word appears.",-0.9551574517260001,178,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at each input and its corresponding output to identify patterns.

1. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green

2. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

3. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red

4. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

5. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow

From these examples, we can try to find a correlation between the occurrence of the word ""walm"" and the colors that follow it in the output.

In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by three yellows and a green. In every instance, the word ""walm"" is followed by at least one red color. The word before ""walm"" seems to set the color's sequence. If ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the sequence starts with ""yellow;"" when ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the sequence starts with ""blue;"" and when ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the sequence starts with ""green.""

Considering these patterns, it appears that ""walm"" has the following rule: it causes the next color(s) to repeat the color that is associated with the word that comes immediately before ""walm."" The repetition persists until a new color word appears or terminates at the end of the sequence. The exception is when ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" in which case the color is ""red.""

So, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: Repeat the color associated with the word prior to ""walm"" until a different color word is encountered or until the sequence ends. If ""wif"" is the next word, output is red.",-8.18513193218,178,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can look at the patterns in the input and the corresponding colors in the output. 

Looking at example inputs and outputs to spot patterns related to ""walm"":

1. Input: zup walm dax 
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green 
   
   Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""yellow yellow"".

2. Input: dax lug walm zup wif 
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red 
   
   Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""blue blue yellow"".

3. Input: lug wif walm 
   Output: blue red red red 
   
   Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""red red"".

4. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   
   Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""yellow yellow yellow"".

5. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow

   Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""green green yellow"".

Analyzing the results:

- Every time ""walm"" is used, the color immediately following the occurrence always changes.
- ""walm"" tends to be followed by a repetition of colors—either two or three repetitions—and then a change.

Considering the given examples, the rule seems to center on repetition with the presence of ""walm"" indicating a shift point where the repetition stops and a new sequence begins. The color before ""walm"" is repeated two or three times after it, and then the next color is introduced.

Rule: walm -> a signal to repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word two or three times, followed by a change to a new color.",-8.526443028579001,178,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to analyze the patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

3. Input: lug wif walm

4. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   
5. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow

Let's analyze the patterns:

- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"", the output is ""yellow yellow yellow green"". It seems that ""walm"" in this case repeats the color corresponding to ""zup"", until the last ""walm"", which is followed by the color corresponding to ""dax"".
- In the second input, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""zup"". Here, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and there are two instances of blue before ""walm"". In the output, ""walm"" has the same sequence (blue blue) until it changes to ""yellow"", which corresponds to ""zup"".
- In the third example, ""walm"" is again preceded by ""lug"", resulting in a double ""red"" corresponding to ""wif"", followed by another ""red"" for ""walm"".
- The fourth example has ""lug"" followed by ""bluf"" and then ""dax"", and ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"". The output has yellow corresponding to ""zup"" twice followed by yellow for ""walm"", and there is a blue corresponding to ""lug"" after ""walm"".
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""zup"". The output repeats the color for ""dax"" (green) twice, with a third green for ""walm"", and then yellow for ""zup"".

From this analysis, we observe the following pattern: ""walm"" repeats the output colors of the word that precedes it, except when it is the last or the only word before a change in the pattern (in the examples, this corresponds to when it is followed by a different word). In the last occurrence before a change or the end of the string, ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that follows it.

Rule: walm -> ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it and ends with the color of the word after it, if there is a change in the preceding word's color.

- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- ""walm"" translates to ""red""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""

Considering that the output color for ""zup"" is ""yellow"" regardless of its position within the input sequence or the other words present, the rule seems straightforward:

"Analyzing the examples provided, let's look for patterns that could determine the meaning or rule for the word ""zup"":

1. We can see that every time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears at the corresponding position in the output.
2. Regardless of the position of ""zup"" within the sequence, the output color associated with it is consistently ""yellow.""

Given these observations, we can deduce the following:

zup -> meaning: The word ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" is present in the input, the output at that position should be ""yellow"".",-9.36266553458,179,zup

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",-10.11009259176,179,zup
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns in the input and their corresponding output:

1. In the first example, ""zup wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow red red."" Since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" we can deduce that ""bluf"" might also correspond to ""red.""

2. In the second example, ""lug bluf wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue red."" Here, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" so again ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""

3. In the third example, ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red red green blue blue."" Following the previously deduced meanings, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" Here we see ""bluf"" after a ""wif"" results in ""red,"" and ""bluf"" after a ""lug"" results in ""blue.""

4. In the fourth example, ""zup lug bluf wif"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue red."" We can confirm that ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red."" Here, ""bluf"" following ""lug"" is ""blue"" again.

5. In the fifth example, ""wif dax bluf"" corresponds to ""red green green."" We have ""wif"" as ""red,"" ""dax"" as ""green."" Following the pattern, ""bluf"" would be ""green"" after ""dax.""

From these examples, it seems ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it. If it comes after ""zup,"" it would be ""yellow""; after ""lug,"" it would be ""blue""; after ""wif,"" it would be ""red""; and after ""dax,"" it would be ""green.""

Rule: bluf -> the color of the word that precedes it.",-0.7578812556440001,179,bluf
"Analyzing the examples given, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" Let's look at each example:

1. ""zup wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow red red.""
2. ""lug bluf wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue red.""
3. ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red red green blue blue.""
4. ""zup lug bluf wif"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue red.""
5. ""wif dax bluf"" corresponds to ""red green green.""

From these examples, we see that after the word ""bluf,"" the color red follows twice, except in the third example, which has an additional word ""dax"" and ""lug"" interrupting the sequence. Therefore, it appears that ""bluf"" might be related to the color red, and its effect is reflected in the output sequence. However, there's also a repeated pattern where the instance of ""bluf"" in the input leads to a repeat of the color word that directly precedes it in the output. Let's apply this pattern to the examples:

1. In ""zup wif bluf,"" ""wif"" translates to red and is followed by ""bluf,"" which becomes ""red red.""
2. In ""lug bluf wif,"" ""lug"" translates to blue and so does ""bluf,"" followed by ""wif"" as red.
3. In ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf,"" it gets a bit more complex, but the pattern holds if we consider ""bluf"" is representing the repetition of the color preceding it: ""blue"" before it is mentioned again and ""blue"" after it, then ""red"" is repeated following ""wif,"" breaking with ""dax"" introducing green, ""lug"" is blue, and finally ""bluf"" repeats the preceding blue again.
4. In ""zup lug bluf wif,"" ""lug"" is blue, so ""bluf"" here is a repetition resulting in ""blue blue,"" followed by ""wif"" as red.
5. In ""wif dax bluf,"" ""dax"" is green, and ""bluf"" following it results in green again.

So the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" causes the color that precedes it to be repeated in the output sequence.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color word that directly precedes it in the output sequence.",-0.975487662826,179,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to examine its use across different examples and look for patterns.

In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to a double ""red"" in the sequence. Similarly, in the second example, ""bluf"" corresponds to a double ""blue."" In the third example, ""bluf"" is used twice and both times it corresponds to the color mentioned before it being used twice: ""blue blue."" In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" resulting in ""blue blue."" Lastly, in the fifth example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""green green.""

From these observations, we can infer that ""bluf"" results in the duplication of the color word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color word that precedes it.",-7.206856182464,179,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color in the output. Each time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the color that follows in the output is not consistent, suggesting that ""bluf"" does not correspond to a fixed color itself but rather to a rule about the color that should follow.

Looking closely at the examples:

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red
Notice how ""red"" repeats after ""bluf"".

Input: lug bluf wif
Output: blue blue red
Here, ""blue"" appears twice after the occurrence of ""bluf"".

Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
Output: blue red red green blue blue
After the first ""bluf"", ""red"" is repeated, and after the second ""bluf"", ""blue"" (which corresponds to ""lug"") is repeated.

Input: zup lug bluf wif
Output: yellow blue blue red
Again, ""blue"" follows ""lug"", and after ""bluf"", the color ""blue"" repeats.

Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green
Here, ""green"" repeats after ""bluf"".

From these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" signals that the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it should be repeated in the output sequence.

So, the rule for ""bluf"" is:

"Analyzing the given examples, I observe that the output for ""walm"" is a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here's how the rule applies in each case:

1. In ""wif dax lug walm,"" the word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue. Thus, ""walm"" repeats the color blue three times as ""blue blue blue.""
2. In ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, so ""walm"" outputs ""green"" three times as ""green green green.""
3. In ""dax walm wif walm zup,"" first ""dax"" is associated with green, which leads to ""walm"" outputting ""green"" three times. Then, ""wif"" before the second ""walm"" is associated with red, so ""walm"" outputs ""red"" three times. ""zup"" at the end corresponds to yellow.
4. In ""dax lug walm,"" the preceding word ""lug"" corresponds to blue, thus ""walm"" outputs ""blue"" three times.
5. In ""zup bluf wif walm,"" ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with red, which makes the output of ""walm"" ""red"" three times.

Rule: walm -> meaning. Meaning is that ""walm"" outputs the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times in sequence.",-9.33972375512,179,walm
"Based on the context provided by the input and output examples, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. Here is the analysis leading to this conclusion:

- Input: lug dax lug
  Output: blue green blue
  ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" both times it appears.

- Input: zup dax lug
  Output: yellow green blue
  Here ""lug"" is at the end and corresponds to ""blue"".

- Input: wif zup lug wif
  Output: red yellow blue red
  The word ""lug"" appears third in the sequence and translates to ""blue"".

- Input: dax lug zup dax

  In this sequence, ""lug"" is the second word and is represented as ""blue"".

- Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif

"Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning of the word ""dax"" by looking at the input and corresponding output patterns:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""dax"", the output is ""red green"".
- When ""dax"" precedes ""wif"" and ""walm"", the output starts with ""green"" and is followed by a series of ""red"".
- When ""zup"" precedes ""wif"" and ""dax walm"", the output is ""yellow red"" followed by a series of ""green"".
- When ""dax"" precedes ""lug"" and is followed by ""wif"", the output is ""green blue red"".
- When ""dax"" precedes ""lug"" and is followed by another ""dax"", the output is ""green"" followed by ""blue"" then another ""green"".

From these patterns, we can surmise the following rules about ""dax"":
- ""dax"" when appearing first in the input seems to translate to ""green"" in the output.
- The output color sequence is influenced by the position of ""dax"" and the words around it—whether ""dax"" directly follows another word or is followed by another word (for example, ""lug"").

Given that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" every time it appears in the input, regardless of its position, we can deduce a rule for ""dax"":

Rule: dax -> green

However, it is important to note that additional context or examples might be needed to fully understand if there are any more complex rules or exceptions governing the use of the word ""dax"".",-2.4367703501,180,dax

- ""wif"" consistently leads to the output ""red.""
- ""walm"" consistently leads to the output ""red red red,"" implying a repetition of ""red"" three times.
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the sole instance it appears.
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in each instance it appears.
- ""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green"" as it consistently leads to this output.

We can adopt a rule for this set of examples:

dax -> green

The context suggests the outputs are color translations of the nonce words, in which ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""

- ""dax"" means ""green.""
- Other words in the input correspond to their respective colors in the output, with ""walm"" indicating a repetition of the color ""red"" three times.",-4.361009393928,180,dax

- Input: zup wif dax walm -> Output: yellow red green green green
- Input: dax lug wif -> Output: green blue red

"Analyzing the examples, let's try to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""dax"".

3. Input: zup wif dax walm -> Output: yellow red green green green
4. Input: dax lug wif -> Output: green blue red
5. Input: dax lug dax -> Output: green blue green

From the first and second examples, we may infer that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", as switching their order does not affect the corresponding output colors (""red green"" to ""green red"").

In the third example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", but ""walm"" must depend on the preceding word. When preceded by ""wif dax"" or ""dax,"" it results in multiple ""green,"" but without ""dax,"" there is no output for ""walm.""

In the fourth example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and having ""dax"" before ""wif"" leads to the same colors as when ""dax"" follows ""wif,"" confirming ""dax -> green"" and ""wif -> red.""

The fifth example, ""dax lug dax,"" gives us ""green blue green,"" supporting the idea that ""dax"" stands for ""green"" and ""lug"" for ""blue.""

Based on the examples given, the recurring and consistent response to ""dax"" in various positions in the input (whether it is at the start, middle, or end of a sequence) is ""green."" There seems to be no contextual change in meaning based on the position or surrounding words.

In every instance where ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output the same number of times as ""dax"" appears in the input. Seeing this consistent one-to-one relationship between ""dax"" and ""green"" across all examples, we can induce the following rule:

"Based on the provided examples, I can deduce the following:

5. In the fifth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""zup"" and later followed by ""wif,"" yielding outputs ""red"" and ""yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" yields double ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" yields ""green.""

4. wif dax zup walm -> red green yellow yellow yellow (There are three colors 'wif', 'dax', and 'zup', meaning red, green, and yellow respectively. Since 'zup' comes last, 'walm' repeated the last mentioned color 'yellow' three times after 'red' and 'green'.)

3. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and the pattern continues with ""walm"" repeating ""red"" four times as it is the second color word before ""walm.""

4. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   Rule: The words ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup"" translate to ""red,"" ""green,"" and ""yellow,"" respectively. ""Walm"" repeats ""yellow,"" the last color word, five times, corresponding to the total count of different color words before it (three in this case).

5. Input: zup wif dax walm lug

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red
- ""Lug"" correlates with ""blue."" The pattern of ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" again results in ""red red red.""

Input: wif dax zup walm
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
- ""Dax"" correlates with ""green."" This suggests that the word just before ""walm"" is repeated one more time than it would have been alone.

Input: zup wif dax walm lug
Output: yellow red green green green blue
- This input introduces ""lug"" at the end, correlating with ""blue."" Once again, the instance of the word just prior to ""walm"" (""dax"" correlating with ""green"") is repeated one more time than usual.

Using these observations, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color corresponding to the word that appears just before ""walm"" in the input to be repeated one additional time in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the output color corresponding to the word just before ""walm"" by one extra instance.",-6.165442076039,180,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the output color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it. Let's break it down:

1. In ""zup walm"", ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" leads to it being repeated three times.
2. In ""zup wif walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to red, so with ""walm"" it is repeated four times.
3. In ""lug wif walm"", again, ""wif"" is red and is repeated three times with ""walm"".
4. In ""wif dax zup walm"", ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and it is repeated three times because of ""walm"".
5. Finally, in ""zup wif dax walm lug"", ""dax"" corresponds to green, and with ""walm"", it is repeated three times followed by ""lug"", which corresponds to blue.

The rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately before it three times. However, it's worth noting there's an inconsistency in the second example (""zup wif walm"") where ""walm"" leads to four repetitions instead of three.

Given this anomaly, a more cautious interpretation would be that ""walm"" leads to multiple repetitions of the color corresponding to the word immediately before it, with an unspecified rule governing the exact number of repetitions.

Therefore, the best deduction, accounting for the anomaly is:

walm -> meaning: Causes the preceding color word's corresponding color to be repeated multiple times. The exact number of repetitions may vary according to an unspecified rule or may follow the majority pattern of three repetitions, with the second example being an exception or error.

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" is a repeater for the color word that comes directly before it in the sequence. Here's the analysis for each input:

1. dax lug bluf wif → green blue blue red

2. wif bluf → red red
   ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"", and the output for ""wif"" is ""red"". In the output, ""red"" is repeated.

3. zup wif bluf → yellow red red

5. zup dax bluf → yellow green green
   ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"", and the output for ""dax"" is ""green"". In the output, ""green"" is repeated.

Therefore, the rule induced here is:

- In the second and fourth examples, ""wif"" corresponds to red, followed by ""bluf,"" which leads to another red. Again, ""bluf"" duplicates the color red.
- In the third example, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" and the same red-red pattern occurs.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, followed by ""bluf,"" resulting in another green.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word preceding it.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the examples provided. Initially, we can note the corresponding colors for each word, other than ""walm,"" and look for consistency in their appearances:

- ""wif"" appears to consistently correspond to ""red.""
- ""dax"" appears to consistently correspond to ""green.""
- ""zup"" appears to consistently correspond to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue"" but requires further scrutiny.

Now, let’s analyze the context in which ""walm"" appears and its corresponding output color:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""red red red green yellow.""
2. In the second example, it is preceded by ""yellow"" and followed by ""yellow yellow blue red.""
3. In the third example, it is preceded by ""green"" and followed by ""green red.""
4. In the fourth example, it comes after ""blue blue yellow blue"" and is followed by nothing.
5. In the fifth example, it is followed by ""red red red.""

From these examples, we notice that after ""walm"" is used, the following word (if there's one) corresponds to ""red"" except when ""walm"" is the last word, in which case there is no color output after it. This observation suggests that ""walm"" may require examining the word after it to determine its corresponding color. Given the information and looking through the examples:

- When ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" (which corresponds to ""green""), the output is ""red red red green"".
- When ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red""), the output is ""red red red red"".
- When ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue""), the output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue"".

It seems that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color corresponding to the word following ""walm."" However, it doesn't do this when it's the last word, implying that its effect is contingent on it being followed by another word.

With these observations, we can propose the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color output corresponding to the next word (if there is one) three times before the actual color for the following word is presented. When ""walm"" is the last word, it adds no color output.",-5.0629793023,182,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we can examine the output colors corresponding to the input positions where ""walm"" appears. Let's analyze each instance where ""walm"" is used:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup

   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and both outputs are red.

2. Input: zup walm lug wif

The word ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and both lead to ""yellow.""

3. Input: dax walm wif  
Output: green green green red  
The word ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and both lead to ""green.""

4. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug  
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue  
The word ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and both ""lug"" and ""walm"" result in ""blue.""

5. Input: dax wif walm  
Output: green red red red  
The word ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and both result in ""red.""

From these examples, it looks like ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" seems to be that it takes on the same color output as the previous word.

Rule: walm -> duplicates the color associated with the preceding word.",-7.417305588217998,182,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided.

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
2. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
3. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
4. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
5. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red

From the inputs and corresponding outputs, we can infer the following:

- The first word in the input seems to determine the color assigned to ""walm"" in the output.
- In (1), (3), and (5), ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and ""dax,"" which both produce red, and in the output, ""walm"" is also red.
- In (2), ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which produces yellow, and the output for ""walm"" is also yellow.
- In (4), ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which has not appeared preceding ""walm"" in any other example, but looking at other occurrences of ""lug,"" it seems to correspond to the color blue. However, in (4), ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"" which results in ""blue,"" then by ""zup,"" and then by ""lug"" which then results in ""yellow"" and then ""blue,"" breaking the pattern. Therefore, the color transition before ""walm"" is not based on ""lug.""
- It's important to note that the color after ""walm"" contradicts the color before it in (4). That could suggest that ""walm"" affects the subsequent word based on its previous word, but there is not enough consistent evidence to confirm this, as the pattern remains consistent in other examples irrespective of ""walm""'s presence.
  
With this in mind, let's formulate the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: The word ""walm"" takes the color of the word immediately preceding it in the input sequence, except when the word sequence disrupts the pattern, which may result in a conflicting output. However, since there is insufficient data to predict the behavior when the pattern is disrupted by contrasting words, ""walm"" can only be reliably determined to repeat the color of the preceding word.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" is:
walm -> ""walm"" takes the color of the preceding word in the input sequence.",-8.959858080070001,182,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the output corresponding to the placement of ""walm"" in the input examples.

- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output color for ""walm"" is red.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output color for ""walm"" is yellow.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output color for ""walm"" is green.
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output color for ""walm"" is blue.

It seems that the color for ""walm"" is dependent on the word that immediately precedes it. Based on this data, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" takes on the output color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it.

- When ""wif"" is combined with other terms, such as ""lug dax wif,"" the output expands, but ""red"" is still part of that sequence.
- Regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input sequence (""wif lug walm"" or ""zup bluf wif walm""), ""red"" consistently appears in the output.

""Walm"" does not correspond to a known color word in the examples, but as ""wif"" is the last known color word, ""bluf"" could be interpreted to continue duplicating ""red"" for ""walm,"" resulting in ""red red red.""

- In the first example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output is ""red red"".  
- In the second example, ""dax"" and ""wif"" precede ""bluf"" and ""zup"", respectively, and the output is ""green green"" for ""dax bluf"" and ""red"" for ""wif"".
- In the third example, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output is ""yellow yellow"".

- In the second example, ""wif"" follows ""bluf,"" so the output again includes ""red red.""
- The third and fourth examples show that ""lug"" following ""bluf"" results in ""blue blue"" in the output (although ""blue"" is shortened to ""blue"" in the third output, likely due to a typing error).
- The fifth example demonstrates that ""wif"" following ""bluf"" produces ""red red,"" and since ""walm"" doesn't have a corresponding color before it, it seems to repeat the color associated with ""wif"".

It seems that ""bluf"" outputs the color that corresponds to the word that either immediately follows it or the last color mentioned previously (which is red in Input 3). Let's establish the rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" outputs the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately after it; if ""bluf"" is the last word, it outputs the color corresponding to the last word before it that has an established color association.",-9.793422365014,184,bluf
"By examining the translations provided in the inputs and outputs, we can look for patterns that denote the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" The word ""bluf"" and its corresponding output across the examples are:

1. bluf -> blue
2. bluf -> yellow
3. bluf -> red
4. bluf -> blue
5. bluf -> green

Based on this information, it seems that ""bluf"" does not have a consistent one-to-one translation to a color. Therefore, we need to ascertain the rule that determines its output.

A potential rule can be inferred by looking at ""bluf""'s position relative to other words and their associated colors:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which is translated to ""blue"" and results in ""bluf"" also being translated to ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup lug zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow blue yellow,"" leading to the translation of ""bluf"" to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is at the end after ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red,"" making ""bluf"" translate to ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif lug"" which translates to ""red blue,"" and ""bluf"" translates to ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which is associated with ""green,"" and thus ""bluf"" is also translated to ""green.""

It appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word preceding it when it is a color word. If the pattern holds, ""bluf"" should be translated into the color corresponding to the immediately preceding color-associated word. However, there is an exception when there are combinations of color-associated words before ""bluf"" (as seen in the second example): in this case, ""bluf"" was translated into the color of the pair ""zup lug"" (yellow blue) and not individually as ""yellow"" (""zup"") or ""blue"" (""lug""). This suggests that the rule may be more complex and may involve evaluating pairs or sequences of color-associated words preceding ""bluf.""

Given the complexity observed and the need for more data to establish a more reliable rule, the deduced rule, which still may be incorrect or incomplete, is as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the color of the preceding color-associated word, taking into account potential influence from sequences of color-associated words.",-9.932872915607998,184,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at each input and its corresponding output to identify any patterns:

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   
2. Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
   Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow
   
3. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   
4. Input: wif lug bluf wif zup
   Output: red blue blue red yellow

5. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green

From the output in each of these examples, it is clear that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue. In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" which becomes ""blue"" and then ""green blue."" In the second example, ""bluf"" is at the end of the input and the output ends with ""yellow,"" which based on other examples seems to match ""zup,"" suggesting that the last ""yellow"" is not representing ""bluf."" The other examples further support that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue.

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each instance of the word ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the color ""blue"" in the output. Therefore, we can infer the following:

Rule: bluf -> blue",-12.8518984633,184,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the relationship between the input and the output sequences. Each example has a corresponding color output, sometimes with repetitions. Let's inspect the patterns:

1. Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, the color in the output is repeated three times.
2. ""walm"" doesn't seem to have a fixed color associated with it. Instead, its color depends on the word before it:
    - After ""wif,"" the color is red (Example 1: ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"").
    - After ""lug,"" the color is blue (Example 2: ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""; Example 4: ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"").
    - After ""dax,"" the color is green (Example 3: ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"").
    - Its placement after ""wif"" and ""lug,"" regardless of their position relative to ""dax,"" still results in the same color (Example 4 and Example 5).

Let's compile the rule for ""walm"" based on these observations:

Rule:
walm -> The meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times. If the preceding word is ""wif,"" the color is red. If it is ""lug,"" the color is blue. If it is ""dax,"" the color is green.",-5.548098225547999,184,walm
"To figure out the meaning of ""walm,"" we will look for patterns that correspond to the examples provided. We note the following patterns for other words:

1. wif -> red
2. zup -> yellow
3. dax -> green
4. bluf -> blue
5. lug -> blue (consistent with the instances of ""bluf"")

Now let's examine the occurrences of ""walm"" in the examples:

- In the first example, ""walm"" results in three outputs of yellow immediately following three outputs of red, which corresponds to ""wif."" Since ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" it seems that ""walm"" might be a repetition of the color associated with the word before it. In this case, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which is yellow, hence the output of yellow.

- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the output is three blues, which corresponds to ""lug"" before it.

- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is three greens, which corresponds to ""dax.""

- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""walm"" repeats the color of the word preceding it (blue in the fourth example after ""lug,"" red in the fifth after ""wif"").

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, for a total of three times.

Rule: walm -> The meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",-5.657383748799999,184,walm
"From the provided examples, we can induce that the output involves repeating a color some number of times. By examining the relationship between the inputs and outputs, it appears that the word preceding ""walm"" determines the color that is repeated, and the word ""walm"" itself seems to indicate the action of repeating that color three times.

Let's analyze each example to identify the pattern:

1. Input: wif walm zup walm   
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow

   Here, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" and the output is ""red"" repeated three times. Then ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in ""yellow"" repeated three times.

2. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug   
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

   The color ""blue"" is being repeated three times after ""bluf"" and ""walm"". ""Dax"" converts to ""green"", but since ""lug"" follows, it does not trigger repetition specific to ""walm"".

3. Input: dax walm   
   Output: green green green

   ""Dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" which results in ""green"" repeated three times.

4. Input: wif dax lug walm   
   Output: red green blue blue blue

   ""Wif"" produces a single ""red,"" ""dax"" a single ""green,"" and ""lug"" followed by ""walm"" results in ""blue"" repeated three times.

5. Input: dax lug wif walm   
   Output: green blue red red red

   ""Dax"" gives us a single green, ""lug"" gives us a single blue, and ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" results in ""red"" repeated three times.

From this analysis, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be outputted three times in succession. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" should be:

Rule: Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",-5.972628426150001,184,walm
"Rule: walm -> meaning. The meaning of walm appears to be ""repeat the color of the word that precedes walm three times.""

In each example given, the output repeats the color associated with the word immediately before walm three times:

- In ""wif walm"", wif is associated with red, so walm leads to ""red red red"".
- In ""lug walm"", lug is associated with blue, so walm leads to ""blue blue blue"".
- In ""dax walm"", dax is associated with green, so walm leads to ""green green green"".

Thus, the rule seems to be that walm causes the last color to be repeated three times.",-6.65024523292,184,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word walm seems to correspond to a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here's the breakdown:

- ""bluf lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue."" Bluf corresponds to blue, and walm repeats the color blue twice.
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green."" Dax corresponds to green, and walm repeats the color green twice.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word three times in total (including the original instance of the color).

- Other words like ""dax"" and ""bluf"" result in different colors when in different positions relative to other words (e.g., ""dax"" outputs ""green"" in the first and second examples but ""red"" when following ""wif walm"" in the second example).
- The word ""lug,"" on the other hand, consistently corresponds to ""blue"" regardless of its position.

- When ""zup"" follows ""dax,"" the output corresponding to ""dax"" is ""green,"" but ""dax's"" output can also be ""green"" when it is not preceded by ""zup"" (as seen in the fifth input). This suggests that the output for ""dax"" is not dependent on ""zup.""

Hence, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow,"" regardless of its position or the surrounding words. There are no apparent additional conditions affecting this transformation based on the examples provided.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",-0.9471121360940001,185,zup
"To find the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" we must look for patterns in the examples that include the word and its corresponding output color. Let's investigate the provided examples:

We'll check each instance of 'zup' and its corresponding output to deduce its meaning:

- In the second input, 'zup' is the first word and the corresponding output is yellow.
- In the third input, 'zup' is the last word and the corresponding output is yellow.
- In the fourth input, 'zup' appears twice, once after 'lug' (blue) and once before 'dax' (green), in both cases the output for 'zup' is yellow.
- Finally, in the fifth input, 'zup' appears twice, at the beginning and the end of a sequence where the following and preceding words are 'dax' (green), the output for 'zup' again is yellow.

2. When ""zup"" stands alone or begins the sequence, it consistently outputs ""yellow.""
3. When ""zup"" appears before ""lug,"" ""lug"" outputs ""blue,"" and ""zup"" before it outputs ""yellow.""
4. When ""zup"" is between words, for instance between ""dax"" and ""walm,"" it does not affect the colors assigned to those words, as ""dax"" remains ""green"" and ""walm"" remains ""yellow"" in outputs.

"Observing the pattern in the examples given, it appears that ""bluf"" is translated each time as either ""blue"" or ""yellow"". The decision rule isn't immediately obvious from the examples provided, as ""bluf"" doesn't consistently translate to the same color. However, examining the output more closely, it seems that ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" when preceded by ""lug"" and to ""yellow"" when preceded by any other word.

Let's test this hypothesis with the given examples:

1. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - Here, each occurrence of ""bluf"" after ""lug"" is translated to ""blue"".

2. Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
   - The ""bluf"" is not preceded by ""lug"", so it is translated to ""yellow"".

3. Input: zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow yellow blue
   - ""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" (not ""lug""), so it is ""yellow"".

4. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif

5. Input: dax bluf wif zup

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we must look at each example and see how the output changes when ""walm"" is present. 

- In the first example, ""wif walm dax"" corresponds to ""red red red green."" If we ignore ""walm"" for a moment, we can guess that ""wif"" might correspond to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" since the Output changes color when ""dax"" is introduced.
  
- The second example, ""zup walm,"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" There's no immediate way to deduce what ""zup"" or ""walm"" translates to based on this Output alone, but we can note that the presence of ""walm"" doesn't change the color.

- The third example, ""dax wif walm,"" outputs ""green red red red."" This is similar to our guess from the first example, where ""wif"" potentially corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" but then it all changes to red when ""walm"" is introduced.

- The fourth example shows that both ""lug"" and ""walm"" are present with ""bluf"" and ""wif."" The Output is ""blue blue red blue red red red blue."" Knowing that ""wif"" may correspond to ""red,"" and assuming that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" the addition of ""walm"" again changes the Output to reds after it appears.

- Finally, the fifth example, ""wif walm,"" and the Output is ""red red red,"" reinforces our earlier guess that ""wif"" is ""red.""

4. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> blue blue red blue red red red blue
5. wif walm -> red red red

In all instances, the presence of the word ""walm"" results in a sequence of red being output, and it is always the color before the last position.

The word ""walm"" does not have a constant color associated with it; rather, it seems to repeat the color of the previous word before the last position in the sequence. To further support this, looking at the input ""dax wif walm,"" we see that ""walm"" takes the color red, which is associated with ""wif"" immediately before it.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be: repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" for each position before the last one in the output sequence.

4. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug

5. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

From the examples, we can see that the presence of ""walm"" is associated with a sequence of ""red"" in the output, with the exception of whenever ""dax"" follows ""walm,"" which corresponds to ""green"". More specifically:

Example 1: ""wif walm dax"" has three reds followed by a green.
Example 3: ""dax wif walm"" ends with three reds (but starts with a green because ""dax"" comes before ""walm"").

In the other examples, ""walm"" is not immediately followed by ""dax"" and the output is entirely red, except for instances of ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" and ""zup"" which have their own color associations (blue, blue, and yellow respectively).

Based on the color output pattern and the placement of ""walm,"" it seems that the rule for ""walm"" is generating three reds. Therefore:

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the input-output pairs. By comparing the examples, we can try to identify the correspondence between the inputs and the outputs:

- In the first and third inputs, the word ""walm"" corresponds to the sequence ""red red red.""
- In the second and fifth inputs, which only have two words, ""walm"" by itself corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the fourth input, the sequence ""wif walm"" still corresponds to ""red red red.""

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm,"" when paired with ""wif,"" leads to the output ""red red red."" However, when ""walm"" appears without the word ""wif,"" it corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow."" Therefore, the word ""wif"" seems to modify the output related to ""walm."" Additionally, it seems that ""walm"" contributes a triple repetition of a color in the output regardless of what precedes it.

Given the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of a color thrice, and the exact color can be influenced by the presence of another word such as ""wif.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the following color three times. The color is red when preceded by ""wif,"" yellow otherwise.",-7.0199035392799995,185,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to identify patterns that correlate with changes in the output.

Let's analyze the patterns in each input-output pair:

1. Input: wif walm dax | Output: red red red green
2. Input: zup walm | Output: yellow yellow yellow
3. Input: dax wif walm | Output: green red red red
4. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug | Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
5. Input: wif walm | Output: red red red

Some initial observations:

- Every occurrence of ""walm"" results in three reds in the output sequence.
- The color that comes after these reds in the output seems to relate to the word following ""walm"" in the input (with ""dax"" corresponding to green in examples 1 and 3, and no word after ""walm"" in examples 2 and 5 leading to no color after the three reds).
- Therefore, ""lug"" doesn't lead to a color change when it comes after ""walm"" (as per example 4), possibly because it also already occurred earlier in the input sequence.

Based on these observations,
Rule: The word ""walm"" corresponds to three consecutive ""red"" outputs, regardless of the surrounding words in the input. The pattern for words after ""walm"" seems to resume as normal unless that word has already been used in the input sequence, in which case it does not generate a new color output.

Therefore:
walm -> three reds in output.",-7.596002664960001,185,walm
"Based on the examples provided, ""lug"" seems to consistently translate to the color ""blue"". Each instance of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the position or surrounding words.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we can compare the position of ""dax"" in each input to its corresponding color in the output:

1. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
2. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
3. lug dax lug -> blue green blue
4. zup walm dax lug -> yellow yellow yellow green blue
5. lug dax wif lug -> blue green red blue

Looking at the colors associated with ""dax,"" we can see that it is ""green"" in every instance where it appears. To confirm any positional rules, let’s look at contexts where ""dax"" is not present and see if green occurs:

1. None of the inputs without ""dax"" result in a green output.
2. ""Green"" appears only when ""dax"" is in the input.

Hence, it appears that the presence of ""dax"" directly corresponds to the output color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green",-1.158096660612,186,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we must look for patterns in the example inputs and outputs. Here's an analysis based on the given data:

1. When ""dax"" is in the first position (Example 1), the first output is green.
   - Input: dax bluf zup
   - Output: green green yellow

2. When ""dax"" is in the last position (Example 2), the last output is green.
   - Input: zup bluf dax
   - Output: yellow yellow green

3. ""Dax"" appears in the second position in Example 3, and the second output is green.
   - Input: lug dax lug
   - Output: blue green blue

4. ""Dax"" appears in the last position before ""lug"" in Example 4, and the respective output is green followed by blue corresponding to ""lug.""
   - Input: zup walm dax lug
   - Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

5. ""Dax"" is again in the second position in Example 5 and the output is green.
   - Input: lug dax wif lug
   - Output: blue green red blue

From these examples, we can deduce that the position of ""dax"" does not change its corresponding output color. Regardless of its position in the input sequence, ""dax"" consistently translates to green in the output sequence.

Rule: dax -> green",-4.802244514606,186,dax

"Based on the provided examples, each instance where ""wif"" is used, it corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. There is no context given that would imply that ""wif"" has a meaning that changes based on other factors. It is consistent and static regardless of its position or the other words around it. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" is:

Rule: wif -> red",-8.410352638380001,186,wif
"Based on the input-output pairs provided, I will deduce the meaning of the word ""zup"":

1. In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow.""
2. The second and third examples reinforce that ""zup"" alone corresponds to ""yellow.""
3. The fourth example indicates that ""zup"" still corresponds to ""yellow"" even when surrounded by other words.
4. The fifth example also supports that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input.

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow

When looking at the position of 'bluf' in the input and the corresponding color in the output, it appears that 'bluf' consistently maps to the color 'red'.

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word is consistently mapped to a specific color. Let's try to determine the rule for ""bluf"":

Input: dax lug wif bluf -> Output: green blue red red
In this example, ""bluf"" correlates with the second ""red"" in the output.

Input: zup bluf wif dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow red green blue

Input: wif bluf dax -> Output: red red green
In this example, ""bluf"" correlates with the second ""red"" in the output.

Input: wif bluf lug zup -> Output: red red blue yellow
In this example, ""bluf"" correlates with the second ""red"" in the output.

Input: zup dax bluf -> Output: yellow green green

From these examples, we can deduce that ""bluf"" is associated with the color that is mentioned or mapped immediately before it in the sequence. To generalize:

Rule: bluf -> the color that immediately precedes it in the sequence.",-6.478762602870999,186,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" is translated into the color ""red"" in the output each time it appears. The other words in the input (""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""wif,"" ""zup"") correspond to different colors (""green,"" ""blue,"" ""red,"" ""yellow"" respectively), but ""bluf"" consistently maps to ""red."" Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> red",-6.60628015856,186,bluf
"The examples provided suggest that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color in the output. By looking at the consistent pairings of nonce words and colors, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of ""bluf.""

Looking at the output color that appears every time ""bluf"" is in the input:

- In the first example, when ""bluf"" is present, the corresponding output is ""red.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is also matched with ""red.""
- The same goes for the third and fourth examples.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is again followed by ""green"" in the output, but this does not appear to match with the previous patterns, suggesting there might be more to the rule than a simple one-to-one correspondence.

Based on the above examples, it's clear that ""bluf"" is most consistently followed by ""red."" However, there is an inconsistency in the fifth example, which could imply that the color following ""bluf"" is affected by other words in the sequence.

To address this inconsistency and create a general rule, let's consider the position of ""bluf"" within the input sequence:

- When ""bluf"" precedes ""dax,"" the corresponding output color is ""green"" rather than ""red.""
- In all other cases where ""bluf"" does not precede ""dax,"" the corresponding output color is ""red.""

Given this observation, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: When ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output color is ""green."" When ""bluf"" is followed by any other word or is at the end of the sequence, the output color is ""red.""

Therefore, we could define ""bluf"" as follows:

bluf -> meaning: If ""bluf"" precedes ""dax,"" it means ""green."" In all other contexts, ""bluf"" means ""red.""",-9.84301768008,186,bluf
Rule: bluf -> red.,-10.697331554780002,186,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can examine how its presence affects the color output in each example.

- In all examples where ""walm"" is present, the word immediately after ""walm"" results in ""blue.""
- When ""walm"" is the second word in the sequence, such as ""lug walm dax,"" the word before ""walm"" also results in ""blue.""
- When ""walm"" is the first word in the sequence, such as ""walm zup,"" the word after ""walm"" results in ""red.""
- However, in the last example, ""lug walm"" does not yield ""blue red,"" so the previous conclusion isn't universally applicable.

Let's try a different approach:

- The output is composed of four colors: red, green, blue, and yellow.
- Every sequence containing ""walm"" has ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""walm.""
- When ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" ""red"" follows the first ""blue"" in the output.
- When ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" ""green"" follows the last ""blue"" in the output.
- “lug” always translates to ""blue,"" whether ""walm"" is in the sequence or not.

Based on these observations, the word ""walm"" seems to cause the following word to take on the color ""blue,"" but also maintains the original color attributed to that word if it were alone, as noted in the case with ""zup"" and ""dax,"" where ""red"" and ""green"" appear respectively following ""blue."" 

If we apply this logic consistently:

- ""wif walm zup"" outputs ""red red red yellow"" because ""wif"" is not followed by ""walm."" If ""walm"" turns the following word into ""blue"" and keeps the original color, ""zup"" would be ""yellow,"" but here it's ""red yellow.""
- ""dax lug walm"" outputs ""green blue blue blue"" because ""dax"" is not followed by ""walm,"" ""lug"" always translates to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes the following sequence to be ""blue"" as well.
- ""lug zup walm lug"" outputs ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"" because ""lug"" always translates to ""blue,"" ""zup"" turns into ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" keeps ""lug"" as ""yellow"" while following it by ""blue.""
- ""zup lug walm"" outputs ""yellow blue blue blue"" because ""zup"" is not followed by ""walm,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" follows by ""blue.""
- ""lug walm dax"" outputs ""blue blue blue green"" because ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" turns ""dax"" into ""blue"" first, followed by its original color of ""green.""

It appears the rule is as follows:
Rule: ""walm"" changes the following word to ""blue"" in the output sequence, but also keeps the original color of that word where applicable, thus potentially creating two colors in the sequence whenever ""walm"" precedes another word.

Hence, the rule interpretation:
walm -> changes following word's output to ""blue"" while also including the word's own color if not ""blue"" already.",-1.19695939128,186,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let us analyze the patterns where the word appears and the corresponding outputs.

- In every instance where ""walm"" appears, the output color that follows is ""blue.""
- The word ""walm"" does not correspond to a single color, but rather to a repeating pattern based on the word that immediately precedes it.
- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red yellow,"" where ""red"" corresponds to ""wif"" and ""yellow"" could be the output for ""walm"" in this case.
- When ""lug,"" ""dax,"" or ""zup"" precede ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue,"" corresponding to the repeated color for the preceding word, and ""blue"" is the last color, indicating a rule rather than a direct translation.
- If ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the pattern consists of three ""blue"" followed by another ""blue"" for ""walm.""
- If ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output pattern ends with ""green,"" but since ""dax"" alone translates to ""green,"" it's likely that ""walm"" maintains the preceding pattern with a ""blue"" ending.
- If ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the pattern is three ""yellow"" followed by ""blue"" for ""walm.""
- The pattern of colors before ""walm"" always ends with a ""blue"" regardless of the color that represents the word before ""walm.""

Given these observations, the meaning of ""walm"" seems to depend on the word before it, and it results in the output pattern ending with a ""blue."" Therefore, the general rule induction for ""walm"" appears to be that it induces a repetition of the color corresponding to the preceding word followed by a ""blue"" at the end.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color pattern and end with ""blue"".",-5.96825295078,186,walm
"To deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word walm, let's look closely at the correspondence between the input and the output colors in the examples provided:

2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

4. Input: zup lug walm

5. Input: lug walm dax

Let's identify patterns for each word other than ""walm"" that appears in the input:

- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow""

Now, we examine the occurrences of ""walm"":

- In examples 1 and 4, ""walm"" appears after different words (""wif"" and ""lug"" respectively), yet the output color is the same (""blue"").
- In examples 2, 3, and 5, ""walm"" directly follows ""lug"", with ""lug"" having a consistent color output of ""blue"" before ""walm"". Each time, the output color for ""walm"" is also ""blue"".

- When preceded by ""wif,"" the output color is ""red.""
- When preceded by ""dax"" or ""lug,"" the output color is ""blue.""
- When ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output color supercedes the typical ""blue"" associated with ""lug,"" maintaining ""blue"" for ""walm"" itself.

Analyzing the patterns, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to the output color ""blue,"" except when preceded by the word ""wif."" Therefore, the position of ""walm"" in the sequence and the words around it affects the output color, suggesting a contextual meaning that is primarily blue but can change to red under specific circumstances.

- In the second example, ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue,"" where again ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

- In the third example, the pattern of ""wif dax lug dax"" becomes ""red green blue green,"" and the ""lug"" is positioned between two instances of ""dax"" (green) and follows ""wif"" (red), indicating ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

- In the fourth example, the sequence ""lug wif bluf lug wif"" becomes ""blue red red blue red,"" which confirms ""lug"" as ""blue"" since ""bluf,"" representing ""red,"" is adjacent to it, but does not match it.

2. Input: dax zup bluf

   (As before, ""dax"" is green)

5. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow green yellow green red red
   (Each ""dax"" is consistently green)

None of the other words (bluf, zup, lug, wif) consistently correspond with green in the outputs. This indicates that the word ""dax"" has a direct and consistent association to the color green.

- Other words in the input correspond to different colors (e.g., ""bluf"" -> yellow, ""zup"" -> yellow, ""lug"" -> blue, ""wif"" -> red).
- The colors do not change based on position; rather, each word is paired with a unique color.

- In ""wif bluf"", ""wif"" corresponds to red, and then ""bluf"" also corresponds to red.
- In ""dax zup lug bluf"", ""lug"" before ""bluf"" corresponds to blue, so ""bluf"" also corresponds to blue.

However, in the example of ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"", the color before ""bluf"" is ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow, but the output for ""bluf"" is yellow instead of blue. This might indicate a deviation from the previous observations where ""bluf"" mimicked the color represented by the word immediately before it. To consolidate this pattern, let's examine whether ""bluf"" always copies the color of the word right before it or whether it might be related to a specific word's color regardless of position.

2. In ""wif bluf zup"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", so ""bluf"" becomes ""red"".
3. In ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"", the last color word before ""bluf"" is ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"", so ""bluf"" becomes ""yellow"".
4. In ""dax zup lug bluf"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", so ""bluf"" becomes ""blue"".
5. In ""zup bluf wif"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", so ""bluf"" becomes ""yellow"" as the default as well since it's the same as the preceding color.

Thus, the rule: bluf -> the color word that precedes it; default to ""yellow"" if none precedes it.",-8.06731236464,187,bluf

"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to correspond to a repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it. To confirm this, let's look at each input and output pair:

1. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" corresponds to ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue."" Here, ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the output has ""yellow"" repeated twice after ""zup.""

2. ""dax lug walm"" corresponds to ""green blue blue blue."" In this case, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and the output has ""blue"" repeated three times.

3. ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue."" Similarly, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which is ""blue,"" and the output has ""blue"" repeated three times.

4. ""zup lug walm wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue blue red red red."" Here, the first ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (""blue""), and we get ""blue"" repeated three times. The second ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (""red""), and we get ""red"" repeated three times.

5. Again, ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue,"" where ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (""blue""), resulting in ""blue"" repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the color word immediately before it to be repeated three times in the output.",-0.9452888352140001,187,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should analyze the patterns in which it occurs in each given input and the corresponding output. Examining each example:

1. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   Analysis: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" After ""zup,"" there is an occurrence of ""walm,"" which resulted in three repetitions of ""yellow."" We can guess that ""walm"" may indicate a repetition of the color that comes immediately before it.

2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Analysis: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" After ""lug,"" ""walm"" is used, and it results in two more ""blue."" This reinforces our initial guess that ""walm"" indicates repetition.

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Analysis: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""lug,"" ""walm"" is used and it is followed by two more ""blue."" This is consistent with the repetition pattern observed so far.

4. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   Analysis: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is followed by one blue from ""lug,"" then ""walm"" appears and leads to two additional ""blue."" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and it is followed by ""walm,"" which leads to two more ""red."" ""Walm"" consistently triggers a repetition of the preceding color.

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Analysis: This example is identical to the third one and supports the pattern found.

Rule: 
walm -> The word ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word two additional times.",-6.205570740471,187,walm
"Based on the examples provided, there appears to be a consistent pattern wherein the word ""walm"" results in three repeated color outputs. Specifically, the repetition of the first mentioned color after the word ""walm"". Here is the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" After ""walm,"" there are three ""yellow"" outputs.
- In the second example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue."" After ""walm,"" there are three ""blue"" outputs.
- The third example is similar to the second, with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue,"" followed by three ""blue"" outputs after ""walm.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"" is before ""walm,"" and after ""walm,"" three ""red"" outputs are observed.
- The last example is identical to the second and third, with ""walm"" following ""lug"" (blue) and resulting in three ""blue"" outputs.

Therefore, it seems that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it, and that repetition consists of three instances of that color.

Rule: walm -> meaning. The nonce word ""walm"" is a command to repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.",-6.4549966608239995,187,walm
"Based on the provided examples, ""walm"" seems to represent a repetition rule, specifically repeating the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it three times. In each example, the word after ""lug"" or ""wif"" and prior to ""walm"" dictates the color that is to be repeated.

Here is the deduction based on the inputs and outputs:

- In the first input, ""wif lug zup walm wif lug,"" the word ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and after ""walm,"" we see ""yellow"" repeated three times. 
- In the second input, ""dax lug walm,"" the word ""dax"" is associated with green, and after ""walm,"" we see ""blue"" (from ""lug"") repeated three times.
- In the third and the fifth inputs, ""lug walm"" simply has ""blue"" repeated three times, consistent with the rule.
- In the fourth input, ""zup lug walm wif walm,"" the word ""walm"" first follows ""lug,"" so ""blue"" is repeated three times; then ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" resulting in ""red"" repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule is:

2. Whenever ""walm"" is input, the output contains ""blue"".
3. ""zup"" correlates with the output ""yellow"".
4. ""wif"" correlates with the output ""red"".

By examining where ""lug"" appears and what color it translates to in the outputs, it's noticeable that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence or the other words present.

- The appearance of ""lug"" does not seem to be affected by its position in the sequence; irrespective of where it appears, it translates to ""blue.""
- When ""lug"" is paired with other nonce words such as ""dax"" and ""walm,"" those words also translate to colors, but the word ""lug"" consistently correlates with the color ""blue.""

1. lug walm wif bluf

   This suggests that ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color of the word that came before it, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" (despite its similarity to ""blue"") also corresponds to red.

2. wif walm dax zup wif lug walm

   ""wif"" starts this sequence with red, followed by the repetition rule for ""walm."" ""dax"" gives green, ""zup"" gives yellow, ""wif"" again gives red, ""lug"" as previously thought is blue, and ""walm"" again follows the repetition rule. 

3. lug wif walm

   ""lug"" is blue, ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" is a red repeating from ""wif.""

4. lug wif zup wif walm

   Consistent with the previous examples, ""lug"" is blue, ""wif"" is red, ""zup"" is yellow, ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" continues the red.

5. zup dax wif
   - Output: yellow green red
   ""zup"" is yellow, ""dax"" is green, and ""wif"" is red.

The term ""wif"" consistently leads to the output ""red"" across all examples, regardless of position or other words present. Therefore, we can deduce that:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.",-8.747453468523,188,wif
"To determine the meaning of 'wif,' let's carefully examine the input and corresponding output across all examples given.

- The presence of 'lug' leads to an output of 'blue.'
- The presence of 'walm' leads to an output of 'blue blue blue' or 'red red red.'
- The presence of 'zup' leads to an output of 'yellow.'
- The presence of 'dax' leads to an output of 'green.'

Now, we need to specifically focus on 'wif' and how it impacts the output:

1. When 'wif' is in the presence of 'lug walm,' it leads to an output sequence that starts with 'blue red.' When 'walm' is by itself, it produces 'blue blue blue' or 'red red red.' Thus, 'wif' seems to change the 'blue blue blue' into 'red red red' for 'walm.'

2. When 'wif' stands alone (e.g., 'wif walm' after 'lug'), it produces 'red red red.' This is consistent with the change observed above.

3. When 'wif' precedes 'zup,' the output is 'yellow red,' instead of just 'yellow,' suggesting that 'wif' contributes an extra 'red.'

4. When 'zif' is the first word in the input sequence ('wif walm dax zup'), it produces 'red red red,' which again is consistent with its effect observed in other examples.

So, we can draw a conclusion about 'wif' based on these observations:

Rule: 'wif' translates to the color 'red.' When adjacent to 'walm,' 'wif' seems to modify the output sequence that 'walm' alone would produce, changing it from 'blue blue blue' to 'red red red.' When 'wif' occurs independently of 'walm,' it still produces 'red' in the output.

Therefore, the rule for 'wif' is:

wif -> red",-8.830771124572,188,wif
"Considering the consistent usage of ""wif"" in different contexts throughout the examples, we can make the following observations:

1. ""wif"" is always followed by the output ""red.""
2. ""wif"" does not seem to be affected by the words that precede or follow it – it retains its output independent of its position in the input string.
3. Other words like ""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup"" consistently correspond to the colors ""blue,"" ""blue,"" ""green,"" and ""yellow,"" respectively.
4. The presence of ""wif"" does not alter the output associated with these other words.

- The position of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to the position of ""red"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow,-8.0277951883,188,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look closer at the input-output pairs to identify any patterns:

1. ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup"" (first input-output pair).
2. ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" when preceded by ""wif"" (second and fifth input-output pairs).
3. ""bluf"" corresponds to a repeated color when it occurs twice in the input (fifth input-output pair).

There are insufficient examples to make a definitive rule about ""bluf"" without more context. However, if we focus on the repetition of ""bluf"" in the last example and its resulting output, we can see that there might be a pattern of ""bluf"" taking on the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

With this in mind, let's see if this rule fits all the examples:

- Input: zup bluf dax
  Output: yellow yellow green
  Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" thus ""bluf"" becomes ""yellow"" here.

- Input: wif bluf lug zup
  Output: red red blue yellow
  Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" thus ""bluf"" becomes ""red"" here.

- Input: zup wif bluf zup
  Output: yellow red red yellow
  Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" thus ""bluf"" becomes ""red"" here.

- Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
  Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
  Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" thus ""bluf"" becomes ""yellow"" here.

- Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
  Output: red red green green red red red blue red
  Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" thus the first ""bluf"" becomes ""red""; the second instance of ""bluf"" is preceded immediately by ""dax,"" but this breaks the rule since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and the second ""bluf"" in the sequence does not. It seems to maintain the previous color unless the word immediately before it signifies a color, in which case it defaults to ""red.""

From the above, we can induce that the rule may be as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" generally takes on the color indicated by the word immediately preceding it, unless that word is a new color indicator starting with ""dax"" in which case ""bluf"" maintains the color before the new indicator.

However, due to the limited data, this rule may not be exhaustive or entirely accurate. It's the best we can do with the given examples, and more data would be needed to refine this rule further.",-5.005025748776,188,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the examples and their corresponding outputs to identify patterns:

Example 1:
Input: zup bluf dax
Output: yellow yellow green

Example 2:
Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow

Example 3:
Input: zup wif bluf zup
Output: yellow red red yellow

Example 4:
Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

Example 5:
Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red

Analysis:
- In Example 1, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""dax,"" with the output colors being yellow and green respectively.
- In Example 2, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""lug,"" with the output colors being red and blue respectively.
- In Example 3, ""bluf"" is between two occurrences of ""wif"" with the outputs before and after ""bluf"" both being red.
- In Example 4, ""bluf"" is again preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""lug,"" and the outputs related to ""zup"" and ""lug"" are yellow and blue respectively.
- In Example 5, ""bluf"" appears twice: once it is preceded and followed by different words (""wif"" and ""dax,"" with outputs red and green respectively), and the second time it is preceded and followed by the same word (""wif"" with output red).

From these observations, it seems that when ""bluf"" is preceded by the same word as it is followed by, the output color for ""bluf"" is red, as seen in Examples 3 and 5 (the second occurrence of ""bluf"" in Example 5). This suggests that part of the rule for ""bluf"" might be related to repeating or adjacent words.

However, this rule is not sufficient to account for all the outputs, as ""bluf"" also generates the output color yellow when preceded by ""zup"" (Example 1 and 4) and blue when followed by ""lug"" (Example 2 and 4). This indicates that the color output for ""bluf"" may also involve the color outputs of the preceding and following words.

Given this information, we can hypothesize the following rules based on the available data:

Rule: When ""bluf"" is preceded by the same word as it is followed by, its output color is red. When ""bluf"" is preceded by a word that outputs the color yellow or followed by a word that outputs the color blue, ""bluf"" outputs yellow and blue respectively. In the remaining case (preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""dax""), ""bluf"" outputs green.

Therefore, bluf -> the color output changes depending on the context; specifically:
1. If preceded and followed by the same word, output red.
2. If preceded by a word associated with yellow, output yellow.
3. If followed by a word associated with blue, output blue.
4. In other contexts, as seen in Example 5's first ""bluf"" instance, output green. However, this final bullet point is speculative and would need more examples to verify patterns when ""bluf"" doesn't meet the criteria of the first three rules.",-7.5013159585330005,188,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" can be associated with the color ""yellow"" when it follows the word ""zup,"" and with the color ""red"" when it follows the word ""wif."" However, the third example also shows ""bluf"" following ""wif"" yet returning ""red"" instead of ""yellow."" Meanwhile, in the fifth example, when ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""dax,"" the color ""green"" is outputted twice, which indicates that the output of ""bluf"" may depend on the context given by the words around it (both before and after ""bluf"").

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be context-dependent, but with a given set of examples, I can provide an inferred meaning:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" changes depending on its position and surrounding words. It can result in ""yellow,"" ""red,"" or ""green"" in the outputs, which suggests that ""bluf"" does not have a fixed meaning but rather one that is dependent on other factors in the sequence. Without more data, specifically regarding what triggers the color change for ""bluf"" (such as additional words or position), we cannot definitively deduce a single, consistent rule for its meaning.",-9.799624169820001,188,bluf
"Rule: bluf represents the color red when following the word ""wif"" and green when following the word ""dax"". When ""bluf"" is between the words ""wif"" and ""lug"", it represents the color yellow. Otherwise, ""bluf"" by itself or in other contexts is not clearly defined with the given examples. 

Thus, based on the context in which ""bluf"" is used, it could be that bluf -> ""red"" when it follows ""wif"", bluf -> ""green"" when it follows ""dax"", and bluf -> ""yellow"" when it is between ""wif"" and ""lug"". Other uses of ""bluf"" require more context or examples to determine its meaning.",-11.3796729027,188,bluf

- ""dax lug wif walm"" outputs ""green blue red red red,"" and since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""walm"" causes a repetition of ""red.""
- ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" outputs ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red,"" and directly before ""walm"" we have ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""walm"" repeats ""yellow.""

- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" which is again repeated.

In each example, the word immediately before ""walm"" is translated into a color, and the output for ""walm"" repeats that color for a number of times, equal to the total number of words present in the input phrase before ""walm,"" including ""walm"" itself.

Here's the breakdown:

1. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
   - ""wif"" translates to red, and since ""walm"" is the fourth word, its output is ""red"" repeated three times.

2. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   - ""zup"" translates to yellow, and ""walm"" is the fourth word, so its output consists of ""yellow"" repeated four times.

3. Input: zup walm wif

   - ""zup"" translates to yellow, and ""walm"" is the second word, resulting in ""yellow"" repeated twice.

4. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   - ""dax"" translates to green, and ""walm"" is the fourth word, creating an output of ""green"" repeated three times.

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" translates to yellow, and ""walm"" is the second word, so ""yellow"" is repeated twice.

Thus, the rule is:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color of the word immediately before ""walm"" as many times as the position of ""walm"" in the input phrase, minus one.",-5.7066622641040015,188,walm
"Analyzing the patterns given across the inputs and outputs:

1. When ""dax"" is used, the output is ""green"".
2. When ""lug"" is used, the output is ""blue"".
3. When ""wif"" is used, the output is ""red"".
4. When ""bluf"" is used, the output is followed by double ""red"" without the presence of ""wif"".
5. When ""zup"" is used, the output for every occurrence of ""zup"" is ""yellow"".

Focusing on the word ""walm"":

- In every instance ""walm"" appears, the outputs immediately following it match the color of the word preceding ""walm"".
- The number of times the color is repeated after ""walm"" is equal to the number of times the preceding word occurred in that input plus one.

For example:
- In the first input, ""wif"" occurs once, and after ""walm"" the output is ""red red red"" (i.e., the color for ""wif"" repeated three times).
- In the second input, ""zup"" occurs twice before ""walm"", and after ""walm"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"" (i.e., the color for ""zup"" repeated three times, which is two occurrences plus one).
- In the fourth input, ""dax"" occurs once before ""walm"", so the output after ""walm"" is ""green green green"".

"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to take the color of the word that immediately precedes it. If we analyze the patterns:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which suggests that ""walm"" takes the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.
  
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""lug wif,"" and since the output is a repetition of red after ""lug wif,"" we can assume ""walm"" takes the color of ""wif,"" which is red.

- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to the color blue, so the output after ""lug walm"" is ""blue blue blue.""

- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and hence the output includes three reds (""red red red"") after it, showing that ""walm"" takes the color of ""wif.""

- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows a ""zup,"" and the output is a sequence of yellow colors, signifying that ""walm"" takes the color of ""zup"" once again.

Considering this consistent pattern across the examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the word that precedes it.",-8.52523474032,189,walm

3. Input: lug walm zup -> Output: blue blue blue yellow
4. Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow
5. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

In each instance where ""walm"" appears, it repeats the color of the preceding word(s). Here's how it maps:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" becomes ""yellow yellow.""
2. When ""walm"" follows ""lug wif,"" which translates to ""blue red,"" ""walm"" becomes ""red red.""

5. When ""walm"" follows ""zup lug zup,"" translating to ""yellow blue yellow,"" ""walm"" becomes ""yellow yellow.""

"Rule: walm -> repeat the last color mentioned before walm, the same number of times as the number of words from 'walm' to the beginning of the input or until another color is mentioned.

- In ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug,"" 'walm' is preceded by 'red' ('wif') and there are two 'wif' words (red) before 'walm', so it repeats 'red' ('wif') twice.
- ""lug walm zup"" has 'blue' before 'walm', and no other color word between, so 'walm' here is one 'blue'.
- In ""wif walm dax zup,"" 'walm' is succeeded by 'red' ('wif') with no other color word between, which makes 'walm' here three 'red'.
- ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" has 'yellow' before 'walm' with two occurrences of 'zup' (yellow) before it, thus 'walm' is three 'yellow'.

5. ""wif walm dax"" translates to ""red red red green""—""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times, followed by ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green.""

Given these points and especially that each ""zup"" relates to the appearance of ""yellow"" in the output, the simplest rule that ""zup"" implies is that it translates to ""yellow.""

The corresponding colors in the output follow a consistent pattern that is dependent on a specific word from the input. Here are the observations supporting this rule:

- In the first two examples, ""zup bluf"" and ""wif bluf"" both translate to two identical colors repeated: ""yellow yellow"" and ""red red"" respectively. This suggests that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word preceding it.
- In the third example, ""zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue,"" indicating that ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""bluf"" still represents ""yellow,"" which comes from ""zup.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup bluf dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow green blue."" This means ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""bluf"" again takes the color of ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
- The fifth example, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" Every word translates to its corresponding color, and ""bluf"" follows the rule by taking the color of ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word immediately preceding it.",-1.000718122012,191,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be linked to the word preceding it. Specifically, ""bluf"" replicates the color represented by the word before it, as observed in the following examples:

- ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""bluf"" takes on the color of ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red,"" which shows that ""bluf"" here represents ""red,"" the color associated with ""wif.""
- In the cases where ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output for ""bluf"" is always ""yellow,"" reflecting the color associated with ""zup.""
- Similarly, when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""red.""

Therefore, ""bluf"" acts as a repetition of the color indicated by the word that comes right before it. 

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" takes on the color value of the word immediately preceding it in the sequence.",-5.7613973691,191,bluf
"bluf -> repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding bluf.

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows another word, repeat the color associated with that preceding word. If ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" then ""zup bluf"" would be ""yellow yellow."" If ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" then ""wif bluf"" would be ""red red."" The word ""bluf"" serves as an instruction to duplicate the color of the word before it.",-5.891525904748,191,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the word ""red"" when it follows ""wif,"" and to the word ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup."" However, when ""dax"" is present in the sequence after ""bluf,"" the word ""bluf"" is translated to ""green"" instead of its previous color. If ""lug"" is also present after ""bluf"" and ""dax,"" the rule for ""bluf"" being translated to ""green"" still applies, and ""lug"" is translated to ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" is conditional and depends on the presence and position of other words in the sequence.",-7.264312816894,191,bluf
Rule: bluf -> reduplicates the color associated with the previous word.,-8.972219104839999,191,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it’s possible to infer that the nonce word ""walm"" has a rule-based meaning that affects the output colors. In each instance, ""walm"" seems to repeat the last given color.

1. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> blue blue red blue red red red blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (which outputs red), and the output after ""walm"" is ""red red red"".
   
2. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (which outputs red), and the output after ""walm"" is ""red red red"".
   
3. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (which outputs red), and the output after ""walm"" is ""red red red"".
   
4. zup dax lug walm zup lug -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (which outputs blue), and the output after ""walm"" is ""blue blue"".
   
5. zup walm lug zup wif dax -> yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (which outputs yellow), and the output after ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow"".

From these examples, we can deduce:

Rule: The word ""walm"" repeats the output color of the word that comes immediately before it an unspecified number of times.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat last color mentioned.",-1.236937563222,191,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I must establish a pattern based on the given examples and the associated outputs.

Looking at the inputs and outputs, we should focus on when ""walm"" appears and what is immediately before or after it:

1. In the first example, ""lug wif walm lug"" translates to ""blue red red red blue,"" where ""lug"" seems to always translate to blue, ""wif"" seems to always translate to red, and ""walm lug"" translates to ""red red blue."" With ""walm"" coming after ""wif"" and before ""lug,"" it generates an additional ""red"" before the ""blue"" that signifies ""lug.""

2. In the second example, ""wif walm lug"" translates to ""red red red blue,"" again showing the pattern where ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and translates to an additional ""red"" before ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

3. In the third example, ""wif walm"" becomes ""red red red,"" showing that ""walm"" after ""wif"" adds two more ""red.""

4. The fourth example contains ""lug walm zup lug,"" which translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue."" Here ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""zup."" The occurrence of ""walm"" yields a repeated color of whatever precedes it (here, ""blue"").

5. In the final example, ""walm lug zup wif dax"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green."" In this example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (which translates to yellow) and is followed by ""lug."" The output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue..."", therefore when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" it also results in additional instances of the precedent color.

Based on these observations, we can establish the following rule for ""walm"":

**Rule:** ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color denoted by the word immediately preceding it.

Expressing this as a definition:

walm -> Causes the previous color word to be repeated in the output sequence.",-6.177968667259999,191,walm
"To figure out what ""walm"" means, we need to analyze the examples and outputs provided, looking for patterns.

In the first example, after the word ""walm,"" the output has three consecutive ""red"" colors followed by one ""blue"":

- Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
- Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

In the second example, after the word ""walm"" there are three consecutive ""red"" again, followed by a ""blue"":

- Input: zup wif walm lug
- Output: yellow red red red blue

In the third example, ""walm"" is followed by three ""red"":

- Input: zup wif walm
- Output: yellow red red red

In the fourth example, where ""walm"" is followed by ""zup lug"", we notice that it is again followed by three versions of the next color, ""blue"" in this case:

- Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
- Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

In the fifth, ""walm"" results in three consecutive outputs of the next color which is ""yellow"":

- Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
- Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

From examining all the examples, it seems that ""walm"" results in three consecutive occurrences of the color assigned to the next word in sequence before resuming the previous pattern. Therefore:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the next word in the sequence three times.",-8.383593781381999,191,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns before and after ""walm"" in the given input and the corresponding outputs.

1. In the first example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""lug"". This results in ""red red red blue"".
2. In the second example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" only. The corresponding output is ""red red red"".
3. In the third example, ""walm"" is again preceded by ""wif"" and is not followed by anything. The corresponding output is ""red red red"".
4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup lug"" which results in ""blue blue blue yellow blue"".
5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug zup"" which translates to ""yellow yellow blue yellow"".

Looking at the outputs preceding and following the word ""walm"", it appears that ""walm"" itself does not correspond to a single color. Instead, it seems to induce a repetition or extension pattern based on the color that comes before it. In examples where ""wif"" (which translates to ""red"") comes before ""walm"", the output is a repetition of ""red"" three times. When there is a sequence following ""walm"", such as ""lug zup"" or ""zup lug"" in examples 4 and 5, the subsequent colors repeat in a similar or patterned way.

Walm seems to create a repetition of the color associated with the word just before it, repeating it three times if the word is ""wif"" (example 2 and 3: ""wif walm""), or transforming it into a color pattern if followed by a sequence (example 4: ""lug walm zup lug"" and example 5: ""walm lug zup"").

So, the rule induced is as follows:
Rule: ""walm"" causes the color word just prior to repeat three times if alone, or influences a color pattern when subsequent color words are given.",-9.630094020940001,191,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it until a new color word appears. For example, in the first input, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and after ""walm"" is introduced, ""red"" is repeated until ""lug"" (which stands for blue) appears. In other cases, such as the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), and the output is ""blue"" repeated until a new color (in this case ""zup"" for yellow) appears.

Rule:
walm -> Repeats the color associated with the previous word until a new color word is mentioned.",-10.753294067470001,191,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""lug,"" let's review the examples provided:

Input 1: lug
Output 1: blue

Input 2: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output 2: red red green green red red red blue red

Input 3: lug
Output 3: blue

Input 4: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
Output 4: blue red red green blue blue

Input 5: lug dax walm
Output 5: blue green green green

Based on the outputs corresponding to each input where ""lug"" appears, we see that every single instance of ""lug"" is consistently translated to ""blue."" There do not appear to be any additional context-dependent rules affecting the translation of ""lug"" regardless of the other words present.

Rule: 
lug -> blue",-1.12947657232,192,lug

"lug -> blue

Rule:
Based on the provided examples, each instance of the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue,"" regardless of the context in which it appears. Therefore, lug consistently means blue.",-10.433660652859999,192,lug
"Based on the examples given, we can infer the following:

- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red.""
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""walm"" seems to have variable output, but it corresponds to ""green"" when following ""dax.""

Moreover, every time ""dax"" precedes another word, ""green"" is added to the output, one extra time if the following word is ""walm,"" and only once for the other words.

Thus, we can deduce:

dax -> meaning. Rule:
- When ""dax"" precedes ""lug,"" ""wif,"" or ""zup,"" it adds ""green"" to the output once.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" it adds ""green"" to the output twice.

It is important to note that more examples would be necessary to fully confirm this rule, but based on the given information, this seems to be a consistent pattern.",-7.510004006000001,192,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""dax,"" let's first look for patterns in the input and the corresponding output.

Analyzing the first example:
- Input: dax lug wif
- Output: green blue red

In this example, the word ""dax"" corresponded to ""green.""

Analyzing the second example:
- Input: zup walm dax
- Output: yellow yellow yellow green

Here, ""dax"" is at the end and again corresponds to ""green.""

Analyzing the third example:
- Input: dax zup wif zup
- Output: green yellow red yellow

Once more, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" at the beginning of the sequence.

Analyzing the fourth example:
- Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
- Output: green green green red blue green green green

In this sequence, ""dax"" appears twice and each time it corresponds to ""green.""

Analyzing the final example:
- Input: dax lug wif lug
- Output: green blue red blue

Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Based on all of the examples given, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green,"" no matter its position in the sequence. Therefore, we can conclude:

Rule: dax -> green",-8.962933894474999,192,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can observe that each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output at the same position. Therefore, it appears that ""dax"" translates directly to ""green"". Here's the rule established by this assessment:

Rule: dax -> green",-10.69596287974,192,dax
"Based on the examples provided where the word ""dax"" appears, it seems that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green."" Therefore, the rule can be inferred as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",-10.85987313766,192,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we must look for patterns in the examples given. Here are the patterns we can see:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, the word ""green"" appears in the output. 
- ""dax"" does not depend on its position in the list (first, last, middle) for ""green"" to appear.
- No matter how many times ""dax"" appears, ""green"" appears an equal number of times.

Therefore, we can induce the rule that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green",-10.99485980978,192,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" seems consistently linked to the color ""red"". In every instance where ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" is present in the corresponding output.

Thus, the rule appears to be:

wif -> red

Rule: When the input contains ""wif,"" the output contains the color ""red"" for each occurrence.",-9.60168476838,192,wif
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" correlates directly with the color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. There is no indication that the meaning of ""wif"" changes based on position or surrounding words. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

wif -> red

Rule: Each occurrence of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output.",-10.19962905408,192,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" each time it appears, regardless of its position or the context within the sequence of nonce words.

Rule: wif -> red.",-10.427395360580002,192,wif
Rule: wif -> red,-10.5957776762,192,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently correlates with the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the context provided by surrounding words. Each occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds directly to the word ""red."" Therefore, we can deduce the following:

Rule: wif -> red",-10.63472341132,192,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can observe how the output changes when ""zup"" is introduced. Here's the breakdown:

1. lug walm -> blue blue
2. dax bluf -> green green
3. zup lug -> yellow blue
4. lug wif lug walm -> blue red blue blue
5. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow

When comparing the outputs, we see that typically, a word maps to a single color, but when ""zup"" is introduced, the color yellow is outputted, and the pattern of colors that follows is sometimes altered. More specifically, ""zup"" appears to output yellow and also influence the subsequent color pattern.

- In the first example, ""lug walm zup lug walm"" gives us ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue"". The sequence 'blue blue' is repeated, then interrupted by ""zup"" and resumes after a single ""yellow."" 
- In the second example, ""dax bluf zup"" gives us ""green green yellow"". The sequence 'green green' is disrupted by a ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup.""
- In the third example, ""zup lug"" outputs ""yellow blue,"" directly mapping ""zup"" to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif"" outputs ""blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red,"" where ""zup"" precedes a sequence of ""yellow"" outputs but does not seem to disrupt the sequence of colors; instead, it adds ""yellow"" and the prior sequences continue normally before and after, except for an additional ""yellow"".
- In the fifth example, ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow,"" demonstrating that ""zup"" precedes a series of ""yellow,"" perhaps suggesting that ""zup"" might multiply the following color output.

Given this information, the rule seems to be that ""zup"" outputs a ""yellow"" and either repeats this color or continues to exert influence on the subsequent words by potentially extending their associated color or causing a sequence of ""yellow."" However, there's a degree of uncertainty in predicting the exact influence on the following pattern without a more consistent set of examples.

Rule: zup -> first outputs ""yellow,"" then may influence the subsequent pattern, typically extending the subsequent color or adding ""yellow"" to the sequence.",-1.012716947122,192,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's examine the patterns present in the input and the corresponding output.

1. ""lug walm zup lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue""
2. ""dax bluf zup"" -> ""green green yellow""
3. ""zup lug"" -> ""yellow blue""
4. ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif"" -> ""blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red""
5. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""

Observing each instance where ""zup"" appears in the input, its corresponding output counterpart is ""yellow."" Additionally, the presence of ""zup"" doesn't seem to affect the color associated with the words following it.

From this evidence, the simplest deduction would be that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",-1.1101929968620001,192,zup
"Given the examples provided, zup seems to change the color sequence in a patterned manner. Upon a more detailed inspection of the examples, one can see that each occurrence of zup results in the word ""yellow"" in the output.

Input: lug walm zup lug walm
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
Analysis: Before ""zup"", there are two ""blue"" colors in a sequence. Following ""zup"", the pattern resumes with one ""yellow"" signaling its placement and the sequence continues with ""blue"".

Input: dax bluf zup
Output: green green yellow
Analysis: Both ""dax"" and ""bluf"" result in ""green"" before ""zup"". ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow"", which is consistent with its introduction changing the output to ""yellow"".

Input: zup lug
Output: yellow blue
Analysis: ""zup"" is at the beginning and is followed by ""yellow"", then ""lug"" produces ""blue"".

Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
Analysis: The pattern is consistent with ""lug"" and ""wif"" colors, but after ""zup"", we see three ""yellow"" before resuming with ""red"". This seems to break the pattern observed previously, but we can hypothesize that ""zup"" introduced three ""yellow"" instead of just one, potentially indicating that ""zup"" produces a number of ""yellow"" equivalent to the number of unique colors seen before it (excluding any previous yellows attributed to ""zup"").

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
Analysis: As no colors precede ""zup"", the logic that ""zup"" produces as many ""yellow"" outputs as there are unique colors preceding it appears to hold, since ""walm"" seems to be associated with ""yellow"" when following ""zup"".

Based on these observations, without knowing how ""zup"" affects the sequence when more than two unique colors precede it, the tentative rule could be:

Rule: ""zup"" -> When ""zup"" is mentioned, it results in the color ""yellow"" being produced in the output. The number of ""yellow"" instances produced by ""zup"" seems to be equal to the number of unique color words that precede ""zup"" since its last occurrence, excluding any ""yellow"" outputs that were directly caused by a ""zup"". If ""zup"" is the first word or if no unique colors precede it, it produces one ""yellow"". 

Considering the limited context, this rule is speculative and may not hold with further data.",-6.198696780015,192,zup
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""zup"" determines the output color pattern before it occurs. Each instance of ""zup"" is followed by a series of non-yellow output colors that match the pattern of colors that occurred before ""zup."" The ""zup"" itself is represented as yellow in the output pattern. Here's the observation:

- In the first example, before ""zup,"" the pattern is 'blue blue' which, after ""zup,"" repeats as 'blue blue blue'.
- In the second example, before ""zup,"" there is no pattern, but ""zup"" is still followed by a yellow.
- In the third example, ""zup"" is in the beginning and is followed by a blue.
- In the fourth example, before ""zup,"" we have 'blue red blue blue' which is followed by 'blue yellow yellow yellow red.' We can notice that the pattern 'blue blue' repeats after ""zup,"" with the pattern slightly altered with an additional yellow for each repeat, until it's followed by the previous color red.
- The fifth example follows the rule from the first example but only with 'yellow yellow yellow' following the ""zup.""

So, we can deduce:

zup -> meaning: Yellow, followed by a repetition of the color pattern preceding ""zup,"" with yellow interspersed or modifying the repeating pattern.

Rule: When ""zup"" appears, transform it to ""yellow,"" and repeat the color pattern preceding ""zup"" with potential alterations including additional yellows.",-6.28436284154,192,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow,"" while other input words are mapped to different colors. For instance, ""lug"" is consistently mapped to ""blue,"" ""walm"" is mapped to ""yellow"" in sequence with ""zup"" but to ""blue"" otherwise, and ""dax"" is mapped to ""green."" 

It's also worth noting that the presence of ""zup"" affects the repetition of certain colors in the output. When ""zup"" appears after ""lug walm,"" the sequence of ""yellow"" in output increases (Example 1). In Example 4, after ""zup,"" the color ""yellow"" shows up three times consecutively, whereas ""walm"" that follows doesn't translate to ""blue"" as it did before. Therefore, it seems that when ""zup"" appears, it changes the sequence of output colors, causing a repetition of ""yellow.""

So, the rule for ""zup"" appears to be:

Rule: ""zup"" translates to the output color ""yellow,"" and causes a repetition of ""yellow"" based on some context of surrounding words or sequence.",-8.51861686578,192,zup
"Rule: ""bluf"" translates to ""red."" 

Let's examine the examples provided:

1. ""wif bluf dax walm"" results in ""red red green green green"". The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" as seen in the last example, ""wif bluf"" gives ""red red"". This is consistent with ""dax walm"" giving ""green green green"".

2. ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green"". The word ""dax"" means ""green"", as indicated by previous examples.

3. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" results in ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red"". We know ""lug"" means ""blue"" and ""zup"" means ""yellow"". Since ""walm dax wif"" correlates with ""yellow green red"", we can deduce by the process of elimination and consistency in the pattern that ""bluf"" correlates with ""red"".

4. ""zup bluf lug zup"" results in ""yellow yellow blue yellow"". Given that ""lug"" means ""blue"" and ""zup"" means ""yellow"", and no green is in the output, ""bluf"" cannot mean ""green"".

5. ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"", reinforcing the pattern that ""wif"" and ""bluf"" both mean ""red"".

Therefore, bluf -> red.",-0.7835723770940001,192,bluf
"Observing the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the rule that governs the appearance of the word ""bluf"". 

1. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
2. dax bluf -> green green
3. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
4. zup bluf lug zup -> yellow yellow blue yellow
5. wif bluf -> red red

One pattern that emerges is that the word ""bluf"" consistently results in the word ""red,"" irrespective of its position in the input or the surrounding words.

This leads to the rule:

bluf -> red

This means every time we see 'bluf', it corresponds to 'red' in the output.",-0.98062485104,192,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to correlate with the color that follows its associated nonce word. The color following ""bluf"" alternates between red and green when preceded by ""wif"" or ""dax,"" and it is consistently yellow when preceded by ""zup."" However, when ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output is blue.

Here's the breakdown:

- ""wif bluf"" consistently leads to ""red red"".
- ""dax bluf"" consistently leads to ""green green"".
- ""zup bluf"" consistently leads to ""yellow yellow"".
- ""bluf lug"" is not as straightforward, but in the one instance it is provided, it translates to blue.

Based on the available data, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color that its preceding word corresponds to, with the following exceptions:
- When followed by ""lug,"" the output color is blue.
- This rule presumes a consistent correspondence between the nonce words ""wif,"" ""dax,"" ""zup"" and the colors red, green, yellow respectively.

Therefore:

bluf -> repeats the color of the previous word, except when followed by ""lug,"" where it turns to blue.",-6.19462869404,192,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the rule seems to associate the made-up word ""bluf"" with a color output. The rule also indicates that ""bluf"" might affect the color output of the word immediately preceding it. To decipher the rule for ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns in each example:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" turns the preceding word (""wif"") into a repetitive color output.
- In the second example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" which also shows that ""bluf"" repeats the color output for the word before it.
- The third example indicates that when ""wif bluf"" appears, the output is ""red red,"" consistent with the first example.
- The fourth and fifth examples further support the idea that ""bluf"" repeats the color output of the word that comes just before it.

The pattern across these examples is consistent, showing that ""bluf"" causes the preceding word to be repeated in the output.

Thus, the rule is:
bluf -> When ""bluf"" follows any word, the color output of that word is repeated.",-6.95050927848,192,bluf
"Analyzing the given examples and focusing on the use of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we can try to infer the meaning based on its relation to other words and the corresponding output patterns:

2. Input: dax bluf

4. Input: zup bluf lug zup
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow
   
5. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

We can observe that the output color associated with ""bluf"" directly follows the output color of the word presented before it. To illustrate:

- In example 1, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red.""
- In example 2, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green.""
- In example 3, ""wif"" corresponds to ""green"" (since ""dax"" before ""wif"" corresponds to ""green""), and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In example 4, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" follows with ""yellow.""
- In example 5, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and so does ""bluf.""

From the above analysis, we can deduce that ""bluf"" replicates the color output of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" takes on the output color of the word immediately before it. If the word before ""bluf"" has a corresponding output color of ""X,"" then ""bluf"" will also correspond to the color ""X.""",-9.279119114798002,192,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it. Let's verify this rule with the provided examples:

Example 1: lug dax walm wif
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- walm -> repeats the color of dax, which is green
- wif -> red
Output: blue green green green red

Example 2: zup walm
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> repeats the color of zup, which is yellow
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Example 3: dax lug walm
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- walm -> repeats the color of lug, which is blue
Output: green blue blue blue

Example 4: dax walm zup lug walm
- dax -> green
- walm -> repeats the color of dax, which is green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- walm -> repeats the color of lug, which is blue
Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

Example 5: lug walm wif lug
- lug -> blue
- walm -> repeats the color of lug, which is blue
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
Output: blue blue blue red blue

Each occurrence of ""walm"" changes its output color to match the color mentioned before it. Thus, the rule for ""walm"" can be summarized as:

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the preceding word.",-5.347769803644001,192,walm
"Observing the given inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of ""walm"" considering the outputs that follow it. Paying particular attention to the color that follows the occurrence of walm in every output sequence, it is consistent that the color after ""walm"" is repeated based on the number of times ""walm"" appears until there is a different word.

For example, 
- In the first input, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" and the corresponding output of ""walm"" is ""green"" which is repeated three times until ""wif"" changes the color to ""red"".
- In the third input, ""walm"" is followed by no other word, hence ""blue"" is repeated four times.
- The pattern is consistent for all provided examples.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color immediately following its appearance for as many times as ""walm"" appears or until a different word breaks the sequence.

Rule: walm -> Causes the next mentioned color to be repeated for the count equal to the number of consecutive ""walm""s present or until a different word appears.",-8.01165204216,192,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" from the provided examples, it is necessary to analyze the relationship between the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

From the first example:
Input: lug dax walm wif
Output: blue green green green red

We see that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""; however, ""walm"" is followed by two greens and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". We'll need more information.

From the second example:
Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Here ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" is producing two additional yellows.

From the third example:
Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

""Dax"" is ""green"" again and ""lug"" is ""blue"", but ""walm"" follows with three blues, like the three greens in the first example.

From the fourth example:
Input: dax walm zup lug walm
Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

Again, ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""lug"" is ""blue"". ""Walm"" after ""dax"" produces two more greens, and ""walm"" after ""lug"" produces two more blues. 

From the fifth example:
Input: lug walm wif lug
Output: blue blue blue red blue

""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" following it repeats the color blue two more times.

Rule:
From these examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it two more times in the output. If ""walm"" follows a color word, the output for ""walm"" will be that same color word repeated in the next two positions.

Therefore:
walm -> repeat the preceding color two more times.",-8.153927431799998,192,walm
"Based on the examples given, it seems that the word ""walm"" does not have a fixed color association. Instead, the color that ""walm"" represents changes based on the word that immediately precedes it. Here is the pattern that emerges from the examples:

1. When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the color output for ""walm"" is ""blue.""
2. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the color output for ""walm"" is ""green.""
3. When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the color output for ""walm"" is ""yellow.""

There are no examples with ""wif"" preceding ""walm"" to determine its output, nor is there an output for ""walm"" on its own. Given the examples, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" takes on the color output associated with the word preceding it.

Rule: walm -> takes the color associated with the previous word. If the previous word is ""lug,"" ""walm"" is blue. If the previous word is ""dax,"" ""walm"" is green. If the previous word is ""zup,"" ""walm"" is yellow.",-9.44841125796,192,walm
"Rule: walm -> the color that is the same as the preceding word. If the preceding word is 'lug', walm is blue. If the preceding word is 'dax', walm is green. If the preceding word is 'zup', walm is yellow. If 'walm' follows 'wif', there is no previous color indicated for 'wif', so this rule cannot be directly applied; however, in the context provided, 'walm' still takes the color of the word it follows, which is 'wif', resulting in 'walm' being red after 'wif'.",-10.1118656523,192,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Each time the word ""lug"" is used in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output. Additionally, the other words correspond to different colors: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Here are the rules for each word based on the given examples:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- walm -> multiple reds based on the number of times the word ""walm"" appears

Given these observations, the rule for ""lug"" is:

lug -> blue",-4.282558067599999,193,lug

In all examples, every instance of the word `lug` consistently results in the output ""blue."" This is the case regardless of position or neighboring words (e.g., `dax`, `wif`, `walm`). 

Thus, we can conclude the following rule:

"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or the rule behind the nonce word ""dax."" To do so, we'll look at where ""dax"" appears in the input and its corresponding output.

1. ""lug wif dax"" -> ""blue red green""
2. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
3. ""zup dax"" -> ""yellow green""
4. ""dax wif walm lug zup"" -> ""green red red red blue yellow""
5. ""lug dax"" -> ""blue green""

Let's analyze the inputs and outputs:

- In example 1, ""dax"" is preceded by ""lug"" and ""wif,"" with corresponding colors ""blue"" and ""red;"" the output for ""dax"" is ""green.""
- In example 2, ""dax"" comes at the beginning and is followed by ""lug"" and ""walm,"" which corresponds to the output ""green"" followed by ""blue"" and ""blue blue.""
- In example 3, ""dax"" is preceded by ""zup,"" and the corresponding output colors are ""yellow green.""
- In example 4, ""dax"" appears at the beginning again and is followed by multiple words with corresponding sequences of colors.
- In example 5, ""dax"" comes after ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue green.""

We can observe that whenever ""dax"" appears, the color ""green"" is in the output. Furthermore, ""dax"" is not associated with a specific position in the list except that it is never last. Hence, the most consistent rule that can be deduced from the given examples is that ""dax"" translates directly to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green",-1.010754668304,193,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's look at the pattern of input and corresponding output colors.

1. “lug wif dax” maps to “blue red green”
2. “dax lug walm” maps to “green blue blue blue”
3. “zup dax” maps to “yellow green”
4. “dax wif walm lug zup” maps to “green red red red blue yellow”
5. “lug dax” maps to “blue green”

Observations:

- Every time ""dax"" appears, ""green"" is the corresponding output.
- ""lug"" always corresponds with ""blue.""
- ""wif"" always corresponds with ""red.""
- ""walm"" appears to correspond with ""red"" but also results in repetition of the color (""blue"" in the second example, ""red"" in the fourth) following its position.
- ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow.""

Given the input and output patterns, the following rule can be deduced:

Rule: ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""",-1.2728218468399999,193,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following relationships:

1. lug -> blue
2. wif -> red
3. walm -> (blue blue blue)
4. zup -> yellow

With ""dax"" appearing in various places and given the outputs after rearranging the sequences, it seems that dax represents the color green. Every occurrence of ""dax"" yields ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green",-4.3470142137000005,193,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to analyze its correlation with the output in various positions and contexts. One approach is to look at the constancy of ""dax"" placement and the corresponding output color.

- In the first and fifth examples, ""dax"" is placed after ""lug,"" leading to an output of ""green"" after ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" is placed after ""lug"" as well, and the sequence begins with ""green blue.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" appears after ""zup,"" correlating with an output of ""yellow green.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" comes first and is followed by a color sequence that starts with ""green.""

Based on this information, we can deduce that ""dax"" translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence. There is consistency in the following pattern: whenever ""dax"" appears, the output color ""green"" directly follows it.

"Rule: dax -> green

Explanation: Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output, regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence. This consistency across the examples suggests that ""dax"" translates directly to ""green.""",-9.244256700400001,193,dax
"By analyzing the input and output examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the outputs. Here's the breakdown for clarification:

- Every instance of the word ""wif"" in the input is replaced by the word ""red"" in the output.
- The word ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" in the output.
- The word ""walm"" translates to ""red"" in the output. However, the presence of ""wif"" before ""walm"" could indicate emphasis, as it turns ""walm"" into a repeated ""red red"".
- The word ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" in the output.
- The word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" in the output.
- The word ""dax"" translates to ""green"" in the output.

Considering this consistent translation in various contexts where ""wif"" is present, the word ""wif"" can be deduced to mean ""red"". Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",-7.5268047385140004,193,wif
"Analyzing the examples and their corresponding outputs, we can deduce the following patterns for each input word and the respective color:

- walm -> red (consistent across all examples where ""walm"" is present)
- lug -> blue (consistent across all examples where ""lug"" is present)
- bluf -> yellow (in the given examples, ""bluf"" always results in yellow)
- zup -> yellow (in the given examples, ""zup"" always results in yellow)
- dax -> green (only shown in one example, but ""dax"" results in green)

Every time the word ""wif"" is present, the output is consistently ""red"". Thus, it is clear that the word ""wif"" is directly translated to ""red"" in the output, regardless of context or position in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red",-7.60558595686,193,wif

- Every occurrence of the word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
- The word ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
- The word ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
- The word ""dax walm"" together translates to ""green green green.""

We can notice that the output is a sequence of color names corresponding to the input sequence, with each nonce word and phrase being consistently associated with the same color or sequence of colors. 

Based on these observations, the rule is:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" means ""yellow.""",-5.54530070972,193,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to induce the rules for what ""zup"" means. Let's look at each input and the corresponding output to see if we can identify a pattern:

1. Input: zup wif zup
   Output: yellow red yellow
   - ""wif"" correlates to ""red"", and each instance of ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow"".

2. Input: zup wif bluf zup
   Output: yellow red red yellow
   - Again, ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and we can assume ""bluf"" correlates to ""red"" here as well.

3. Input: zup lug
   Output: yellow blue
   - ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"".

4. Input: dax walm wif zup

   - ""dax"" and ""walm"" correlate to ""green"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"".

5. Input: zup dax walm
   Output: yellow green green green
   - ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow"" and ""dax walm"" to repeated ""green"".

- Whenever ""bluf"" follows another word, the output word for ""bluf"" is identical to the output for the word it follows.
- When ""bluf"" appears as the first word, it seems that its output matches its last occurrence in the previous input-output pair.

Let's verify this rule with the given examples:

1. In ""wif bluf zup bluf wif,"" ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and ""zup"" and takes on the outputs ""red"" and ""yellow"" respectively, which match the words it follows. It's output for when it follows ""wif"" at the end can't be determined independently since it starts and ends with ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"".

2. In ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug,"" ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and takes on the output ""yellow,"" again confirming the rule.

3. In ""zup bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and its output is ""yellow,"" which corresponds to the output for ""zup.""

4. In ""zup wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and takes on the output ""red,"" again confirming our rule.

5. In ""wif lug zup bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and its output is ""yellow,"" which matches ""zup.""

- ""wif lug walm"" translates to ""red blue blue blue"". Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". The word ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it multiple times.

- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"". ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""walm"" repeats it multiple times.

- ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"". ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""walm"" repeats it multiple times.

- ""dax lug walm zup wif"" translates to ""green blue blue blue yellow red"". Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""wif"" to ""red"". ""Walm"" repeats the color of ""lug"", which is ""blue"", multiple times before moving to the next color.

- ""dax walm wif"" translates to ""green green green red"". ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red"". ""Walm"" repeats the color of ""dax"", which is ""green"", multiple times.

- ""lug walm"" -> blue blue blue
- ""wif walm"" -> red red red
- ""dax lug walm zup wif"" -> green blue blue blue yellow red
- ""dax walm wif"" -> green green green red

- ""lug walm"" results in blue followed by repeated blue.
- ""wif walm"" results in red followed by repeated red.
- ""wif lug walm"" results in the output ""red blue blue blue"" where ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""walm"" follows with repeated blue.
- ""dax lug walm"" results in green followed by blue and then repeated blue, where ""lug"" is associated with blue.

In the case of ""dax walm wif,"" we see ""green green green red"" where ""dax"" corresponds to green, and it's followed by repeated green as a result of ""walm,"" until a new word ""wif"" which corresponds to red.

From these examples, we can notice that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to repeat an unspecified number of times. It is important to note that the repetition occurs only until a new word, which has a different corresponding color, appears post ""walm.""

- If ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" then ""walm"" means ""green.""

- In the second example, ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"" resulting in ""blue blue blue"".
- In the third example, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" leading to ""red red red"", and again ""lug"" followed by ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"".
- The fourth example directly shows ""lug"" followed by ""walm"" translating again to ""blue blue blue"".

Rule: walm -> repeats the color that directly precedes it in the sequence.",-7.861974901131999,194,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" is associated with a repetition of the color that follows the corresponding noun. When ""walm"" appears, the color of the noun after ""walm"" is repeated for a number of times equal to the order of appearance of ""walm"".

For instance:
- In the first input, ""walm"" occurs twice, so ""lug"" which is blue is repeated once after the first ""walm,"" and then ""zup"" which is yellow is repeated thrice after the second ""walm"" (since it's the second occurrence of walm).
- Similarly, in the second input, ""walm"" appears once, so ""lug,"" which follows and is blue, is repeated once.
- In the third input, ""walm"" appears twice. The color after the first ""walm,"" which is ""dax"" (green), is repeated once, and the color after the second ""walm,"" which is ""lug"" (blue), is repeated twice (since it's the second occurrence of walm).
- The fourth example only has ""walm"" once, so ""lug"" (blue) is repeated thrice.
- The fifth example also has ""walm"" once, so ""wif"" (red) is repeated thrice.

In summary, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the next noun's corresponding color to be repeated a number of times based on the occurrence order of ""walm"".

"By examining the patterns where the word 'walm' appears and the colors that are outputted, let's break it down:

- Wherever we see 'walm', the color 'blue' is present in the output consistently.
- Additionally, 'walm' seems to correspond to a repetitious pattern, as the word 'blue' is repeated several times after 'walm' appears.

From these observations, a possible rule can be generated:

Rule: The word 'walm' indicates that the following color should be 'blue', and that 'blue' should be repeated until a new color word appears in the input.

Thus, the rule induction for 'walm' suggests:

walm -> The next colors will be 'blue' repeated until another color command is given.",-14.277490474432,194,walm

Considering where ""lug"" appears and the respective output colors, we see the following pattern:

- When ""lug"" is used, the output is consistently ""blue.""
- There are no exceptions or conditions where ""lug"" leads to a different output color in the given examples.

Based on this information, we can conclude the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue,-11.714602746999999,195,lug
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following rules about the word 'dax' and its relation to output colors:

1. When 'dax' is present in the input, 'green' always appears in the corresponding output. This happens regardless of the position of 'dax' in the input sequence.
2. The word 'wif' produces 'red' when in the presence of 'dax'.
3. The word 'lug' produces 'blue' when in the presence of 'dax'.
4. Repetitions of the word 'dax' result in repetitions of 'green' in the output.
5. The word 'walm' seems to produce 'green' when 'dax' precedes it, suggesting that perhaps 'dax' has some transformative effect on the output color associated with words following it.
6. The word 'bluf' results in two 'red's following in the next outputs, but only if 'dax' and another 'green' producing word precede it. Without 'dax', we cannot be sure of the direct meaning of 'bluf'.

Combining these observations, we can create a rule for the meaning of 'dax':

Rule: The presence of 'dax' in an input generates 'green' in the output and may also alter the output color associated with the following word(s). 

So the general rule seems to be:
dax -> green (and potential transformation of subsequent outputs)",-4.942645001400001,195,dax
"Analyzing the given examples:

1. Input: dax wif dax
   Output: green red green
   Rule: dax maps to 'green'. Since 'wif' appears between two 'dax' and maps to 'red', it may be inferred that 'wif' changes its color based on its position or surrounding words.

2. Input: dax lug wif
   Output: green blue red
   Rule: Here, 'dax' again maps to 'green', and since 'lug' is not surrounded by 'dax', it maps to 'blue'. 'wif' at the end of a sequence maps to 'red'.

3. Input: dax
   Output: green
   Rule: Without any additional context, 'dax' alone maps to 'green'.

4. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   Rule: 'dax' maps to 'green'. 'walm' following 'dax' maps to 'green' as well, despite being a different word. 'wif' maps to 'red' and seems to trigger an additional 'red' response when followed by 'bluf'.

5. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Rule: 'dax' continues to map to 'green'. 'lug' maps to 'blue' and is followed by 'walm', which also maps to 'blue'. It seems that 'walm' may retain the color of the preceding word unless it follows 'dax' directly. 

Given these inputs and outputs, the consistent rule that we can deduce is: 'dax' maps to 'green'. As for the other words, they seem to have contingent rules based on their position or preceding words. However, the rule relating to 'dax' specifically seems stable across all examples.

Rule: dax -> green",-5.307190252191001,195,dax
"From the given examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time ""dax"" is present in the input, ""green"" is present in the output at the corresponding position. No other word in the examples consistently maps to ""green,"" and ""dax"" does not map to any other word in the output. The presence of ""dax"" in a single instance (""Input: dax"") that outputs ""green"" alone further solidifies the one-to-one relationship between ""dax"" and ""green."" 

However, it should also be noted that there is a pattern in the color assignments of other words as well, regardless of their position relative to ""dax."" The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" The pattern of multiple ""walm"" following ""lug"" or ""dax"" corresponds to repeats of the color associated with the previous word.

Based on this information, the rules we can deduce are as follows:

Rule:
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""walm"" -> repeat the color of the word before ""walm""
- ""bluf"" -> red (by elimination from ""Input: dax walm wif bluf"" since other words' colors are known)",-5.89389218296,195,dax

- ""walm"" may also correspond to ""green"" as it does in the example ""dax walm wif bluf,"" but further examples would be needed to confirm this.
- It seems that repeating the word ""dax"" does not change the corresponding color output; it remains ""green.""
- There is not enough information to determine what the word ""bluf"" corresponds to.

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. By comparing the inputs with their respective outputs, we can deduce the meaning of each word including the nonce word 'wif'.

- The word 'zup' is present in three inputs and each time it translates to the color 'yellow'.
- The word 'dax' appears in two different inputs and in both cases, the output ends with 'green'.
- The word 'bluf' appears in three different inputs and corresponds to the color 'red' each time it is not preceded by 'wif'.

Rule: wif -> red.,-8.95890153746,195,wif
"By analyzing the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""zup.""

In the first input-output pair, every time ""zup"" appears, it is followed by ""dax"" and the color sequence ""yellow green"" repeats accordingly. However, this pattern does not hold in the other examples.

In the second pair, ""zup"" is adjacent to ""dax"" and the color ""yellow green"" follows, but it is preceded by ""lug"" which corresponds to the color ""blue."" This suggests ""zup"" does not depend on the preceding word to be translated as ""yellow.""

The third example is consistent with ""zup"" being followed by ""yellow"" again, even though the words that follow it (""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""dax"") correspond to different colors (""red,"" ""blue,"" ""green"").

The fourth example solidifies the translation of ""zup"" as ""yellow,"" as it appears multiple times and is always followed by the color ""yellow,"" regardless of the context.

The fifth example further supports the independent translation of ""zup"" as ""yellow,"" even when it is at the end of the sequence.

From these examples, it seems clear that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position or context within the given sequence.

- walm -> yellow (inferred from the fourth input, as it is the only non-repeated word followed by dax, which gives green, and since zup is associated with yellow in all other cases, walm seems to associate with yellow as well)

1. Every time zup appears, the output is ""yellow."" 
2. It does not seem to matter where zup appears in the input; it always corresponds to ""yellow.""

"Given the set of examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to a particular color output each time it is used. Across different examples, ""zup"" consistently results in the output ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow. This means ""zup"" signifies the color yellow.",-9.52266157338,196,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the instances where it appears and analyze the corresponding outputs:

1. ""dax bluf zup"" corresponds to ""green green yellow""
2. ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" corresponds to ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue""
3. ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow""
4. ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax"" corresponds to ""red red yellow red blue green""
5. ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" corresponds to ""blue green green yellow blue red""

By examining the positions of ""bluf"" and the color it is paired with in the output, the following can be observed:
- When ""bluf"" is in the second position, it's ""green"" (examples 1, 4, and 5).
- When ""bluf"" is in the fourth position, it's ""yellow"" (example 2).
- When ""bluf"" is the second word in a two-word input, it's ""yellow"" (example 3).

Based on these examples, the color associated with ""bluf"" does not seem to follow a strict positional or contextual rule that can be inferred from the given data. However, one possible rule is that ""bluf"" is ""green"" when it immediately follows ""dax,"" and ""yellow"" otherwise. 

Rule: bluf is ""green"" when it immediately follows the word ""dax,"" and ""yellow"" in all other positions.",-0.8581132121239999,196,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns that correspond with the presence of ""bluf"" and its resulting color in the outputs:

1. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
2. zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue
3. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
4. wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> red red yellow red blue green
5. lug dax bluf zup lug wif -> blue green green yellow blue red

Examining the examples:
- In example 1, ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup"" and corresponds to green.
- In example 2, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" and corresponds to yellow.
- In example 3, ""bluf"" is immediately preceded by ""zup"" and corresponds to yellow.
- In example 4, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and follows with ""zup"" corresponding to green.
- In example 5, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""zup,"" resulting in green.

From the information given, ""bluf"" yields either yellow or green. Identifying the rules for color output:
- ""zup"" seems to result in a yellow output except when immediately following ""dax.""
- ""lug"" gives a blue output.
- ""dax"" before ""zup"" results in a green output.
- ""wif"" gives a red output except when immediately followed by ""bluf,"" after which ""zup"" gives a green output.

Using the above observations, we can induce the following rule for ""bluf"":
- When ""bluf"" immediately follows ""dax"" or ""wif,"" and ""zup"" follows ""bluf,"" it results in a green output.
- In other contexts, ""bluf"" seems to mirror the color of the word it is most closely associated with (as seen with ""zup"").

However, the examples don't provide enough instances or variation to make a definitive conclusion. The nature of ""bluf"" remains somewhat ambiguous, but the most consistent association is that ""bluf"" seems to produce a green output when followed by ""zup"" in the presence of certain conditions (such as following ""dax"" or ""wif"").

Rule: Assuming the above-induced rules about other words and their colors are accurate, ""bluf"" could be associated with the following rule: When following ""dax"" or ""wif"" and if ""zup"" follows ""bluf,"" it results in a green output. Otherwise, it mirrors or blends with the output color of the closest related word, which is often ""zup"" (yielding yellow). However, more examples with varied contexts would be needed to confirm the rule for ""bluf.""",-1.162562271928,196,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we'll look at its relationship to the colors in the output. We have to understand the pattern that associates these words with the colors green, yellow, blue, and red. Here are the given examples with their corresponding outputs:

1. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
2. zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue
3. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
4. wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> red red yellow red blue green
5. lug dax bluf zup lug wif -> blue green green yellow blue red

We will look for patterns and correlations between the input words and the output colors, considering the positions and repetitions:

- ""zup"" correlates with yellow when it is preceded by ""bluf"" (examples 1, 4, 5) but not always when it comes before ""bluf"" (example 2).
- ""lug"" correlates with blue except when it is followed by ""bluf"" (example 4), in which case ""bluf"" also correlates with green (example 1, 4).
- ""dax"" correlates with green, whether or not it is followed by ""bluf"" (example 1, 5).
- ""wif"" correlates with red, whether or not it is followed by ""bluf"" (example 4).

Considering these patterns, the word ""bluf"" does not have a consistent color output that is independent of its context (i.e., it varies depending on adjacent words). However, in examples 1 and 4, where ""bluf"" directly follows ""dax"" and ""wif"" respectively, ""bluf"" adopts the green from ""dax"" and the red from ""wif."" Similarly, in examples 1 and 5, ""bluf"" yields green when it is between ""dax"" and ""zup.""

Hence, the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" seems to be that it mimics the color of the word before it:

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word.",-1.201124711728,196,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look at the position of ""bluf"" within the input and its corresponding color in the output.

In every example where ""bluf"" appears, the output color is ""yellow,"" regardless of the position of ""bluf."" This suggests that ""bluf"" has a consistent meaning that does not depend on its context within the string. 

Meanwhile, we can assess the surrounding words and their corresponding colors to see if there is any interaction affecting the color outcome:

1. ""dax bluf zup"" -> ""green green yellow""
   ""dax"" leads to ""green"" and ""bluf"" to ""yellow,"" whereas ""zup"" in this case leads to ""yellow.""

2. ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue""
   Here, ""lug"" results in ""blue"" every time. However, ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" when it precedes ""bluf"" but also independently of ""bluf.""

3. ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax"" -> ""red red yellow red blue green""
   The appearances of ""wif"" produce ""red,"" ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" The presence of ""bluf"" still corresponds with the color ""yellow.""

4. ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" -> ""blue green green yellow blue red""
   Consistent with the previous observations, we see ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red"". 

From these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" directly corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" and this meaning is stable across all the given examples.

Rule: bluf -> yellow",-1.59140434262,196,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" I'll look for patterns and differences in the input phrases and their corresponding output colors to identify any relations between ""bluf"" and the outputs.

- In examples 1 and 3, every time ""bluf"" appears, ""yellow"" follows.
- In example 2, ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow"", but so are all instances of ""zup.""
- In examples 4 and 5, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" but green also corresponds to ""dax"" in other instances.

Based on the above observations, there seems to be no direct one-to-one meaning that ""bluf"" can be assigned which is unique just to ""bluf"" as ""yellow"" and ""green"" correspond to other words as well. However, ""bluf"" never corresponds to ""blue"" or ""red."" 

Now, looking into how ""bluf"" affects the color sequence may offer another clue. When the sequences are compared against each other, it is noted that the color following ""bluf"" is the same as the color that followed the previous word that wasn't ""bluf.""

For instance, in example 1, ""dax"" is followed by ""green,"" and when ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is also ""green."" Similarly, in example 4, the sequence is ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax."" ""Wif"" is followed by ""red,"" ""bluf"" followed by ""red,"" ""zup"" by ""yellow,"" ""wif"" by ""red,"" ""lug"" by ""blue,"" and ""dax"" by ""green.""

By this pattern, it seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word just before it. To check this rule, we can look at example 5: ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif."" ""Lug"" has blue, ""dax"" green, and ""bluf"" then has green followed after ""dax."" ""Zup"" has a yellow, ""lug"" again blue, and ""wif"" ends with red. This example further supports the rule.

Given these observations, the assumption can be made for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""Bluf"" takes on the color of the previous word in the sequence. If ""bluf"" is the first word, it defaults to ""yellow,"" as seen in example 3.",-4.505260819400001,196,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the inputs and outputs provided:

- When the input is ""zup wif walm,"" the output is ""yellow red red red."" Here ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" seems to lead to three reds.
  
- When the input is ""dax walm zup walm,"" the output is ""green green green yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and each ""walm"" seems to triple the color that comes just before.

- When the input is ""dax walm wif walm zup,"" the output is ""green green green red red red yellow."" Again, ""dax"" leads to green, and ""wif"" leads to red. Each ""walm"" triples the color preceding it, while ""zup"" at the end gives a single yellow.

- When the input is ""dax lug walm,"" the output is ""green blue blue blue."" Here ""dax"" is green, ""lug"" is blue, and ""walm"" triples the blue.

- When the input is ""zup bluf lug zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here ""zup"" is yellow, ""bluf"" doesn't seem to have a corresponding color in the output, and ""lug"" is blue. The final ""walm"" triples the yellow that comes right before it. It seems that ""bluf"" may be irrelevant to the color output or ignored in this context.

Looking at these patterns, it looks like ""walm"" might be an instruction to triple the color that precedes it.

Rule: walm -> repeat the previous color three times.",-0.8362022784,196,walm
"Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" seems to correlate with a repetition of the color that follows its corresponding word. In each instance:

- ""zup wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow red red red.""
- ""dax walm zup walm"" corresponds to ""green green green yellow yellow yellow.""
- ""dax walm wif walm zup"" corresponds to ""green green green red red red yellow.""
- ""dax lug walm"" corresponds to ""green blue blue blue.""
- ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow.""

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the following word three times.

Therefore, the rule is:

walm -> Repeat the color of the following word three times.",-1.25556807792,196,walm
"walm -> four repetitions of the last color mentioned before walm.

- In the second example, ""zup"" is before the first ""walm"" and corresponds to yellow, resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" followed by ""dax"" which corresponds to green before the second ""walm,"" resulting in ""green green green.""

4. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

What we can observe from the examples is that ""walm"" seems to adopt the color that appears before it, except when it's at the start of the sequence or after ""wif"", in which case it adopts the color ""blue."" Here's how the rule seems to apply in each case: 

1. ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and in the output, the color ""blue"" is after ""lug,"" so ""walm"" becomes ""blue.""

2. ""walm"" is the second word; it follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow"" where it appears, so ""walm"" becomes ""yellow."" 

3. The first ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and becomes ""blue"" in the output. The second ""walm"" in the sequence follows ""lug"" and thus becomes ""blue"" as well.

4. ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and thus becomes ""yellow"" in the output.

5. ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and so it becomes ""blue"" in the output.

Furthermore, when ""walm"" directly follows ""wif"", it translates to ""blue"" consistently. Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" takes the color of the preceding word, with a default or fallback to ""blue"" when it follows ""wif"" or when no other color can be determined.

Rule: walm becomes the color of the word immediately before it in the sequence, with a default to ""blue"" if it follows ""wif"" or is at the start of the sequence.

So, based on the rule induction from the given examples:

walm -> meaning. Rule: walm becomes the color of the preceding word, with a default to ""blue"" if it follows ""wif"" or is at the start of the sequence.",-9.194037710505999,197,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to observe its usage and the associated output across the examples. Let's explore:

- In the first example, after ""walm,"" the color blue is repeated twice.
- In the second example, ""walm lug"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" which suggests that ""walm"" somehow repeats the color associated with ""lug"" (which is blue in other contexts).
- In the third example, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" and ""lug,"" and the corresponding output colors are red and blue. Considering ""lug"" usually corresponds to blue, ""walm"" here precedes a repetition of red, but this repetition started even before ""walm"" appears.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is directly followed by ""lug,"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" again indicating a repetition.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is followed by no other input but results in three consecutive blues, which suggests a pattern of repetition as well.

Additionally, we can notice that ""walm"" is never associated with a color of its own, but rather it seems to cause the repetition of the color word that follows it.

Now, let's construct the rule:

When the word ""walm"" appears, it seems to indicate that the color associated with the following word should be repeated twice, effectively tripling the appearance of that color. If ""walm"" is at the end of the input, it repeats the last color word mentioned. 

Rule: walm -> causes the next color to be repeated twice or triples the last mentioned color if it's the last word in the sequence.",-11.55215858812,197,walm

- In every instance where the word ""walm"" appears, the color ""blue"" is in the output, sometimes duplicated.
- When ""walm"" is after ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue.""
- When ""walm"" follows another word, except ""lug,"" it translates to a single ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it means ""blue,"" and when it follows ""lug,"" it causes the color ""blue"" to repeat.

- ""lug"" is followed by ""blue""
- ""wif"" is followed by ""red""
- ""dax lug wif"" is followed by ""green blue red""
- ""zup lug"" is followed by ""yellow blue""

Each of these color translations is directly followed by the word ""bluf"" in the input, which leads to the repetition of the last color word in the output.

Therefore, ""bluf"" operates under the rule of repeating the immediately preceding color translated from the input.

- When both are present and ""lug"" is immediately before ""bluf,"" as in ""dax lug wif bluf,"" only ""lug"" seems to affect ""bluf,"" giving the output ""blue red red,"" with the first ""red"" being the output of ""wif"" on its own.
- ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow.""

"To work out the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at each instance and its corresponding output. We're looking for a consistent pattern that could help us understand the rule underlying the use of ""walm.""

1. wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   red red green green red red red blue red

2. zup wif walm
   yellow red red red

3. zup wif walm
   yellow red red red

4. lug dax zup dax walm wif
   blue green yellow green green green red

5. dax walm
   green green green

From the examples, every time ""walm"" appears, it produces an output of three of the same color. The color repeated three times corresponds to the color that follows ""walm.""

- In the first example, after ""walm,"" the word ""lug"" appears, which corresponds to the color blue, and the output is ""red blue red."" We notice two things: the first color is red (which could be the default or stand-in color), then follows the blue (corresponding to ""lug""), and then red again.

- In the second and third examples, there are no words after ""walm,"" yet it maps to ""red red red,"" which suggests that the color red might be a default when ""walm"" is at the end.

- In the fourth example, ""walm"" precedes ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, and the output is ""green green red,"" which again matches the previous pattern with a three-color repetition ending in ""red.""

- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is at the end and is followed by three greens, indicating that the end position rule of defaulting to red doesn't always apply.

Based on these observations, we can deduce a rule associated with ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in a sequence, it seems to signal a repetition of the next color mentioned after it twice, followed by that color or an instance of the preceding color. If ""walm"" is at the end or if it is not followed by another color, the default color is red, which is repeated three times.

So: walm -> meaning. Meaning: ""Walm"" indicates that the next color word mentioned should be repeated twice, followed by that color or by the preceding color in the sequence.

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" causes repetition of the preceding color in the output. Here's the rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color translated from the word before ""walm"" for a series of three.

For instance:
- In the first input, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which translates to ""red,"" thus ""walm"" leads to ""red red red"".
- In the second and third inputs, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which translates to ""red"" once again, hence ""walm"" results in ""red red red"".
- In the fourth input, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" so ""walm"" generates ""green green green"".
- In the fifth input, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" therefore producing ""green green green"" again.

"Rule: ""walm"" -> repetition of the previous color stated once more than the number of times the last unique color was mentioned. 

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" ""Walm"" follows ""wif wif,"" where ""red"" is mentioned twice. Thus, ""walm"" results in ""red"" being repeated three times. 

- In the second and third examples, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" again. ""Walm"" follows a single instance of ""wif,"" so ""red"" is repeated twice after ""walm.""

- In the fourth example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" ""Walm"" follows ""dax dax,"" with ""green"" mentioned twice. Thus, ""walm"" results in ""green"" being repeated three times.

- In the fifth example, there's only ""dax"" before ""walm,"" hence ""green"" is mentioned once and is then repeated twice after ""walm.""",-9.709520955439999,198,walm

- In the first example ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"", ""wif"" translates to ""red"", and after ""walm"" the output is ""red red red"".
- In the second example ""zup wif walm"", ""wif"" translates to ""red"", and after ""walm"" the output is ""red red red"".
- In the fourth example ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"", ""dax"" translates to ""green"", and after ""walm"" the output is ""green green green"".

To assess this further, verify whether each following word correlates to the other colors in the same manner:

- ""lug"" consistently results in ""blue.""
- ""wif"" consistently yields ""red.""
- ""walm"" is always translated to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" maps to ""yellow.""

Given that ""wif"" and ""walm"" produce different colors in the examples (red and blue respectively), but then ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"", it suggests a possible pattern alteration when multiple words follow ""dax"". However, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" which indicates that ""walm"" might have a rule attached to it, such as repeating the color of the word it follows.

Thus, the rule could be:
- ""dax"" means ""green.""
- Each nonce word following ""dax"" has a corresponding color, except ""walm,"" which repeats the color of the word before it.

The inferred rules are as follows:
- dax -> green

- ""lug"" maps to ""blue""
- ""wif"" maps to ""red""
- ""walm"" also maps to ""blue"" based on the fourth example
- ""zup"" maps to ""yellow""

However, we see in the first example that ""walm"" follows the word ""wif"" and the output is ""red red red,"" which may suggest that the repeated color ""red"" is influenced by the word ""wif."" It could be the repetition of the word ""walm"" generates repeated output of the last color mentioned before it, which in this case is ""red"" from ""wif.""

- Input: zup bluf wif walm | Output: yellow yellow red red red
- Input: lug wif walm | Output: blue red red red
- Input: dax wif | Output: green red
- Input: wif lug | Output: red blue

Based on the examples:

1. When ""wif"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output is ""red green.""
2. When ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output starts with ""red"" and is followed by a repetition of ""red"" for ""walm.""
3. When ""wif"" precedes ""lug,"" the output starts with ""red"" and is followed by ""blue"" for ""lug.""
4. When ""wif"" is in the middle (zup bluf wif walm), we can see that ""wif"" does not influence the output for words before it (zup bluf), but it initiates a sequence starting with ""red"" for words following it.
5. When ""dax"" precedes ""wif,"" ""wif"" leads to ""red"" following the output for ""dax.""

From this analysis, it appears that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and may trigger a sequence of colors based on the subsequent words.

"Based on the provided examples, we need to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm.""

Let's analyze the examples and their corresponding outputs:

1. `dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax` -> green blue blue blue green red red green
2. `dax zup walm wif walm` -> green yellow yellow yellow red red red
3. `zup walm dax` -> yellow yellow yellow green
4. `zup wif dax walm lug` -> yellow red green green green blue
5. `wif dax zup walm` -> red green yellow yellow yellow

Looking at these sequences, we can make some observations:

- The word ""walm"" always precedes a sequence of ""yellow"" in the output.
- ""walm"" does not seem to have a fixed color output itself; the output color varies based on the word that comes after ""walm.""
- When ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"", the output is ""red red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" might change the subsequent word's color output to ""red"" and does not affect the color output of itself.
- When ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"", the output is ""yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" might be changing ""dax"" to output ""yellow"" instead of its regular color, ""green.""
- When ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"", as seen in example 4, ""lug"", which usually outputs ""blue"", is preceded by three ""green"" which suggests that ""walm"" might be creating a repetition effect (three ""green"" before ""blue"").
- ""walm"" on its own or at the end of a sequence has a yellow output (see examples 3 and 5).

Based on these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" serves as a modifier that affects the color output of the word that follows it. When ""walm"" is followed by another word, it changes the color output to ""yellow"" and may cause repetition of the color ""yellow"" depending on the following word. However, when ""walm"" is at the end of a sequence or does not have a specific word following it, the output is ""yellow.""

Rule: walm -> changes the color output of the following word to ""yellow,"" may cause the color ""yellow"" to repeat before other colors based on the following word, and outputs ""yellow"" when there is no specific word following it or it's at the end of a sequence.",-1.2809100927719999,199,walm
"To deduce the meaning or the rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to analyze the patterns in the given examples and correlate them with their outputs.

Observations from the examples:

1. ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax""
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   - Before the first occurrence of ""walm,"" we have ""dax lug,"" resulting in ""green blue.""
   - Right after ""walm,"" we have ""dax,"" which results in ""blue.""
   - ""Walm"" comes between ""lug"" and ""dax,"" and ""blue"" is repeated.

2. ""dax zup walm wif walm""
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   - After ""walm,"" the colors repeat (""yellow red"" sequence).

3. ""zup walm dax""
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   - After ""walm,"" ""dax"" results in green.

4. ""zup wif dax walm lug""
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   - ""Walm"" comes after ""dax,"" which is ""green."" The following color is also ""green.""

5. ""wif dax zup walm""
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   - After ""walm,"" the sequence continues with ""yellow.""

Looking at all examples, we can see that after ""walm,"" the color that follows is the same color that would have been assigned if ""walm"" were not there. So ""walm"" seems to repeat the color that would naturally follow from the previous word. It does not have a color of its own but instead causes a repetition of the next color in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm -> causes the next color to repeat.",-8.128592424111996,199,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's analyze the context in which it appears and the corresponding outputs.

In the first input, ""walm"" appears between ""lug"" and ""dax"" and the corresponding output is ""blue blue green."" ""Lug"" precedes ""walm"" and aligns with ""blue,"" and ""dax"" follows ""walm"" and aligns with ""green.""

In the second input, ""walm"" appears after ""zup"" and before ""wif"" and the output sequence is ""yellow yellow yellow red red red."" Here, ""walm"" is again associated with ""yellow.""

In the third input, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" with the output ""yellow yellow yellow."" Again, we see a correlation with ""walm"" and ""yellow.""

In the fourth input, ""walm"" is at the end after ""dax,"" and the outputs associated are ""green green green blue."" Since ""lug"" is the last word and correlates with ""blue,"" it's not clear what directly associates with ""walm"" here, but it follows ""dax"" which is ""green.""

In the fifth input, ""walm"" is after ""zup,"" with the output ""yellow yellow yellow.""

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" correlates with the repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. ""Walm"" does not seem to have a static color associated with it but appears to cause the repetition in sequence.

Thus, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the repeated output of the color associated with the preceding word.

walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the color associated with the word that comes right before it in the sequence.",-8.51688870622,199,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the examples given and look for patterns in the input-output pairs.

1. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   
2. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   
3. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   
4. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   
5. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

Let's investigate the position of ""walm"" relative to the colors it produces:

- In example 1, walm is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""dax."" The corresponding color sequence is blue blue blue.
- In example 2, ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""wif."" The corresponding color sequence is yellow yellow red. It's also noted that ""walm"" occurs twice, and the second time it is preceded by ""wif"" but not followed directly by a word, and the color sequence is red red.
- In example 3, ""walm"" is only followed by ""dax,"" and the color produced for ""walm"" is yellow yellow.
- In example 4, ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" and the sequence for ""dax walm"" is green green green.
- In example 5, ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" and the color sequence is yellow yellow yellow.

Based on this analysis, it seems that ""walm"" does not produce a specific fixed color but rather repeats the color of the word that precedes it, potentially with additional color effects if it is followed by a specific word. When ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" the output color red is produced once more beyond the repetition pattern. Without more examples, we can say that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color denoted by the preceding word, but the exact rule (including edge cases) cannot be fully determined from the given data. Any additional behaviors or effects of ""walm"" when combined with other words that are not in the examples cannot be concluded with certainty.

Rule: walm -> causes a repetition of the output color associated with the word that precedes it in the given input sequence. If ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" it adds an additional red.",-9.131681071251,199,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can try to find a connection between the input phrases and the corresponding output colors to deduce the meaning or rule for the word ""walm"".

Let's analyze the occurrences of ""walm"" and the colors associated with it:

1st Example:
- Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
- Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
  
2nd Example:
- Input: dax zup walm wif walm
- Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
  
3rd Example:
- Input: zup walm dax
- Output: yellow yellow yellow green
  
4th Example:
- Input: zup wif dax walm lug
- Output: yellow red green green green blue
  
5th Example:
- Input: wif dax zup walm
- Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

From these examples, we can observe the following:

- Every time ""walm"" is mentioned, the output is a sequence of the color yellow.
- ""walm"" affects not only its own output but also turns the color of the next word(s) into yellow, until a different word like ""dax"" or ""wif"" occurs, which has its own associated color (green for ""dax"" and red for ""wif"").
- The influence of ""walm"" persists over multiple words if they are not ""dax"" or ""wif"", which seems to reset the effect.

Based on these observations, we can derive a rule for the word ""walm"":

Rule: The word ""walm"" changes the color of its own output and continues to affect the following words by turning them into yellow, until it encounters a word that has its own predetermined color output.

So, the meaning of ""walm"" seems to be a modifier that influences the color output of itself and subsequent words until interrupted by a specific reset word.

Thus, we can write:

walm -> meaning: walm turns its own output and the following words' outputs to yellow until a reset word with its own color is encountered.",-9.136162158949999,199,walm
