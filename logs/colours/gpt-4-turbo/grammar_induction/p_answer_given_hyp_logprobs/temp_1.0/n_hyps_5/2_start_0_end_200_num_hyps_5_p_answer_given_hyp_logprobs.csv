"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
To determine what ""dax"" means, let's analyze the recurring patterns between the input and output.

Consider the input ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" and its corresponding output ""blue blue blue green red blue red"":
- The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red.""
- The word ""walm"" seems to appear before a color changes, potentially indicating ""walm"" corresponds to changing the color, leading to ""blue"" before ""green"" and ""red"" before ""blue.""

Now consider the input ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" and its output ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow"":
- The word ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red,"" as seen directly after ""dax.""
- The word ""walm"" appears before a color shift, reinforcing our above observation.
- The word ""zup"" directly correlates to a transition to the color ""yellow.""

Considering ""dax zup dax walm"":
- ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow,"" and after it, repeating colors of ""green"" follow.
- ""walm"" seems to set the next word (""dax"") to produce a run of ""green.""

""Input: wif dax"":
- ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and directly after it, ""dax"" is translated to ""green.""

""Input: zup lug wif dax lug"":
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and the ""dax"" following ""wif"" translates to ""green,"" same as in the previous examples.

Based on the inputs and outputs provided, whenever ""dax"" appears, it consistently translates to ""green,"" regardless of the position in the sequence or the preceding word. Also, ""dax"" does not seem to affect the following word's color, which means its meaning is independent and doesn't affect other elements in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce a pattern for the word ""wif"" and its resultant output color. Let's break it down example by example:

1. ""dax wif"" translates to ""green red"". Here, ""wif"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" itself gives ""red"".

2. ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" translates to ""green green green red blue green green green"". In this sequence, ""wif"" is followed by ""lug,"" and ""wif"" results in ""red,"" while ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

3. ""wif"" by itself translates to ""red"".

4. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" translates to ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"". In this case, ""wif"" appears after ""zup"" (which corresponds to ""yellow"") and before ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue""), and ""wif"" itself still translates to ""red"".

5. ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue"". Here ""wif"" precedes ""lug,"" and it still corresponds to ""red.""

Combining these observations leads to the straightforward rule:

Rule: wif -> red

In every instance, regardless of what precedes or follows ""wif,"" the output for ""wif"" is consistently ""red"". Thus, we can conclude that the meaning of ""wif"" is synonymous with ""red"" in the context of these examples.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Meaning: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the given examples.
Based on the provided examples:

- The first example shows that ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" which could suggest that ""bluf"" means ""yellow."" However, other examples contradict this.
- The second example ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green,"" which does not support ""bluf"" being ""yellow.""
- The third example ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" translates to ""blue red green green red blue,"" again indicating that ""bluf"" does not mean ""yellow.""
- The fourth example ""wif lug bluf"" translates to ""red blue blue,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" means ""blue."" 
- The final example ""lug bluf wif"" translates to ""blue blue red,"" further supporting the hypothesis that ""bluf"" means ""blue.""

Rule:

bluf -> blue.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" changes the output sequence to repeat the color code of the preceding word until a different non-""walm"" word occurs. To break down the pattern:

- ""zup walm wif"" turns into ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" where the word ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to repeat.
- ""wif dax zup walm"" yields ""red green yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and results in repeated ""yellow.""
- ""dax lug walm"" becomes ""green blue blue blue,"" with ""lug"" preceding ""walm"" causing a ""blue"" repetition.
- ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red,"" with ""walm"" first repeating ""yellow"" and later the sequence turns back to the normal pattern.
- ""dax walm wif walm zup"" produces ""green green green red red red yellow,"" where ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""wif"" respectively, each time causing the repetition of ""green"" and then ""red.""

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the preceding word to repeat until a different non-""walm"" word appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax
    ",Output: red green,red green,True,0
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's break down each input line by line and compare them with their outputs:

1. ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green yellow red green green""
2. ""dax wif walm"" -> ""green red red red""
3. ""zup dax"" -> ""yellow green""
4. ""dax bluf zup"" -> ""green green yellow""
5. ""dax wif lug"" -> ""green red blue""

From the examples given, we can try to match the word ""dax"" to a corresponding color in the output:

1. The second word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
2. The first word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
3. The second word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
4. The first word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
5. The first word ""dax"" also corresponds to ""green""

Based on these mappings, it appears that whenever ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, ""green"" is given in the output. This suggests a rule that ""dax"" represents the color ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green
Analyzing the inputs and outputs given:

- In example 1, ""wif lug dax"" corresponds to ""red blue green"", and ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow"". Since ""lug"" and ""dax"" correspond to ""blue"" and ""green"", respectively, it suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
  
- In example 2, ""dax walm wif"" corresponds to ""green green green red"". If ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and assuming that ""walm"" follows the same pattern (which we later see in example 4), then ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red"".
  
- In example 3, ""wif lug wif"" corresponds to ""red blue red"". With ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"", both instances of ""wif"" correspond to ""red"".

- In example 4, ""lug walm wif lug"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue red blue"". Again, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and based on the previous examples, ""wif"" must correspond to ""red"". ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word before it in this sequence.
  
- In example 5, ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red"". Since there is no previous word for ""walm"" to take the color of, it's reasonable to conclude that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

From these examples, it can be deduced that:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the provided outputs. Each instance of ""zup"" in the input results in ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided:

- The word ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green"".
- The word ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue"".
- The word ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow"".
- The word ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red"".

Notably, ""bluf"" seems to take on the color of the word that precedes it. If a word maps to a specific color, then ""bluf"" after that word also maps to the same color. For example, after ""dax"" (green), it becomes ""red"". After ""lug"" (blue), it becomes ""blue"". After ""wif"" (red), it becomes ""red"".

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word. If no word precedes it (if it's the first word), then it's not clear what color ""bluf"" would represent based on the given examples. However, since that situation has not occurred in the provided input-output pairs, we'll work within the scope of the examples where ""bluf"" always follows another word.
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word

Examining the given examples, the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color that immediately precedes it. Let's validate this rule with the given examples:

- Example 1: ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" -> yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
  Here, ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup"" which is yellow.

- Example 2: ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
  ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup"" which is yellow.

- Example 3: ""zup wif walm lug"" -> yellow red red red blue
  ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif"" which is red.

- Example 4: ""dax wif walm lug zup"" -> green red red red blue yellow
  ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif"" which is red.

- Example 5: ""zup walm"" -> yellow yellow yellow
  ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup"" which is yellow.

Based on the information provided, the rule for ""walm"" is consistent across all examples.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup
    ",Output: red yellow,red yellow,True,1
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" is included in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". It is consistent across all examples that whenever ""dax"" is mentioned, the output includes ""green"". Further examples give additional colors when ""dax"" is paired with another word, such as ""lug"" yielding blue or ""wif"" yielding red, but ""dax"" itself consistently corresponds to ""green"".
Observing the examples:

Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red  
Input: wif dax lug walm -> Output: red green blue blue blue  
Input: zup lug wif -> Output: yellow blue red  
Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red  
Input: wif dax zup -> Output: red green yellow  

In every output, the color ""red"" appears immediately after the word ""wif"" is used in the input. No matter what follows or precedes ""wif,"" the output consistently contains ""red"" in the position correlating to where ""wif"" was in the input.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output. The word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in every instance it appears:

- Input: zup -> Output: yellow
- Input: zup dax bluf -> Output: yellow green green
- Input: wif zup -> Output: red yellow
- Input: zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red
- Input: zup wif walm lug -> Output: yellow red red red blue

Therefore, the rule appears to be:
zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at each example and their corresponding outputs. We must attempt to correlate the appearances of ""bluf"" with the colors in the output.

1. ""dax bluf wif zup"" corresponds to ""green green red yellow""
2. ""wif bluf zup"" corresponds to ""red red yellow""
3. ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red red green blue blue""
4. ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue red blue blue""
5. ""wif bluf lug"" corresponds to ""red red blue""

Now, we look for a pattern. In the first and third examples, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" and ""dax"" respectively; both times it translates to ""red"". In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and also translates to ""red"". Lastly, in the second and fifth examples, ""bluf"" is immediately followed by ""zup"" and ""lug"", translating to ""red"" in both cases as well. 

Considering these observations, every instance of ""bluf"" correlates to the output ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> red
walm -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to cause the output to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it three times. 

Rule: When ""walm"" follows another word, it dictates that the color corresponding to that preceding word is repeated three times. If another word follows ""walm"", the pattern is interrupted, and the color associated with the new word is added to the sequence.

- ""dax walm"" becomes ""green green green"" because ""dax"" is associated with ""green"".
- ""wif walm"" becomes ""red red red"" because ""wif"" is associated with ""red"".
- ""zup walm"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"".
- ""dax walm zup"" includes both ""dax"" associated with ""green"" (repeated due to ""walm"") and ""zup"" associated with ""yellow"" (which follows ""walm"").
- ""zup walm lug"" includes ""zup"" associated with ""yellow"" (repeated due to ""walm"") and ""lug"" associated with ""blue"" (which follows ""walm"").

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,2
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the term ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" is outputted in the corresponding position in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" has an influence on the colors that follow it or precede it in a sequence and the particular influence is that it changes the color to the next one in a specific pattern or 'color order'. To decipher the rule, let's observe the patterns:

- When ""dax"" precedes a word, the following colors appear to shift in a certain ordered sequence, one step for each instance of the word.
- When ""dax"" follows a word, the color associated with ""dax"" changes to the next color in the sequence after the color associated with the word before it.

Assuming the ordered color sequence based on the given examples is: red, blue, green, yellow, let's see if our observations hold up:

1. dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" should give red, but ""dax"" before it changes ""wif"" to green. 
   - ""walm"" should give green, after ""dax"" it stays green because ""dax"" is already accounted for.
   - ""lug"" should give blue, but since ""dax"" is still influencing, ""lug"" goes one step back to red.
   - ""zup"" should give yellow, but with ""dax"" is influencing, it goes to blue.
   - Another ""walm"" normally would be green, but the preceding ""zup"" without ""dax"" influence yields yellow.

2. dax walm -> green green green
   - Normally, ""walm"" should give green, but since ""dax"" comes first, it stays green and repeats three times.

3. dax lug -> green blue
   - Normally, ""lug"" should give blue, but ""dax"" changes it to green and ""lug"" after ""dax"" is blue as expected.

4. lug dax -> blue green
   - Normally, ""lug"" gives blue, and ""dax"" after should give green because it follows ""lug.""

5. zup bluf wif dax lug -> yellow yellow red green blue
   - ""zup"" normally gives yellow, ""bluf"" has no given color, but if we infer it repeats the color of the word before, then it's also yellow. But if ""bluf"" is irrelevant or has no color associated with it, the repeated yellow is due to ""zup.""
   - ""wif"" without ""dax"" influence gives red.
   - ""dax"" preceded by ""wif"" gives green.
   - ""lug"" follows ""dax""; thus, it gives blue.

From these patterns, ""dax"" seems to serve as a modifier that changes the color output of words based on their normal color sequence. However, the influence of ""dax"" appears to apply differently depending on its position (before or after a keyword). It either repeats the color (if it comes first) or shifts to the next color in the sequence (if it comes after another word).

Rule: ""dax"" is a modifier that affects the color sequence of the words that it accompanies. When placed before another word, it restarts the color sequence associated with the word to follow the color pattern starting from green. When placed after a word, ""dax"" assumes the next color in the sequence of the word before it.

dax -> a modifier that affects color sequences; when leading, it sets the color pattern starting at green, and when following, it takes the next color in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's look at what the output has in common each time ""wif"" appears:

1. After ""wif lug,"" the output is ""red blue"". ""Lug"" is mapped to ""blue"" coming after ""red.""
2. After ""zup wif,"" the output is ""yellow red"". ""Zup"" is mapped to ""yellow"", followed by ""red.""
3. After ""zup walm wif,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow red"". Both ""zup"" and ""walm"" map to ""yellow"", each repeated for their occurrences before ""red.""
4. After ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif,"" the output is ""blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red"". Each word maps to a color (""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""walm"" to ""yellow,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow"") and ""red"" follows the pattern after the appearance of ""wif.""
5. After ""dax zup walm wif,"" the output is ""green yellow yellow yellow red"". ""Dax"" maps to ""green,"" ""zup"" and ""walm"" both map to ""yellow,"" followed by ""red.""

What is consistent here is that regardless of the preceding words, the appearance of ""wif"" always results in ""red"" appearing immediately after the colors that correspond to the preceding words.

Rule: wif -> The presence of the word ""wif"" in the input stream indicates that a ""red"" should immediately follow in the output after the sequence of colors corresponding to the preceding words.
zup -> yellow. Rule: Whenever the word 'zup' is given as input, the output is the color 'yellow'.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at the association between the input and the output in each example:

- When ""zup"" (input) is present with ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow."" This suggests that ""bluf"" might be associated with the color ""yellow"" when ""zup"" is present.
  
- However, when ""dax"" (input) is present with ""bluf,"" the output is ""green red red."" This changes the association, as ""bluf"" is no longer producing the color ""yellow."" Instead, it produces two instances of the color ""red.""

- The same goes for ""zup dax bluf"" resulting in ""yellow green green."" The presence of ""dax"" and ""bluf"" leads to two greens.

- With ""zup wif bluf,"" the output is ""yellow red red,"" which establishes a pattern that ""bluf"" might be contributing to producing two instances of the preceding color.

- Finally, ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" produces ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue."" We can see here that ""bluf"" results in a double ""yellow,"" which is consistent with the previous pattern that ""bluf"" duplicates the preceding color.

By examining these patterns, we can conclude that ""bluf"" causes the duplication of the color associated with the word that directly precedes it in the input.

Rule: bluf -> duplicated color of the preceding word.
Based on the given examples, we can determine that 'walm' causes the output color to be repeated three times following the color that corresponds to the word immediately prior to 'walm'. This pattern holds true across all given examples. Hence we can deduce that 'walm' is an instruction to repeat the preceding color three times.

Here is the pattern distilled from the examples:

- ""lug walm zup"" outputs ""blue blue blue yellow,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times.
- ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times.
- ""lug wif dax walm zup"" outputs ""blue red green green green yellow,"" where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated three times.
- ""lug zup walm lug"" outputs ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated three times.
- ""zup walm wif"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color name to be outputted three times in a row.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax bluf
    ",Output: red green green,red green green,True,3
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color blue in the given examples.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that words are consistently being translated into specific color names. The direct translation of the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color:

- Every instance of ""wif"" results in ""red.""
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

There does not seem to be any additional context or conditions that change what each nonce word means. Therefore, the rule here is quite straightforward:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, I will infer the meaning of ""zup"" by examining its correlation with the output colors.

Example 1:
- Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
- Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

In this example, ""zup"" is associated with a green output.

Example 2:
- Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
- Output: yellow green yellow green red red

Here, ""zup"" appears twice and both times it is associated with a yellow output that precedes a green output (""dax"").

Example 3:
- Input: lug zup dax wif
- Output: blue yellow green red

""Zup"" is associated with a yellow output following blue, which is for ""lug.""

Example 4:
- Input: zup
- Output: yellow

""Zup"" alone gives us a yellow output.

Example 5:
- Input: zup dax walm zup wif
- Output: yellow green green green yellow red

Both occurrences of ""zup"" are associated with yellow. 

From the examples given, it appears that regardless of its position or the words around it, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output color yellow. Therefore, we can deduce that ""zup"" means ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" triggers the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word. If we match the input words with the output colors:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- walm -> red (since its repetition suggests a single color associated with it)
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green

We see that the appearance of ""bluf"" after any of these words results in the color linked to that word being repeated once. Here are the rules visible from the examples:

- ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue""
- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red""
- ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow""

It seems that ""bluf"" causes the duplication of the color word that precedes it. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the previous word.
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to generate a sequence of colors that starts with the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" This sequence continues for a number of times that equals the position of the word that precedes ""walm."" The sequence comprises repetitions of the color equivalent to that preceding word.

To put it in clearer terms:

1. The color corresponding to the word right before ""walm"" repeats.
2. The repetition count is equal to the position of the word that comes before ""walm,"" with the first word being position 1.

Let’s analyze the examples to test this rule:

- Example 1: ""lug zup walm lug"" converts to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" ""Zup"" (yellow) is the word before ""walm"" and its position is 2, hence there are two repetitions of yellow.
- Example 2: ""lug wif dax zup walm"" converts to ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" (yellow) is the word before ""walm"" and its position is 4, hence there are four repetitions of yellow.
- Example 3: ""dax walm"" converts to ""green green green."" ""Dax"" (green) is the word before ""walm"" and its position is 1, hence there is one repetition of green.
- Example 4: ""zup wif walm"" converts to ""yellow red red red."" ""Wif"" (red) is the word before ""walm"" and its position is 2, hence there are two repetitions of red.
- Example 5: ""dax zup walm wif walm"" converts to ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red."" The first ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) at position 2, reaching to three repetitions of yellow, and the second ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) at position 5 (because ""walm"" is not counted when determining the position), thus there are five instances of red.

Considering this, the rule for ""walm"" could be stated as follows:

Rule: The meaning of ""walm"" depends on the color of the word right before it and the position of that word. ""Walm"" generates a series of that color, and the number of repetitions equals the position of the word right before ""walm"" in the input sequence. ""Walm"" itself is not counted in the position numbering.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Input: lug walm dax zup
    ",Output: blue blue blue green yellow,blue blue blue green yellow,True,4
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Rule: dax -> green

Justification: In every example where the word ""dax"" appears, the output associated with it is ""green."" Regardless of its position in the input or the words surrounding it, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"", regardless of the other words present. Hence, the rule seems to be:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears as an input, the output always includes ""red"".
zup -> yellow
Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to result in the output color being the same as the color indicated by the word immediately preceding it. Here are the observations that lead to this conclusion:

- In the first example, ""zup lug zup bluf lug,"" the output is ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue."" The word ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow,"" matching the color that comes before it.
- In the second example, ""lug wif bluf,"" the output is ""blue red red."" The word ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""red,"" again matching the color that comes before it.
- Similar patterns can be observed in all the other examples.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it takes the meaning (color) of the word that is immediately before it in the input sequence.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is the color indicated by the word immediately preceding it.
walm -> meaning. The meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" seems to indicate a repetition of the last color mentioned before it, repeated as many times as the number of syllables in the nonce word preceding it.

Rule:
- ""walm"" follows a pattern where it takes the last color word used right before it and then repeats that color word the same number of times as the syllables in the previous nonce word leading up to it.
- ""lug"" outputs ""blue,"" ""wif"" outputs ""red,"" ""zup"" outputs ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" outputs ""green.""
- The amount of repetition for ""walm"" is determined by the number of syllables in the previous word: ""lug"" (one syllable) leads to a single repetition of ""blue"" with ""walm""; ""zup"" (one syllable) leads to a single repetition of ""yellow"" with ""walm""; and ""dax"" (one syllable) leads to a single repetition of ""green"" with ""walm.""

Thus, ""lug walm"" produces ""blue blue blue"" since ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"" and has one syllable, hence ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" produces ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue""—after ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" we see ""walm,"" and since ""zup"" has one syllable, ""yellow"" is repeated three times. This pattern continues consistently through all provided examples.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Input: dax zup dax zup
    ",Output: green yellow green yellow,green yellow green yellow,True,5
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word 'lug' corresponds to the color blue.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to look for consistent patterns in its use across the different examples. Let's break down the examples provided:

1. The word ""dax"" precedes the color ""green"" in all instances.
2. The word ""lug"" is followed by ""blue.""
3. The word ""wif"" is followed by ""red.""
4. The word ""walm"" is followed by ""red.""
5. The word ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow.""

Now, let's analyze the patterns:

- In the first example, ""dax lug wif walm"" translates to ""green blue red red red,"" with ""dax"" directly mapping to ""green.""

- In the second example, ""dax zup dax"" translates to ""green yellow green,"" again showing ""dax"" mapping to ""green.""

- In the third example, ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" and the translation ""green green red yellow green"" indicates that ""dax"" is consistently translated to ""green,"" regardless of the position or the surrounding words.

- In the fourth example, ""zup walm dax,"" the ""dax"" at the end of the sequence translates to ""green"" once again.

- In the fifth example, ""zup dax,"" the translation ""yellow green"" further confirms ""dax"" as ""green"" since ""zup"" is consistently ""yellow.""

Considering each example, it's evident that the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" translates to ""red."" Regardless of the context provided, whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" appears at the beginning of the output. Here is the interpretation based on the examples:

- wif zup lug zup lug -> red yellow blue yellow blue means that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
- wif -> red indicates that ""wif"" alone translates to ""red.""
- wif lug -> red blue shows that ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""lug"" is ""blue.""
- wif lug -> red blue reaffirms that ""wif"" means ""red"" and ""lug"" means ""blue.""
- wif zup walm dax zup -> red yellow yellow yellow green yellow suggests that ""wif"" means ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""walm"" stands for an unspecified color which is repeated three times (presumably indicating that ""walm"" means ""yellow"" here), ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and then ""zup"" is ""yellow"" again.

Rule:
- wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it seems that each nonce word (including ""zup"") translates to a particular color. To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze the pattern of color outputs relative to the input words provided in the examples:

1. ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
2. ""walm"" consistently translates to ""red.""
3. ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
4. ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
5. ""bluf"" consistently translates to either ""red"" or ""blue,"" but since ""lug"" already means ""blue,"" ""bluf"" likely means ""red."" (The examples given do not show ""bluf"" meaning ""blue."")

Focusing on the word ""zup,"" we see the following patterns:

- Whenever ""zup"" appears, ""yellow"" is in the output.
- ""zup"" does not seem to depend on its position in the input for its corresponding output color.

Based on these observations, it seems that the meaning of ""zup"" is consistently translated to ""yellow,"" regardless of its position or other words in the sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, each nonce word seems to correspond to a specific color in the output. To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should find a consistent pattern associated with its occurrence and the resulting color in the output:

1. zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
2. dax bluf wif zup wif -> green green red yellow red
3. dax zup lug zup bluf -> green yellow blue yellow yellow
4. wif bluf dax lug -> red red green blue
5. dax zup wif bluf lug -> green yellow red red blue

Looking at these examples, every time the word ""bluf"" appears, the corresponding color in the output is ""red."" It does not appear to depend on context or the position in the sequence of words. Thus, the rule we can induce for the meaning of ""bluf"" is that it translates directly to the color red.

Rule: bluf -> red
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns before and after its appearance in the given examples:

1. `dax walm wif lug dax walm` -> `green green green red blue green green green`
2. `dax walm wif zup` -> `green green green red yellow`
3. `dax lug walm zup wif` -> `green blue blue blue yellow red`
4. `zup wif walm` -> `yellow red red red`
5. `lug walm dax` -> `blue blue blue green`

Observations:
- In each instance where ""walm"" appears, the color following ""walm"" is not green (1: red, 2: red, 3: blue, 4: red, 5: blue).
- The colors red and blue repeat after ""walm,"" but they do not seem to be exclusively tied to any particular word before ""walm.""
- In the first example, ""dax walm"" is followed by green, but that's not consistent in other examples; therefore, it is not directly about the word before ""walm.""
- After ""walm,"" the color pattern seems to restart counting with the color that follows ""walm."" For example, in the first input, after ""walm,"" the pattern skips to blue and then resumes with green, as if ""walm"" causes a reset or skip in the sequence.
- The color right after ""walm"" isn't a consistent reset to the first color in the sequence (which is green); instead, it seems to be different dependent on context (sometimes red, sometimes blue).

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color sequence to change or reset. However, without a consistent rule for the color that appears right after ""walm,"" it's difficult to pinpoint exactly how ""walm"" affects the color sequence.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" could be that it represents a disruption or modification to the expected sequence, but the specific nature of this disruption isn't clear from the provided examples. We would need more data to determine a consistent way ""walm"" modifies the color sequence following it.

Rule: walm -> represents a disruption or modification to the usual sequence of colors, but the exact effect requires further examples to clarify.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" is associated with the color blue. In each input where ""lug"" is present, the corresponding output includes the word ""blue."" Additionally, it does not change based on position within the input sequence, which suggests that ""lug"" consistently means the color blue regardless of its placement with other words.

Rule: lug -> blue.
From the examples provided, it seems that each word is associated with a specific color. The color outputted corresponds to the word that is inputted.

- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Thus, the rule we can induce from this is that each nonce word represents a specific color, regardless of the position of the word in the input.

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the output is ""yellow.""
Based on the provided examples, we can infer that the word ""bluf"" triggers the repetition of the color that precedes it. Looking at the patterns, ""bluf"" causes the color before it to be repeated in the output sequence. 

For example, in the first input:

- ""wif lug bluf"" the word ""lug"" which stands for the color blue is followed by ""bluf"", which causes ""blue"" to be repeated in the output.
- In ""zup bluf"", the word ""zup"" which corresponds to the color yellow is immediately before ""bluf"", and yellow is repeated in the output.

To illustrate this rule clearly, below are the inputs with annotations:

- Input: wif (red) lug (blue) bluf (blue) zup (yellow) bluf (yellow) dax (green)
- Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green

- Input: lug (blue) wif (red) bluf (red) dax (green) lug (blue) bluf (blue)
- Output: blue red red green blue blue

- Input: zup (yellow) bluf (yellow)
- Output: yellow yellow

- Input: zup (yellow) lug (blue) zup (yellow) walm (yellow) dax (green) wif (red) bluf (red)
- Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

- Input: zup (yellow) dax (green) bluf (green) wif (red) zup (yellow) bluf (yellow) lug (blue)
- Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

Based on the examples provided and the analysis, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> Causes the preceding color to be repeated in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the relationship between the input and output strings. Here are the corresponding colors for words that appear in the input:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- bluf -> red

Now we look for a pattern for ""walm"":

1. ""zup lug walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue""
2. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""
3. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red""
4. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red""

Analyzing each instance of ""walm"" in the output:

1. It is followed by a repetition of the last color mentioned before it thrice.
2. It is followed by a repetition of the last color mentioned before it thrice.
3. It is followed by a repetition of the last color mentioned before it thrice.
4. It is followed by a repetition of the last color mentioned before it thrice.
5. It is followed by a repetition of the last color mentioned before it thrice.

Based on these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" indicates the repetition of the last color mentioned prior to ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last color mentioned prior to ""walm"" three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the outputs provided.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" seems to always correspond to the color red in the output, irrespective of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. Each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. For example:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" and ""bluf"" are not directly explained, but their presence doesn't affect the output for ""wif"", which is consistently ""red"".
  
Therefore, the rule is: wif -> red

Rule: ""wif"" consistently means ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the provided examples, we can observe the following patterns:

- wif bluf -> red red
- zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
- dax bluf -> green green
- lug bluf -> blue blue
- dax bluf -> green green

The output always repeats a color twice. Therefore, the word ""bluf"" seems to dictate that the output color should be repeated. Moreover, the color repeated seems to correspond to the color typically associated with the first word in the input:

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue

The first word defines the color, and ""bluf"" triggers the duplication of that color in the output. 

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the first word in the input.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to taking the color associated with the preceding word and repeating it. In each example, when ""walm"" follows a word, the output color is the same as the color associated with the word that precedes ""walm"". Here are the derivations for support:

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   - ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"", meaning ""walm"" takes the color of ""lug"" (blue) and repeats it.

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"", meaning ""walm"" takes the color of ""zup"" (yellow) and repeats it.

3. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup walm"" again results in ""yellow yellow yellow"", following the same pattern.

4. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red
   - ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"", consistent with previous examples.

5. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   - ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" and ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"", both cases showing ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it.

Given these patterns, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, it repeats the output color associated with the preceding word. 

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" can be stated as:

walm -> meaning: Repeating the color associated with the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. 

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples given, it seems that each unique word corresponds to a unique color:

- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green

Therefore, regardless of the word's position or its context in a sequence, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green. Here is the rule:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided and the consistency of output for each unique input, we can deduce the following color association with each word:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red

Therefore, regardless of position or occurrence, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" in the input corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
After analyzing the given examples, it seems clear that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" when it follows the word ""wif,"" and to the color ""yellow"" when it follows the word ""zup."" Let's look at each input and its corresponding output to deduce this pattern:

1. zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green
   Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the color is green, but since dax is also green, this example is not sufficient on its own.

2. wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the color is yellow.

3. wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   The first ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and is red; the second ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and is green, but since ""dax"" is also related to the color green, this further confirms the rule.

4. wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green
   ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and is red.

5. zup bluf wif dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow red green blue
   ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and is yellow.

The rules that can be deduced are as follows:
- ""bluf"" is red if it directly follows ""wif"".
- ""bluf"" changes to yellow if it follows ""zup"".

However, we also need to account for the instance where ""bluf"" is green after ""dax"". This seems to align with the color assigned to ""dax"", suggesting that ""bluf"" may also take on the color of the word before it under certain conditions. Based on the examples, though, the rules for ""wif"" and ""zup"" take precedence, so we will focus on those.

Rule: 
- bluf -> ""red"" when following ""wif"".
- bluf -> ""yellow"" when following ""zup"".
Rule: walm means to repeat the color associated with the word that comes before it, three times. 

- In ""dax walm"", dax is associated with the color green, so walm means ""green green green"".
- In ""wif walm"", wif is associated with the color red, so walm means ""red red red"".
- In ""zup walm"", zup is associated with the color yellow, so walm means ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In ""wif walm zup walm"", wif is red, followed by ""walm"" which repeats red three times, and zup is yellow, followed by ""walm"" which repeats yellow three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Rule:

Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" translates to the word ""blue.""

- ""lug dax"" results in ""blue green,"" suggesting that ""lug"" means ""blue,"" and ""dax"" means ""green.""
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""lug"" is ""blue,"" while ""walm"" is repeated as ""blue"" two more times.
- The standalone input ""lug"" simply outputs ""blue.""
- ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue,"" with ""wif"" meaning ""red"" and ""lug"" meaning ""blue.""
- In ""wif walm zup lug zup walm,"" we can deduce that ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" later translates to ""blue,"" confirming that ""lug"" is ""blue."" Since ""zup"" follows ""lug"" directly, generating a sequence of ""yellow"" outputs, we can reason that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" though we also notice that it does not translate one-to-one, potentially meaning ""repeat the previous color.""

Therefore, the rule for ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue in this context.
Rule: dax -> green

The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in all the given examples.
Based on the given examples, it seems that each unique word corresponds to a unique color. The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. The other words in the examples, ""dax"", ""lug"", ""walm"", ""bluf"", and ""zup,"" correspond to ""green"", ""blue"", ""green"", ""red"", and ""yellow"", respectively.

Rule:
wif -> red
dax -> green
lug -> blue
walm -> green
bluf -> red
zup -> yellow

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" appears to be that it translates to the color ""red.""
Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the examples provided, every time the word zup is used, the output includes the color yellow. The position of zup in the input does not appear to change its association with the color yellow. Other words in the input correspond to other colors, and the word wif consistently relates to the color red, while dax is associated with green. The word lug has only been used once and is associated with the color blue in the output. However, given that wif and dax are consistently related to their respective colors, we can speculate that lug is likely to consistently correlate with blue.
bluf -> meaning. The meaning of bluf seems to be dependent on the word that precedes it. Analyzing the examples provided:

- When 'lug' precedes 'bluf', the output is ""blue blue"".
- When 'dax' precedes 'bluf', the output is ""green green"".
- When 'zup' precedes 'bluf', the output is ""yellow green"".

We do not have examples where 'bluf' is preceded by 'walm' or 'wif', but we do know the word following these terms in the provided examples ('lug') leads to the output of ""blue"". Also, 'lug' by itself translates to ""blue"", so we cannot confidently conclude the rule for 'bluf' when these words precede it.

From the given examples, the rule seems to be that 'bluf' reproduces the color associated with the word just before it, but it appears twice. If 'bluf' stands alone without a precedent, there is not enough information to predict its meaning.

Rule: When a word precedes 'bluf', the output is the color associated with that word repeated twice. If 'bluf' is standalone, the rule is inconclusive based on available examples.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to correlate with the color green in the outputs. However, it's important to notice how the number of repetitions of the color green in the output corresponds to the position of ""walm"" in the input: the later ""walm"" appears, the more repeated green colors it generates.

Let's consider each example:

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
- ""walm"" is the second word, generates one green.

Input: dax zup walm wif
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
- ""walm"" is the third word, generates one green.

Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green
- ""walm"" is the fourth and last word, generates three greens.

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
- ""walm"" is again the fourth and last word, generates three greens.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""walm"" is the second word, generates one yellow which matches the color for ""zup"".

From the examples above, the rule for ""walm"" is that it generates a sequence of green colors in the output. The sequence's length is equal to its position in the sequence of the input (minus one because the first position generates one green, not zero). However, there is an exception when ""walm"" is the second word where it doesn't generate green but instead the color that corresponds to ""zup"".

Rule: When ""walm"" is in the second position of the input, it seems to duplicate the output color for ""zup"". When it's in any other position, ""walm"" generates a sequence of the color green, with the number of greens equal to its position minus one.

Given the inconsistency in behavior when ""walm"" is at the second position, the rule might need refinement with more data, but this is the best understanding given the current examples.

walm -> When in the second position, it duplicates the output color associated with ""zup""; otherwise generates green(s) in quantity one less than its input position.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,10
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. The examples provided consistently replace the word ""lug"" with the color ""blue"". 

Rule: ""lug"" means ""blue"".
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, wif appears at the end of each input sequence, and the word red follows at the end of each corresponding output sequence. Hence, it seems that the word ""wif"" translates directly to the color ""red.""

So the rule we can deduce is:

wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
Based on the given input and output pairs, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to a specific color depending on the context in which it is used. To deduce the rule for ""bluf"", let's analyze the outputs where ""bluf"" is present:

1. wif zup dax bluf -> red yellow green green
2. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue
3. dax bluf wif zup dax -> green green red yellow green
4. lug dax bluf wif dax -> blue green green red green
5. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red

Let's look for patterns based on known words:

- ""wif"" is always followed by red
- ""dax"" is always followed by green
- ""zup"" is always followed by yellow
- ""lug"" is always followed by blue

In all cases, ""bluf"" follows a color output that is repeated right after, suggesting that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes it. To confirm this rule, let's verify that in each instance, the color before and after ""bluf"" is the same:

1. green (dax) - green (bluf)
2. red (wif) - red (bluf)
3. green (dax) - green (bluf)
4. green (dax) - green (bluf)
5. yellow (zup) - yellow (bluf)

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" can be stated as:

Rule: bluf -> The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it.
Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following pattern between the input and output:

1. Each input word corresponds to a color in the output.
2. The color remains consistent for the same input word across different examples.

Let's analyze the colors associated with known words and then deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow""

By process of elimination, we can notice that ""walm"" always corresponds to ""red"". However, ""wif"" also corresponds to ""red"". So, we have to differentiate between the two:

- ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" in every instance where both words appear, except in the third example where ""walm"" appears alone but still translates to ""red"".
- When ""walm"" appears, it is always followed by at least one ""red"" in the output, whether ""wif"" is present or not.

From this, we can induce that ""walm"" changes the color of the following word(s) to red or it may also be interpreted as ""walm"" meaning ""red"". If a word that already corresponds to ""red"" follows ""walm"", such as ""wif"", this rule still applies, but there is no noticeable change in the output because the color remains consistent.

Therefore, the rule can be summarized as:

Rule: walm -> the following word(s) are red (or simply, walm means red).

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" maps directly to a color in the output. To determine the rule, we should look at the corresponding colors for ""dax"" and any patterns associated with other nonces (if any).

1. Input: lug dax --> Output: blue green
2. Input: lug dax wif lug --> Output: blue green red blue
3. Input: zup dax bluf --> Output: yellow green green
4. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm --> Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
5. Input: dax bluf --> Output: green green

In each instance, regardless of context or position, ""dax"" is consistently translated to ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" is used in the input, the color ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif -> red

In addition:
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" when it follows ""wif.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green"" when they follow ""wif.""

It seems that ""wif"" consistently means ""red,"" while other words represent different colors which can be influenced by their position or the preceding words.
Based on the input and output examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning, or rule, for the nonce word ""zup"". 

By looking at the consistent pairings between the input and output, we can see that whenever ""zup"" appears on its own or as part of a sequence, the output is always ""yellow"". ""Zup"" by itself does not appear to change meaning based on position or surrounding words since it consistently translates to ""yellow"" no matter where it is placed.

Here's a breakdown of each input and what we can infer about ""zup"":

1. Input: ""zup"" by itself.
   Output: ""yellow""
   Inference: ""zup"" means ""yellow"".

2. Input: ""lug walm zup lug zup wif""
   Output: ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red""
   Inference: Whenever ""zup"" appears, it translates to ""yellow"". Other words must have their own meanings (e.g., ""lug"" -> ""blue"", ""wif"" -> ""red"").

3. Input: ""zup"" by itself again.
   Output: ""yellow""
   Inference: This reinforces that ""zup"" means ""yellow"".

4. Input: ""dax zup""
   Output: ""green yellow""
   Inference: ""Dax"" is the first word and ""zup"" follows, meaning ""zup"" keeps its meaning as ""yellow"". ""Dax"" must mean ""green"".

5. Input: ""zup dax lug walm zup lug""
   Output: ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue""
   Inference: Again, each occurrence of ""zup"" results in ""yellow"", which reinforces the association between ""zup"" and ""yellow"".

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule for the nonce word ""zup"":

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Rule: bluf -> the color repeated from the previous word in the sequence. If there is no previous color, then ""bluf"" equals ""blue"". 

Explanation:

- ""wif zup bluf lug"" gives us ""red yellow yellow blue"". Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", which is ""yellow"", so ""bluf"" means ""yellow"".
- ""wif bluf lug"" gives us ""red red blue"". Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", which is ""red"", so ""bluf"" means ""red"".
- ""dax wif bluf"" gives us ""green red red"". Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", which is ""red"", so ""bluf"" means ""red"".
- ""zup bluf"" gives us ""yellow yellow"". Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", which is ""yellow"", so ""bluf"" means ""yellow"".
- ""zup lug bluf"" gives us ""yellow blue blue"". In this sequence, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", which is ""blue"", so ""bluf"" means ""blue"".

In the cases where ""bluf"" directly follows a colored word, it takes on the same color. When ""bluf"" is first in the sequence with no preceding color, as seen in ""wif zup bluf lug"" where ""bluf"" would normally be the third word, ""bluf"" defaults to the color ""blue"".
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to identify the patterns associated with its occurrence in the provided examples. The context in which ""walm"" is used will help determine its rule.

Considering the output for each input that contains ""walm,"" it appears that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color that immediately precedes it. Let's break it down:

- Example 1: ""dax wif walm"" outputs ""green red red red."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and the output is three additional ""red.""
- Example 2: ""zup bluf wif walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow red red red."" Again, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" resulting in three ""red.""
- Example 3: The sequence ""zup walm"" produced ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""walm"" repeated the color associated with ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" two more times.
- Example 4: The input ""lug wif zup wif walm"" has an output of ""blue red yellow red red red,"" and here ""walm"" repeats the color for ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" three times.
- Example 5: ""wif bluf dax walm"" outputs ""red red green green green."" After ""dax,"" which correlates to ""green,"" ""walm"" produces three ""green.""

Based on these observations, ""walm"" seems to triple the color that comes immediately before it in the input. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be defined as:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color name three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,12
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""lug."" To determine the pattern, let's look at the context in which ""lug"" appears and the corresponding output for each example:

1. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
2. Input: lug bluf dax bluf
   Output: blue blue green green
3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
4. Input: lug
   Output: blue
5. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green

In examples 2, 3, and 4, we see that ""lug"" directly translates to ""blue"" in the output, confirming that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Looking at example 1, ""lug"" is also followed by ""blue"" in the output. Again in example 5, ""lug"" maps to ""blue"" in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to an output of ""green."" In the second, third, and fourth examples, the word ""zup"" consistently generates the output ""yellow,"" indicating that ""zup"" might be associated with ""yellow."" The word ""lug,"" when paired with ""dax"" in the third and fifth examples, always corresponds to the output ""blue,"" which suggests that it may be associated with the color ""blue."" When ""wif"" appears in the fourth example, there's an output of ""red,"" which is not present when ""wif"" is not in the input. The color outputs seem to correspond to presence and order of these nonce words in the input.

So the rule seems to be:
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""wif"" -> red

Rule: The output color corresponds directly to the presence of a specific nonce word, and the order of colors in the output follows the order of the nonce words in the input.
From the examples provided, it can be deduced that the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" Whether ""wif"" appears at the beginning, middle, or end of the input sequence, the output always includes ""red"" in the position corresponding to where ""wif"" appeared in the input.

Here are the associations in each example:

Input: zup walm lug wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
""wif"" is in the last position and ""red"" is the last in the output.

Input: lug wif dax walm zup -> Output: blue red green green yellow
""wif"" is in the second position and ""red"" is the second in the output.

Input: wif -> Output: red
""wif"" is the sole word and ""red"" is the sole color in the output.

Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
""wif"" is in the second position and ""red"" is the second in the output.

Input: wif lug zup -> Output: red blue yellow
""wif"" is in the first position and ""red"" is the first in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""zup"" appears to correspond to the color yellow. Each instance of ""zup"" in the input results in ""yellow"" appearing in the output at the corresponding position. The number of other words following ""zup"" does not affect its corresponding output. Thus, the rule seems to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output. To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can analyze the consistent color it translates to in each output:

1. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
2. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf -> Output: yellow red green red red
3. Input: lug zup bluf dax -> Output: blue yellow yellow green
4. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup -> Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
5. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax -> Output: blue green green red green

Looking at the respective outputs where the word ""bluf"" appears, we see the following:

1. ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""
2. ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
3. ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
4. ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
5. ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""

In trying to find a pattern, we notice that the word ""bluf"" does not consistently map to the same color in output. Hence, there is likely a context-dependent rule here.

The rule appears to involve the position of ""bluf"" relative to the other words:

1. In the first input, ""bluf"" is the second word and corresponds to ""blue"" in the second place.
2. In the second input, ""bluf"" is the last word and corresponds to the last color ""red.""
3. In the third input, ""bluf"" is the third word and corresponds to the third color ""yellow.""
4. In the fourth input, ""bluf"" is the second word and corresponds to the second color ""red.""
5. In the fifth input, ""bluf"" is the third word and corresponds to the third color ""green.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it corresponds to the color that matches its position in the input. For example, if ""bluf"" is the second word, it outputs the color that is the rule for the second position.

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" is the color that corresponds to its position in the sequence. If ""bluf"" is the nth word in the input, it outputs the color associated with the nth position.
To decipher the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the given examples:

1. Input: ""zup wif walm"" -> Output: ""yellow red red red""
2. Input: ""zup wif walm lug"" -> Output: ""yellow red red red blue""
3. Input: ""dax lug walm"" -> Output: ""green blue blue blue""
4. Input: ""wif walm zup"" -> Output: ""red red red yellow""
5. Input: ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""

Looking at the inputs and corresponding outputs:

- The presence of ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color before it.
- In example 1, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red,"" hence the triple ""red.""
- In example 2, ""walm"" still follows ""wif,"" and the output is still three ""reds"" in a row.
- In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" corresponding to ""blue,"" leading to a triple ""blue.""
- In example 4, although ""walm"" precedes ""zup,"" the output has ""red"" repeated before the ""zup"" color ""yellow.""
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows a second ""zup,"" so there are three ""yellows"" total, two for the ""zups,"" and one additional for ""walm.""

The rule for ""walm"" seems to be: Repeat the color of the word that comes before ""walm"" three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif walm
    ",Output: blue red red red,blue red red red,True,13
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, irrespective of its position in the input sequence. ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
In the context of the provided examples, ""dax"" appears to convey the meaning ""green."" Additionally, it seems that each preceding word translates into a specific color, and the output sequence of colors is directly related to the input sequence of words.

To form a rule, let's analyze the examples:

1. ""wif dax"" -> ""red green""
- Here, ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

2. ""lug dax"" -> ""blue green""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" remains ""green.""

3. ""wif bluf dax"" -> ""red red green""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""bluf"" also translates to ""red,"" and ""dax"" still means ""green.""

4. ""dax lug"" -> ""green blue""
- ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

5. ""dax zup walm wif walm"" -> ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red""
- The word ""dax"" results in ""green,"" ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" seems to duplicate the color of the word it follows, and ""wif"" is ""red.""

From this analysis, it is clear that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
From the provided input-output examples, we can analyze the position of the nonce word ""zup"" and the corresponding output in the same position to deduce its meaning.

1. Input: zup wif zup
   Output: yellow red yellow
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" both times it appears in the input.

2. Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax
   Output: green green yellow yellow green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" once it appears in the input.

3. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue red green green red
   - The first word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.

4. Input: lug zup dax zup
   Output: blue yellow green yellow
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" the first and second time it appears.

5. Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
   Output: green green red blue yellow
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.

Based on the above analysis, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we examine each example to see what color is output whenever ""bluf"" is present:

1. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
2. dax lug bluf wif -> green blue blue red
3. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
4. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
5. lug bluf wif lug bluf zup -> blue blue red blue blue yellow

From the examples, it is clear that the color following the word ""bluf"" is always the same as the color that corresponds to the word before ""bluf"":

1. In the first example, ""zup"" outputs yellow, ""bluf"" is followed by yellow.
2. In the second example, ""lug"" outputs blue, ""bluf"" is followed by blue.
3. In the third example, ""zup"" outputs yellow, ""bluf"" is followed by yellow.
4. In the fourth example, ""dax"" outputs green, ""bluf"" is followed by green.
5. In the fifth example, ""lug"" outputs blue, ""bluf"" is followed by blue, and later again ""lug"" outputs blue, ""bluf"" is followed by blue.

It seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" takes on the value of the color corresponding to the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the correspondences in each of the contexts it appears:

1. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
2. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
3. ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue""
4. ""lug dax walm"" -> ""blue green green green""
5. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" -> ""green blue blue blue yellow red""

We can attempt to identify a pattern based on the associated output colors for each input that contains ""walm.""

Considering that the color before ""walm"" is repeated one more time after ""walm,"" and the color representing ""walm"" itself is blue, we can hypothesize the following rule:

walm -> Repeat the previous color once and then add blue.

Checking this rule with the examples:

1. ""lug walm"" has ""lug"" represented by blue, so it repeats blue once and then adds blue, resulting in ""blue blue blue.""
2. In ""dax lug walm,"" ""lug"" is blue, so it repeats blue once and then adds blue, giving us ""green blue blue blue"" (with ""dax"" represented by green).
3. For ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug,"" ""lug"" is represented by blue, hence after ""bluf,"" it repeats blue once and then adds blue, resulting in the sequence ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue"" (with ""wif"" represented by red, ""zup"" by yellow, ""bluf"" by blue, and ""dax"" by green).
4. ""lug dax walm"" has ""dax"" represented by green, so after ""lug,"" it repeats green once and then adds blue, resulting in ""blue green green green.""
5. Finally, in ""dax lug walm zup wif,"" ""lug"" is blue, so it repeats blue once and then adds blue, which provides us with ""green blue blue blue yellow red"" (with ""zup"" represented by yellow and ""wif"" by red).

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color once and then add blue.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,14
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning is ""blue"". Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it translates to ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be as follows:

Rule: dax -> green

Each example shows that whenever the nonce word ""dax"" appears, it translates to the color ""green.""
From the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

In each case, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"":

- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
- ""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red""
- ""lug wif"" -> ""blue red""
- ""dax bluf wif"" -> ""green green red""

Moreover, ""wif"" is followed by a color word in English that matches the output sequence every time it appears. This implies that ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red"" irrespective of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns and associations between the inputs and the outputs.

In the first example:
Input: wif bluf lug dax wif
Output: red red blue green red

- The word ""wif"" is associated with ""red"" both times it appears.
- The word ""lug"" is associated with ""blue.""
- The word ""dax"" is associated with ""green.""

In the second example:
Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow

- The word ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow.""
- Here ""lug"" again is associated with ""blue.""
- ""bluf"" at the end is associated with ""yellow,"" which is the same color associated with ""zup.""

In the third example:
Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red

- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" is associated with ""red.""
- ""bluf"" is associated with ""red,"" which is the color associated with the preceding word ""wif.""

In the fourth example:
Input: wif bluf lug
Output: red red blue

- ""wif"" is associated with ""red.""
- ""bluf"" is again associated with ""red,"" consistent with the preceding word ""wif.""
- ""lug"" remains associated with ""blue.""

In the fifth example:
Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
Output: yellow blue red green green red

- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" is associated with ""blue.""
- ""wif"" is associated with ""red.""
- ""dax"" is associated with ""green.""
- ""bluf"" is associated with ""green,"" which is the same color as the preceding word ""dax.""
- The final ""wif"" is again associated with ""red.""

Taking into account these observations, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> the color associated with the word immediately before it.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" affects the color output of the subsequent words up to the next occurrence of the word ""dax"" or up to the end of the input if ""dax"" does not appear again.

Here are the observations leading to the rule:

- When ""walm"" is introduced after ""wif,"" all subsequent colors repeated the same as the one immediately following ""walm"" until the input string ends or a new rule word appears. For example, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"" (Example 1), and ""zup walm wif"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow red"" (Example 5).
- When ""walm"" appears on its own or at the end of the string without a ""dax"" later in the sequence, all colors following are the same until the end of the string, such as ""lug walm"" leading to ""blue blue blue"" (Example 3).
- If ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" the color ""green"" continues until a ""lug"" or a new ""dax"" appears or until the end of the input string (Example 4: ""dax walm zup lug dax"" becomes ""green green green yellow blue green"").

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> causes the next color word to repeat its output for all following words until either ""dax"" appears again or the input sequence ends. If ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" then ""green"" repeats instead.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,15
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we will look for patterns in the examples provided. Each example includes the word ""dax"" alongside other words, each of which corresponds to a color in the output.

Observing the inputs and corresponding outputs:

1. ""dax walm wif zup"" -> ""green green green red yellow""
2. ""zup dax lug"" -> ""yellow green blue""
3. ""wif dax wif"" -> ""red green red""
4. ""wif dax"" -> ""red green""
5. ""dax wif"" -> ""green red""

In every instance where ""dax"" is used, the corresponding color in the output is ""green."" Regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence or the other words around it, it consistently results in the color ""green"" in the output. This consistent mapping suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. 

Based on this analysis, we have the rule:
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"". Each time ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding output. The position of ""wif"" in the input sequence does not seem to affect the translation, as it consistently results in ""red"" regardless of its position.

Therefore, the rule is: wif -> red.
Analyzing the examples given, below is the rule induction for the nonce word ""zup"":

1. In the first example, ""zup lug"" translates to ""yellow blue."" Here zup corresponds to yellow.
2. In the second example, ""wif zup dax"" translates to ""red yellow green."" The word zup again corresponds to yellow.
3. In the third example, ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""green red yellow yellow red red red."" In this sequence, zup corresponds to yellow.
4. In the fourth example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow."" Here, zup translates to yellow, along with walm, which also translates to yellow.
5. The fifth example ""zup lug"" is the same as the first example, providing the same translation ""yellow blue,"" reaffirming the meaning derived for zup.

Based on these examples, the rule is: zup translates to the color yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
From the given examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the output. Here is how we can reach that conclusion:

Example 1:
- lug dax bluf -> blue green green
Since lug results in blue, and dax results in green, bluf must correspond to the second green.

Example 2:
- zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup -> yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
We know dax is green, and zup is yellow. Since bluf appears between yellow and blue, and between blue and green, and we have confirmed earlier that dax is green, we can infer that bluf corresponds to the first green. This is consistent with the previous example.

Example 3:
- dax bluf wif zup lug -> green green red yellow blue
dax is green, zup is yellow, and lug is blue. With bluf following a known green and preceding a known red, it translates once more to green.

Example 4 & 5:
- In both cases, bluf follows dax (which we've established as green), and in both outputs, the word that follows green is also green. This also holds true in previous examples where bluf is followed by a color that is not green, so its translation does not seem to be dependent on the following word.

Thus, we can conclude:
bluf -> green

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we must analyze its usage in the given examples and look for patterns in relation to the output provided.

- Example 1: dax walm zup lug walm -> green green green yellow blue blue blue
  In sequence: green (dax), green (walm), green (zup), yellow (lug), blue (walm).
  The word ""walm"" directly follows ""dax"" and ""lug"" in these cases and results in ""green"" in the first instance and ""blue"" in the second.

- Example 2: wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue
  No direct antecedent can be observed as ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, producing ""blue.""

- Example 3: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green
  ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" and leads to ""blue,"" ""dax"" precedes and follows ""walm"" leading to a sequence of two different colors.

- Example 4: zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
  ""Walm"" follows ""wif"" and results in ""red.""

- Example 5: zup wif dax walm lug -> yellow red green green green blue
  ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" and leads to ""green.""

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" carries the same color as the word that precedes it:

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the color is green.
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the color is blue.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the color is red.

There is no example where ""walm"" follows ""zup"" or ""bluf,"" so we cannot confirm the output for these cases.

Rule: walm -> meaning: The word ""walm"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Therefore, the deduced rule is: walm -> takes the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Rule: 'lug' translates to the color blue.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the provided examples, whenever the word 'dax' appears in the input, the word 'green' appears in the corresponding output, regardless of the position of 'dax' within the input sequence or the other words around it. Hence, 'dax' corresponds to the color 'green'.
Rule: wif -> red

The examples show that each time the word ""wif"" is mentioned, the output is ""red"". Regardless of the context or position in the sequence, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"".
Rule: zup -> yellow

Each occurrence of ""zup"" in the input is translated to ""yellow"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns in the examples given. Each input line contains the word ""bluf"" and is translated into colors in the output. We'll examine the color that follows ""bluf"" in each output.

1. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
2. zup bluf lug zup -> yellow yellow blue yellow
3. dax bluf lug wif -> green green blue red
4. zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue
5. lug bluf zup lug -> blue blue yellow blue

In examples 1, 2, and 3, the color that follows ""bluf"" matches the color assigned to the word immediately following ""bluf"" in the input. In example 4, the word ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the matching output colors are yellow and blue, among which blue follows ""bluf."" Example 5 also confirms that ""bluf"" is followed by blue when the next word is ""zup.""

It seems like ""bluf"" could mean ""repeat the next color,"" but we notice that ""bluf"" itself is associated with a color in the output as well, which is consistent whenever ""bluf"" appears:

- In the first position after ""bluf"" in the output: red, yellow, green, yellow, blue
- The corresponding color of ""bluf"" in the preceding word: dax (green), zup (yellow), dax (green), zup (yellow), lug (blue)

In these examples, the color preceding ""bluf"" is the same as the color that represents ""bluf"" itself. Therefore, the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it and commands the next word to repeat its color in the output.

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color of the preceding word and the following word's color in the output.
By analyzing the input-output patterns, it seems that the appearance of ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it. More specifically, after a ""walm"" is introduced, the color of the preceding word is repeated three times.

Let's verify this with the given examples:

1. In ""dax lug dax lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so after ""walm,"" you see ""blue blue blue.""
2. In ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so after ""walm,"" you see ""yellow yellow yellow.""
3. In ""dax zup dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so after ""walm,"" you see ""green green green.""
4. In ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green,"" so after ""walm,"" you see ""green green green.""
5. In ""dax walm zup lug,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so after ""walm,"" you see ""green green green."" Then the pattern resumes normally with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Based on the above observations, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the word immediately before it to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf
    ",Output: yellow yellow,yellow yellow,True,17
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can infer that ""lug"" consistently maps to the color ""blue."" Regardless of the position of ""lug"" within the sequence, it translates to ""blue."" The other words appear to correspond to other colors, with ""wif"" mapping to ""red,"" ""zup"" mapping to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" mapping to ""green.""

Therefore, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, one can infer the following:

Example 1: 
- Input: zup dax wif zup
- Output: yellow green red yellow
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Example 2:
- Input: dax zup wif
- Output: green yellow red
- This further reinforces the idea that ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""dax"" is ""green"", and ""wif"" is ""red"".

Example 3:
- Input: dax
- Output: green
- ""dax"" by itself results in ""green"", which supports the previous inferences.

Example 4:
- Input: dax wif zup dax
- Output: green red yellow green
- This continues to match the pattern where ""dax"" is ""green"", ""wif"" is ""red"", and ""zup"" is ""yellow"".

Example 5:
- Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
- Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
- Here, we see that ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" to ""blue"".

Rule: dax -> green

Hence, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".
Based on the examples provided:

- When ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red"".
- The word ""wif"" does not influence the color associated with other words; ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"".

Hence, we can deduce that the word ""wif"" maps to the color ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow"" regardless of the context it is used in. Therefore, we can deduce that:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".
Reviewing the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, a pattern emerges that allows us to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"".

In each case, the output for ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Moreover, it appears that ""bluf"" not only translates to ""red"" but also repeats the color that directly precedes it.

Let's verify this by looking at each example:

1. Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue yellow red red green
   The word before ""bluf"" is ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"", and ""bluf"" is also ""red"".

2. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
   Output: red yellow yellow red green
   The word before ""bluf"" is ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"", and both ""zup"" and ""bluf"" translate to ""yellow"".

3. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow green yellow green red red
   The word before ""bluf"" is ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"", and ""bluf"" is also ""red"".

4. Input: dax lug wif bluf
   Output: green blue red red
   The word before ""bluf"" is ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"", and ""bluf"" is also ""red"".

5. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow
   The word before ""bluf"" is ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"", and ""bluf"" is also ""red"".

Taking all of the above into account, the rule that can be induced is:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: ""bluf"" translates to ""red"", while also doubling the color that comes immediately before it in the sequence. Rule: ""bluf"" yields the output ""red"" followed by the repetition of the preceding color's output.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let us examine its occurrence in the given examples:

1. zup lug walm wif dax -> yellow blue blue blue red green
2. dax walm zup -> green green green yellow
3. zup wif dax walm lug -> yellow red green green green blue
4. lug wif walm -> blue red red red
5. dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue blue yellow red

Here are the observations:

- In examples 1, 3, and 5, the output color sequence contains one additional ""green"" after ""walm"" is introduced.
- In example 2, ""walm"" is before ""zup"" and the output for both is ""green"".
- In example 4, ""walm"" leads to three ""red"" in the output.

From these observations, we can derive the following rule:

Whenever ""walm"" appears, the color it corresponds to repeats the color of the word directly preceding it.

This can be verified since, in every example, the color following ""walm"" is the same as the color corresponding to the word before it.

Rule: walm -> the color of the preceding word repeated.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup dax lug
    ",Output: red yellow green blue,red yellow green blue,True,18
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the output. Each time ""lug"" is presented in the input, ""blue"" is the corresponding word in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, it seems that each word corresponds to a color. The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position within the series of words. Therefore:

dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"".
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the Output. Each time ""wif"" appears in the Input, ""red"" is the corresponding term in the Output. No other context seems to be given that changes the meaning of ""wif.""

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow. 

Each occurrence of the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze each pair of input-output examples:

1. dax wif dax zup bluf -> green red green yellow yellow
Here, ""dax"" is mapped to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" Since ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and yields another ""yellow,"" this could suggest that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word preceding it, but more evidence is needed.

2. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue
In this example, ""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" again maps to ""red."" Following this pattern, ""bluf"" is used after ""lug"" and results in another ""blue."" This further supports the idea that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word right before it.

3. wif bluf lug -> red red blue
In this case, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" and ""lug"" comes after and is ""blue."" Again, the color for ""bluf"" matches the color of the word preceding it, which is ""red.""

4. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
""Zup"" is mapped to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and the color of ""bluf"" is ""red"" again, matching the color of ""wif"" that appears just before it.

5. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
""Zup"" is ""yellow,"" and so is ""bluf,"" which could suggest that ""bluf"" is indeed ""yellow"" in this case. However, this is consistent with the previous examples if we consider ""bluf"" to be taking the color of the preceding word.

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence.

Therefore:

bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word.
walm -> meaning. Rule:

Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to result in a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it. The number of repetitions corresponds to the number of syllables in the preceding word. 

Let's examine the examples:

1. ""dax lug walm""
   Output: ""green blue blue blue""
   - ""dax"" results in ""green""
   - ""lug"" results in ""blue""
   - ""walm"" following ""lug"" leads to ""blue"" being repeated three times (assuming ""lug"" has one syllable).

2. ""dax walm""
   Output: ""green green green""
   - ""dax"" results in ""green""
   - ""walm"" following ""dax"" leads to ""green"" being repeated three times.

3. ""zup walm""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
   - ""zup"" results in ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" following ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"" being repeated three times.

4. ""zup dax walm""
   Output: ""yellow green green green""
   - ""zup"" results in ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" results in ""green""
   - ""walm"" following ""dax"" leads to ""green"" being repeated three times.

5. ""zup walm""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
   - ""zup"" results in ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" following ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"" being repeated three times.

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to be repeated a number of times equal to the number of syllables in the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue.""
Rule: dax -> green

Each instance of the word 'dax' in the input corresponds to the color 'green' in the output, regardless of its position or the other words around it.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" To confirm, we should ensure that each instance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.

Let's examine each example:

1. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red""
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue""

2. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red""
   - ""bluf"" translates to ""red""
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""

3. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red""
   - ""walm"" translates to ""red""
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green""
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""

4. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red""

5. Input: wif lug zup bluf
   Output: red blue yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red""
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" (note the difference from the second example)

From these points, we can discern that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. However, there is an inconsistency with the word ""bluf,"" as it translates to ""red"" in the second example but to ""yellow"" in the fifth example. This inconsistency is not directly related to our task of defining ""wif,"" but it's an anomaly worth mentioning.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of the context in which it appears.
Based on the input and output examples provided, we can induce the following pattern for the word ""bluf"":

- Whenever ""bluf"" is present in the input, the word immediately preceding it translates to green (as seen with ""dax wif bluf"" -> ""green red red"", ""wif zup dax bluf"" -> ""red yellow green green"", and ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" -> ""blue red blue green green"").

- ""bluf"" on its own translates to yellow (as seen in ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"").

- ""bluf"" does not seem to have a standalone meaning but affects the word preceding it, turning the output of that word to green.

Hence, the rule for ""bluf"" is that it changes the color associated with the word immediately before it to green if there is a word before it, or to yellow if it is the first or only word.

Rule: bluf -> if there is a preceding word, change the preceding word's output to green; if ""bluf"" is the first or only word, the output is yellow.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" refers to a repetition of the color represented by the word immediately preceding it. To confirm this observation, we can analyze each input and its corresponding output:

- In the first example, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" indicating that ""walm"" means repeat the ""red"" thrice.
- In the second example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" implying that ""walm"" means repeat the ""blue"" thrice.
- In the third and fourth examples, ""lug walm"" again leads to ""blue blue blue,"" further supporting the repetition rule, and ""dax"" then adds ""green"" after the repetition.
- In the fifth example, ""zup walm wif walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow red red red,"" which aligns with repeating the colors represented by ""zup"" (yellow) and ""wif"" (red) thrice each.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color denoted by the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug bluf wif
    ",Output: green blue green red,green blue blue red,False,20
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the listed examples, the word ""lug"" consistently maps to the color blue. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in all provided examples.
To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we look for patterns in the corresponding outputs:

- ""wif bluf zup"" corresponds to ""red red yellow""
- ""lug wif dax zup walm"" corresponds to ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow""
- ""zup wif"" corresponds to ""yellow red""
- ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""
- ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red""

First, consider what happens to the words around ""wif"":

- In the first example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" and both translate to ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" follows ""dax"" and is followed by ""bluf,"" both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""bluf,"" both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""red.""

These examples suggest that ""wif"" does something to the word that follows it, turning it into ""red.""

There's an exception to consider in the second example: ""wif dax zup walm"" becomes ""red green yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""wif"" is followed by ""dax,"" which turns into ""green"" rather than ""red."" This suggests that the rule for ""wif"" might not apply when another color (like ""green"" in this case) follows.

One possible interpretation of ""wif"" could then be that it makes the following word replicate the color before it, except when the original color of the following word is ""green."" This could explain why ""dax"" remains ""green"" following ""wif,"" as green might be an exception to the replication.

However, upon closer inspection, we notice that the assumption that ""wif"" makes the following word replicate the color before it doesn't hold up. There is no previous color before ""wif"" in ""zup wif,"" but ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red."" Therefore, we must refine our rule.

When ""wif"" is present, it consistently corresponds to ""red,"" as seen in all examples.

In conclusion, ""wif"" itself means red. The presence of ""wif"" has no direct discernible impact on the adjacent words to alter their corresponding colors, except that when ""bluf"" appears next to ""wif,"" ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red,"" which might be a special rule for the pair ""wif bluf.""

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in each given example.
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""bluf"" is translated as ""red"" when it comes after the term ""wif."" When ""bluf"" appears sandwiched between two identical words, it is also translated as ""red."" Here are the observations:

1. In the first example, ""wif bluf"" maps to ""red red.""
2. In the second example, ""dax bluf wif"" maps to ""green green red."" This could suggest that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that follows it.
3. In the third example, ""wif bluf"" maps to ""blue red red,"" which again shows ""bluf"" mapping to ""red"" after ""wif.""
4. In the fourth example, ""wif bluf"" maps to ""red red,"" which is consistent with the previous instances of ""wif bluf.""
5. In the fifth example, ""wif bluf"" is simply ""red red.""

However, there is an inconsistency in the third input: ""lug walm wif bluf"" outputs ""blue blue blue red red,"" but according to the pattern observed before, ""wif bluf"" should translate to ""blue red."" Since it translates to ""blue red red,"" we can deduce that the context of the word before ""bluf"" plays a role, as ""walm"" does not appear in any other example, and its output is ""blue,"" which is different from ""lug"" and ""wif"" which result in a repeated color output.

Given this, and because the examples are limited, a definitive rule for ""bluf"" cannot be established with certainty, but according to the data provided, ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" when it appears after the word ""wif.""

Rule: bluf -> ""red"" when it comes after ""wif"" or between two identical words.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" has an effect on the colors that follow it. After the appearance of ""walm,"" the color associated with the immediate preceding word is repeated for the remaining positions. Here is how the rule applies to each example:

1. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" translates to ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue."" ""Walm"" is followed by ""yellow,"" which is the color associated with ""zup."" After ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated.

2. ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red."" The color ""red"" associated with ""wif"" is repeated throughout after ""walm.""

3. ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red."" Similar to the previous cases, ""red"" associated with ""wif"" is repeated after ""walm.""

4. ""wif lug walm"" translates to ""red blue blue blue."" The color ""blue"" associated with ""lug"" is repeated after ""walm.""

5. ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" After ""walm,"" ""blue"" associated with ""lug"" is repeated.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the immediate preceding word for the remaining positions in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" appears to be consistently translated as ""blue"" in each of the given examples, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the following patterns arise:

- ""zup"" always produces the output ""yellow""
- ""lug"" always produces the output ""blue""
- ""walm"" always produces the output ""blue""
- ""wif"" always produces the output ""red""

Every occurrence of ""dax"" corresponds with an output of ""green"", regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words. Therefore, the word ""dax"" alone correlates with ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's analyze the input-output pairs:

- When ""lug walm wif bluf"" is input, the output is ""blue blue blue red red."" The word ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" which corresponds to two reds at the end of the sequence, suggesting that ""wif"" may correspond to red since it also precedes ""bluf.""

- When ""wif lug"" is input, the output is ""red blue."" This supports the previous deduction that ""wif"" maps to red, as ""lug"" follows and maps to blue.

- In ""wif walm dax zup,"" the output is ""red red red green yellow,"" where each word translates to a color and ""wif"" again corresponds to red.

- With ""wif zup"" input resulting in ""red yellow,"" we again see ""wif"" translating to red.

- The final example ""wif lug"" and its output ""red blue"" further reinforces the previous observations.

Considering these examples, it appears the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red.
Rule: zup -> yellow

In every instance provided, regardless of what other words were present, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"". Hence, ""zup"" likely means ""yellow"".
From the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" might correspond to the repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately after ""bluf"". Here's the analysis:

1. In ""dax bluf wif"", ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""wif"" corresponds to red. The output is ""green green red,"" meaning that ""bluf"" takes the color of ""wif"" and repeats it (in this case, red).

2. In ""wif lug bluf wif zup"", ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""lug"" to blue, and ""zup"" to yellow. The output, ""red blue blue red yellow"", shows that ""bluf"" corresponds to the repetition of the color of the word following it (twice red after ""bluf"" and then once for the actual ""wif"").

3. In ""lug zup bluf dax"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""dax"" to green. The output is ""blue yellow yellow green,"" so ""bluf"" corresponds to the color green being repeated twice for ""dax"".

4. In ""wif bluf dax"", ""wif"" corresponds to red and ""dax"" to green. The output is ""red red green,"" which again shows ""bluf"" causes the repetition of ""dax""'s green color.

5. In ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"", each word corresponds to a color, and the output is ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" The word ""bluf"" here repeats the red color associated with ""wif"" that comes after it.

Based on the patterns observed, the rule for the word ""bluf"" seems to be that it causes the color corresponding to the word immediately following it to be repeated once in the output.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the following word.
Observing the sequences provided and the respective outputs, we can try to figure out the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" by looking at the patterns before and after it:

1. lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue
2. zup walm lug zup wif dax -> yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
3. dax walm zup -> green green green yellow 
4. zup walm dax -> yellow yellow yellow green 
5. zup lug walm wif walm -> yellow blue blue blue red red red

Based on these examples:

- Every time ""walm"" appears, the color after ""walm"" repeats for a certain amount of times before switching to a different color.
- The color that repeats is the same color that would be the output for the word right after ""walm"". For instance, in example 1, ""lug"" after ""walm"" gets outputted as ""blue"", and there are three ""yellow"" outputs before reaching ""lug"".

This leads us to deduce that ""walm"" causes the color of the word that follows it to repeat a number of times. To determine the exact times it repeats, we count the repetitions in the given examples:

1. ""walm lug"" resulted in ""yellow yellow yellow"". Hence ""walm"" resulted in three repetitions.
2. ""walm lug"" resulted in ""yellow yellow yellow"". Again, ""walm"" resulted in three repetitions.
3. ""walm zup"" resulted in ""green green green"". Three repetitions here as well.
4. ""walm dax"" resulted in ""yellow yellow yellow"". Also, three repetitions.
5. ""walm wif walm"" resulted in ""blue blue blue red red red"". The first ""walm"" resulted in three repetitions of ""blue"", and the second ""walm"" resulted in three repetitions of ""red"".

So the rule is: 

Rule: walm -> Forces the next color to be repeated three times.

Hence, the next element's color translates to the output color and is outputted three times before moving to the next word/color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color blue in the output, regardless of context within the examples provided.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""dax"" correlates to the color ""green."" Each instance of ""dax"" in the input is translated to ""green"" in the output. No other contextual dependency seems to affect this translation. Thus, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Each occurrence of ""wif"" in an input results in ""red"" being included in the output for that instance.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that different words correspond to different colors in the Output. The word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" across all examples. Here is the analysis:

- In Example 1, ""zup"" is followed by ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""bluf,"" which translate to ""yellow red green red red."" This suggests that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In Example 2, ""zup lug"" translates to ""yellow blue,"" confirming that ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""lug"" is ""blue.""
- In Example 3, ""zup wif lug"" gives ""yellow red blue,"" again suggesting ""zup"" is ""yellow.""
- In Example 4, ""dax zup dax zup"" translates to ""green yellow green yellow,"" indicating that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In Example 5, ""wif walm zup"" converts to ""red red red yellow,"" further supporting that ""zup"" equates to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the provided examples, each instance of the nonce word ""bluf"" is followed by a color corresponding to the word that comes after ""bluf"". However, in every case, the color specified by ""bluf"" is the same as the color for the word that precedes ""bluf"". It seems that ""bluf"" causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated. Here's the pattern according to the examples:

1. ""dax bluf wif"" translates to ""green green red""; ""green"" for ""dax"" is repeated due to ""bluf"".
2. ""wif bluf dax lug"" translates to ""red red green blue""; ""red"" for ""wif"" is repeated.
3. ""lug bluf wif lug bluf zup"" translates to ""blue blue red blue blue yellow""; ""blue"" for ""lug"" is repeated twice due to two instances of ""bluf"".
4. ""wif bluf zup"" translates to ""red red yellow""; ""red"" for ""wif"" is repeated.
5. ""dax walm wif bluf"" translates to ""green green green red red""; ""green"" for both ""dax"" and ""wif"" is repeated after ""bluf"".

Rule: bluf -> causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should consider its placement in different inputs and the corresponding outputs.

1. In input ""dax lug walm,"" where dax -> green and lug -> blue, the output is ""green blue blue blue."" This suggests that ""walm"" is operating to repeat the color mentioned right before it in the sequence.

2. In input ""wif walm zup,"" where wif -> red and zup -> yellow, the output is ""red red red yellow."" Again, ""walm"" seems to cause the repetition of the color before it, repeating red three times.

3. In input ""zup walm wif,"" with zup -> yellow and wif -> red, the output is ""yellow yellow yellow red."" ""Walm"" again causes the preceding color, yellow, to repeat three times.

4. In input ""lug dax walm wif,"" the output is ""blue green green green red."" The word ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which might explain the three greens. However, ""lug"" here is represented only once as blue, which is unlike the pattern seen previously where ""walm"" caused repetition of the preceding color. This discrepancy might be because the color produced by ""walm"" (green in this case) is sustained until the next color word ""wif"" (red) appears.

5. In input ""wif walm lug bluf,"" the output is ""red red red blue blue."" Here, ""walm"" repeats red, and ""lug"" is followed by ""bluf,"" both of which turn blue twice.

From these examples, we infer that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it three times, and this pattern persists until a new color word is encountered. If the new color word also has a repeat modifier (like ""bluf"" might), then the new color repeats for the number of times the modifier specifies.

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the color word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times in the output sequence, continuing this color until a new color word is encountered.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green

    Input: wif lug wif
    ",Output: red blue red,red blue red,True,23
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each word corresponds to a specific color:

- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- walm -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red

Rule: lug -> blue.
From analyzing the input-output pairs provided, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the output, irrespective of its position in the input string or the surrounding words.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" means ""green"".
To deduce the meaning of ""wif"" based on the examples provided, let's analyze the patterns and attempt to draw correlations between the input and output. Our focus will be on any consistent output that coincides with the presence of the word ""wif"" in the input:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

2. Input: lug dax zup lug wif
   Output: blue green yellow blue red

3. Input: wif zup dax
   Output: red yellow green

4. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red

5. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue red red red

Observations:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears, the corresponding output is ""red"".
- ""wif"" does not seem to depend on position within the input sequence, as it appears in different positions and still corresponds to ""red"".
- The output ""red"" is only associated with ""wif"" and does not occur with other nonce words in the provided examples.

Based on this analysis, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position or context within the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow. Rule: In every instance, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that the word ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it. Here's the breakdown:

- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red""
- ""dax bluf wif zup"" results in ""green green red yellow""
- ""wif bluf lug"" results in ""red red blue""
- ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow""
- ""wif bluf"" (repeated for consistency check) results in ""red red""

So, the rule appears to be as follows:

Rule: Bluf -> causes the output to repeat the color associated with the previous word.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" operates as a color modifier that repeats the next color word a certain number of times, specifically three times. 

For instance, in the first example, ""dax walm zup walm,"" the output is ""green green green yellow yellow yellow."" The ""walm"" after ""dax"" (which must mean ""green"" given this result) causes ""green"" to be repeated three times. The ""walm"" after ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"" being repeated three times.

Similarly, in the second example, ""lug walm dax,"" ""lug"" translating to ""blue"" is repeated three times due to ""walm"" and is followed by one ""green"" for ""dax.""

Let's summarize these observations systematically:

- ""dax walm zup walm"" -> ""green green green yellow yellow yellow""
- ""lug walm dax"" -> ""blue blue blue green""
- ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red blue blue""
- ""lug wif dax walm zup"" -> ""blue red green green green yellow""
- ""zup wif walm lug"" -> ""yellow red red red blue""

Walm -> Repeats the next color word three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" is used after a color word, that color word is outputted three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,24
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each given example.
Based on the examples provided where ""dax"" directly translates to an output without dependence on surrounding words, we can induce the following rule:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to ""red"". Each additional word after 'wif' has its own corresponding color, with ""zup"" translating to ""yellow"", ""bluf"" to ""red"", and ""walm"" to ""yellow yellow"". ""lug"" seems to translate to ""blue"".
Based on the examples provided, I will induce a rule for the nonce word ""zup"". 

1. When ""lug"" follows ""zup"", the output is ""yellow blue"". 
2. When ""wif"" is inserted between ""zup"" and ""lug"", an extra color ""red"" is added between ""yellow"" and ""blue"".
3. When ""zup"" follows ""lug"", the order of colors is reversed, producing ""blue yellow"".
4. When ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""yellow yellow"", which suggests that ""bluf"" might be translated directly to ""yellow"".
5. Finally, when ""zup"" is followed by ""dax walm"", we get ""yellow green green green""; it seems that ""dax"" might translate to a single ""green"" and ""walm"" to ""green green"", or that ""walm"" repeats the color that precedes it.

From these examples, we can infer that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"". In each output, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and the other words after ""zup"" correspond to their translated colors in sequence. The rule seems to be initial insertion, where ""zup"" adds the color ""yellow"" to the beginning of the sequence of colors that would otherwise be translated from the input.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" means to repeat the color associated with the preceding word. 

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning: Repeat the preceding color

For example:
- In ""zup wif bluf"", ""wif"" is associated with red, and ""bluf"" repeats it, so the output is ""yellow red red"".
- In ""zup bluf"", ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and ""bluf"" repeats it, so the output is ""yellow yellow"".
- In ""lug bluf dax lug"", ""lug"" is associated with blue, ""bluf"" repeats blue, and then a new color sequence starts with ""dax"" (green).
- In ""dax bluf wif lug"", ""dax"" is associated with green, ""bluf"" repeats green, followed by ""wif"" (red), and ""lug"" (blue).
- In ""dax bluf wif lug zup"", the sequence follows as above, with the addition of ""zup"" (yellow) at the end.
Considering the given examples where ""walm"" appears and the corresponding outputs, we can infer a pattern. Here is what is evident from each instance:

1. After ""dax lug dax lug walm,"" the output is ""green blue green blue blue blue."" ""Walm"" here appears to lead to a doubling of the color that would normally follow ""lug,"" which is blue.

2. After ""zup wif dax walm lug,"" the output is ""yellow red green green green blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" doubles the following color of ""dax,"" which is green, and ""lug"" then adds its normal output, which is blue.

3. In ""dax zup dax walm,"" the output is ""green yellow green green green."" Again, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and doubles the green.

4. ""Zup dax walm zup wif"" leads to the output of ""yellow green green green yellow red,"" where ""walm"" again doubles the green that follows ""dax.""

5. Lastly, ""dax walm zup walm"" produces ""green green green yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""walm"" doubles the green output of ""dax"" and then the yellow output of ""zup.""

From these examples, the rule seems clear:

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning. Following a word (either ""dax"" or ""zup""), ""walm"" causes the corresponding color (green for ""dax"" and yellow for ""zup"") to be repeated twice in the output sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax lug dax
    ",Output: yellow green blue green,yellow green blue green,True,25
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rules for the meaning of ""lug"":

- In the first example, ""lug"" is followed by ""zup"" and the corresponding output colors change from red to blue. This suggests that ""lug"" initiates a change in the output color pattern.
  
- In the second example, ""lug"" is again followed by a different word (""dax"") and the output color changes from green to blue.

- In the third example, ""lug"" is followed by ""zup"" and again the color changes to blue after ""lug"".

- In the fourth and fifth examples, whenever ""lug"" appears, it corresponds to the color blue.

Combining these observations, it seems that ""lug"" corresponds directly to the color blue. 

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""dax."" Here is the analysis of the examples:

1. ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" -> ""blue red green green red blue""
- It seems that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""
- Following this pattern, ""dax"" in the middle appears to translate to a sequence of ""green,"" and the pattern then repeats in reverse.

2. ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" -> ""red green red red yellow red""
- ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" follows ""wif,"" matching ""green.""
- ""bluf"" remains consistent with ""red,"" and ""zup"" is the only element paired with ""yellow.""

3. ""lug wif dax"" -> ""blue red green""
- Interestingly, ""dax"" appears after ""wif,"" resulting in ""green.""

4. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""
- Both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" translate to ""red,"" while ""dax"" is followed by ""green,"" which is also followed by another ""green"" associated with ""walm.""

5. ""wif dax"" -> ""red green""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

Rule:
Based on the above examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" translates directly to ""green."" There is consistency in the translation, regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the sequence. Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""dax"" represents the color ""green,"" fitting neatly within the examples provided without additional context-dependent variations.

dax -> green.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif"" from the given examples, let's look for patterns in the inputs and their corresponding colors in the outputs.

From the first example:
- Input: ""wif bluf dax walm""
- Output: ""red red green green green""
The word ""wif"" correlates with ""red.""

From the second example:
- Input: ""zup lug zup wif dax""
- Output: ""yellow blue yellow red green""
Again, the word ""wif"" correlates with ""red.""

From the third example:
- Input: ""wif""
- Output: ""red""
The word ""wif"" alone correlates with ""red.""

From the fourth example:
- Input: ""zup bluf wif dax lug""
- Output: ""yellow yellow red green blue""
Again, ""wif"" correlates with ""red.""

From the fifth example:
- Input: ""lug bluf wif""
- Output: ""blue blue red""
And once more, ""wif"" correlates with ""red.""

Based on the examples provided, every instance where ""wif"" is present in the input, the corresponding output color is ""red."" Therefore, we can conclude:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in every example provided.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to identify patterns and consistencies between the examples given. Let's look at each example and see what we can deduce:

1. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green

2. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green

3. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
   Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow

4. Input: zup bluf dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow green blue

5. Input: zup bluf wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow red red

From these examples, we can see that every time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" is part of the sequence in the corresponding output. However, it's important to note that ""yellow"" also appears in the output for other words, such as ""zup.""

Let's find the specific part of the sequence that corresponds to ""bluf"":

1. ""bluf"" follows ""zup dax,"" and the sequence is ""yellow green green."" The second ""green"" must correspond to ""bluf"" since ""dax"" is consistent throughout the examples as ""green.""

2. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" we again get ""green green."" This reinforces that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""

3. ""bluf"" appears two times in this sequence, following ""zup"" and later followed by ""wif."" The corresponding sequence is ""yellow yellow red green red yellow."" Since ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""wif"" is ""red,"" this supports that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green""—both times it is followed by ""yellow"" in the sequence.

4. In this sequence, ""bluf"" is directly followed by ""dax,"" and we get ""yellow yellow green blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" here since ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""lug"" is likely ""blue.""

5. ""bluf"" appears twice, directly following ""zup"" each time, and both instances result in ""yellow yellow red red."" In this case, ""bluf"" seems to be ""yellow"" just like ""zup.""

The patterns are not entirely consistent when accounting for all examples, but the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" corresponds to either ""green"" or ""yellow."" In instances where it's not clear whether ""zup"" or ""bluf"" is leading to ""yellow,"" we can assume ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" thus making ""bluf"" likely ""green"" by process of elimination.

However, Example 4 complicates this by having ""bluf"" be followed by what we've determined as ""yellow,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" might also have a dependency on the position or the words around it.

With the given examples, the best rule we can determine is that ""bluf"" almost always corresponds to ""green,"" except when it directly follows ""zup,"" in which case, it might be that both are ""yellow"" due to a position-based rule or another factor not clearly outlined in the given data.

Rule: bluf -> ""green"" (with a possible exception following ""zup"" where the output is ambiguous, but it might still be ""green"").
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the appearance of the word ""walm"" corresponds to multiple repeating words in the output. Here's the analysis based on each input and output:

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""walm"" seems to cause the word ""green"" to be repeated three times.

2. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and since ""walm"" follows it, ""blue"" is repeated three times. ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

3. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""walm"" follows it, causing ""red"" to be repeated three times. ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

4. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and then ""wif"" translates to ""red."" Another ""lug"" appears, followed by ""walm,"" causing ""blue"" to be repeated three times. ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" causing ""yellow"" to repeat three times, and the last ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

5. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""walm"" follows it, causing ""red"" to be repeated three times.

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the color word that directly precedes ""walm"" two additional times, for a total of three occurrences of that color word in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: lug translates to the color ""blue"".
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

- When ""dax"" is preceded by ""lug"" (lug dax), the output is ""blue green.""
- When ""dax"" is preceded by ""zup lug"" (zup lug dax), the output is ""yellow blue green,"" where ""yellow"" is the output for ""zup,"" and the rest follows the ""lug dax"" pattern.
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm wif"" (dax walm wif), the output is ""green green green red,"" indicating that ""walm"" might mean ""green"" and ""wif"" might mean ""red"" and ""dax"" at the beginning is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is sandwiched between ""wif"" and ""lug"" (wif dax lug), the output is ""red green blue,"" which maintains the pattern where ""dax"" outputs ""green.""

In all instances, the presence of ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green,"" regardless of position (beginning, middle, or end).

Rule: dax -> ""green""
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red.""

Input: dax wif
Output: green red
- Here ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" followed by ""wif,"" which results in ""red.""

Input: wif
Output: red
- The input consists solely of the word ""wif,"" and the output is solely ""red,"" strongly suggesting ""wif"" means ""red.""

Input: zup wif lug dax
Output: yellow red blue green
- Here ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" followed by our word of interest ""wif,"" which yields ""red,"" then ""lug"" for ""blue,"" and finally ""dax"" for ""green.""

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" also translates to ""yellow,"" then ""wif"" to ""red,"" and finally, ""walm"" does not have a direct color corresponding to it, but based on the output, it seems to repeat the previous color, which in this case is ""red,"" multiple times.

Input: zup wif zup
Output: yellow red yellow
- Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" Since ""zup"" is repeated before and after ""wif,"" the sequence of colors is also symmetrical around the ""red"" color produced by ""wif.""

The rule seems quite clear: wif -> red. 

Rule:
wif means red.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. This is evident as each time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> ""repeat the color associated with the previous word""

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" follows another nonce word, the output repeats the color associated with that preceding nonce word. For instance, when ""wif"" (red) is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red."" Similarly, ""dax"" (green) followed by ""bluf"" gives ""green green,"" and ""zup"" (yellow) followed by ""bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow.""
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns and correspondences in the provided examples:

1. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
2. ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue""
3. ""lug walm zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow red""
4. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
5. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""

From the examples, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word just before it. Whenever ""walm"" is used, the output color is repeated based on the previous word's associated color. For example:

- In Example 1 and 5 the word ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the color ""green"" is repeated three times.
- In Example 2 and 4 the sequences include ""lug walm"", which corresponds to ""blue"" being repeated.
- In Example 3, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and ""blue"" is repeated thrice, following the established pattern.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup
    ",Output: blue yellow,blue yellow,True,27
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples:

- Whenever ""lug"" appears alone as an input, ""blue"" is the output.
- Whenever ""lug"" appears in combination with other nonce words, ""blue"" is added to the sequence of output colors that correspond to those other nonce words.

From these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: lug -> blue

This indicates that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"", regardless of its position in the sequence.
dax -> green

Rule: In every example where ""dax"" appears, the corresponding output is always the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words.
Based on the given examples, it appears that each non-nonce word correlates to a specific color:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> red

In every example, regardless of the surrounding words, the output for ""wif"" is consistently ""red"". It seems that ""wif"" does not depend on context or the position in the sequence; it always translates to the same color.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that:

- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""

Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position of the output. This occurs regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the sequence or the surrounding words. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze each given pairing of input and output.

1. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
2. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
3. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
4. lug bluf dax lug -> blue blue green blue
5. zup wif bluf zup -> yellow red red yellow

In the instances where ""bluf"" appears, we see the following patterns:

- ""zup bluf"" always corresponds to ""yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""bluf"" could potentially mean ""yellow,"" and ""zup"" also means ""yellow.""
- In the context of ""lug,"" ""bluf"" again mirrors the color of the word it follows or is followed by (""lug"" -> blue), suggesting ""bluf"" takes on the color of the adjacent word.
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" we get ""red red"" as the output. This consistency further supports the idea that ""bluf"" adopts the color of the nearest word.

Given these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it takes on the color of the nearest word. The pattern holds true regardless of whether ""bluf"" precedes or follows another color word.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the nearest word.
Observing the examples provided, let's try to deduce the meaning or rule behind the word ""walm"":

1. In the first example, ""dax walm wif bluf"" translates to ""green green green red red."" We notice that ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and yields two additional ""green"" in the output, while ""wif"" and ""bluf"" that follow ""walm"" result in ""red red"".

2. In the second example, ""zup wif walm"" becomes ""yellow red red red."" Here, ""zup"" on its own leads to ""yellow,"" while ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and leads to three ""red.""

3. In the third example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"", which indicates that ""walm"" following ""dax"" generates two extra ""green"" as ""dax"" on its own is associated with one ""green.""

4. In the fourth example, ""dax wif walm lug zup"" translates to ""green red red red blue yellow"". Here ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which, similarly to previous examples, results in three ""red,"" and ""dax"" starts the sequence with ""green.""

5. In the fifth example, ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" gives ""green green green red blue green green green."" Both appearances of ""walm"" follow ""dax"" and result each time in two additional ""green.""

From these examples, we can deduce the following rule for ""walm"":

When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", it results in two extra ""green"".
When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", it results in three ""red"".

Therefore, ""walm"" affects the output color depending on the word that precedes it, resulting in multiple appearances of a color.

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" modifies the output based on the preceding word. With ""dax"" before it, ""walm"" results in three green, while with ""wif"" before it, ""walm"" leads to three red.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,28
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example given.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to look at each example and find a consistent rule that explains the corresponding output color(s). Let's examine:

1. ""dax zup bluf"" -> green yellow yellow
2. ""dax walm"" -> green green green
3. ""dax zup dax"" -> green yellow green
4. ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax"" -> red red yellow red blue green
5. ""dax walm zup lug"" -> green green green yellow blue

From the given examples, we can see that every time the word ""dax"" is used, the output is ""green."" In contrast, other words vary in their corresponding colors. For instance:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the first and third examples, but to ""yellow"" in the fourth and ""green"" in the fifth examples.
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" always.
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the first example and ""red"" in the fourth.
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" twice in the fourth example.
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the fourth and fifth examples.

It appears that ""dax"" consistently leads to ""green,"" while other words are not as consistent, perhaps signifying different rules or dependencies.

Rule: dax -> green.

The rule seems to be that ""dax"" means ""green"" or is associated with the color green, regardless of the context in which it appears.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in all of the given examples.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" we can examine the consistent patterns in the examples provided. The output seems to be a series of colors corresponding to the input words. We'll look for a pattern between each input word and its associated color in the output:

1. dax -> green
2. walm -> yellow
3. wif -> red
4. bluf -> yellow
5. lug -> blue

Now let's extract how ""zup"" aligns with the outputs:

1. dax zup walm wif -> green yellow yellow yellow red
2. zup bluf wif dax lug -> yellow yellow red green blue
3. zup wif -> yellow red
4. dax zup lug wif lug -> green yellow blue red blue
5. dax zup wif -> green yellow red

In each instance, the word ""zup"" corresponds with the color yellow in the output. This pattern is consistent across all examples:

zup -> yellow

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns where it appears in the examples.

- In the first example: ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow,"" we can infer that ""bluf"" means ""yellow"" because ""zup"" also means ""yellow"" and it's consistent in the output.
- In the second example: ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow blue yellow yellow,"" ""bluf"" is at the end after a ""zup"" and translates to ""yellow"" again.
- The third example is a repeat of the first.
- In the fourth example: ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" -> ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue,"" we see that ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" resulting in ""green,"" and following ""zup"" or ""wif"" it translated to ""yellow"" and ""red"" respectively.
- In the fifth example: ""wif bluf dax lug"" -> ""red red green blue,"" we see ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and translates to ""red"".

From these observations, it looks like ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word. Therefore:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> The rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it.
walm -> meaning. Rule: The term ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the previous word. Here's the breakdown:

- ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue""; the word ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which translates to ""red"", so ""walm"" also translates to ""red"".
- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue""; ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug"" which is ""blue"".
- ""wif lug walm"" translates to ""red blue blue blue""; again, ""walm"" repeats the color ""blue"" associated with ""lug"".
- ""wif zup walm dax zup"" translates to ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow""; ""walm"" repeats the color ""yellow"" which is associated with ""zup"".
- ""zup lug walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue""; ""walm"" again repeats the color ""blue"" which is associated with ""lug"".

Thus, ""walm"" means: Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm
    ",Output: green green green,green green green,True,29
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Each occurrence of the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
Based on the examples provided, we can infer that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, a ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

Rule: dax -> green.
Rule: wif -> red

Each instance of the word ""wif"" correlates to the output ""red"" in the given examples.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each instance of ""zup"" being used in an input results in ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input string or the presence of other words.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to indicate a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, and the number of repetitions is equal to two. Here's the breakdown of the given examples:

1. ""lug walm wif bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red red""
- The word ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" However, the pattern shows ""blue blue blue"" instead of ""blue green red."" This indicates that the word ""bluf"" caused the word immediately before it, ""wif,"" to be repeated once, resulting in ""red red.""

2. ""dax walm wif bluf"" -> ""green green green red red""
- ""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green,"" and the pattern continues with ""green green green."" Just like the first example, ""bluf"" following ""wif"" results in ""red"" being repeated, hence ""red red.""

3. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" The presence of ""bluf"" after ""lug"" results in ""blue"" being repeated, hence ""blue blue."" Following the same logic, ""zup"" being joined by ""walm"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow,"" as ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

4. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""
- Following the established rule, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" causes the repetition of ""red,"" leading to ""red red.""

5. ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" -> ""green green red yellow red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" causes the repetition of ""green,"" resulting in ""green green."" Similarly, ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow,"" but it is not followed by ""bluf,"" so no repetition occurs based on the established rule.

Rule: bluf -> Causes the word immediately preceding it to repeat once.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can look at each example and pinpoint the commonality between them. Specifically, we should analyze the position and repetition of ""walm"" and how it corresponds to the colors in the output.

In the first example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green."" Here, we know that ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" but the repetition suggests that ""walm"" may be a rule for repetition.

In the second example, ""dax lug wif walm"" gives us ""green blue red red red."" We see that after the word ""walm,"" the color ""red"" is repeated. Prior to that, no repetition is present.

In the third example, ""wif walm zup walm"" leads to ""red red red yellow yellow yellow."" Again, after each instance of ""walm,"" the immediately preceding color is repeated two more times.

In the fourth example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" becomes ""yellow yellow red red red."" We notice that ""walm"" causes the preceding color ""red"" to be repeated two additional times.

In the fifth example, ""dax walm wif dax"" results in ""green green green red green."" After ""walm,"" the previously mentioned color ""green"" is repeated, confirming that ""walm"" is associated with repetition.

Considering the patterns, it seems that ""walm"" instructs the repetition of the color word that comes immediately before it. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: walm -> The word immediately before ""walm"" is repeated three times in total within the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,30
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word 'lug' in the examples is consistently translated into the color 'blue'.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we will look for patterns in the examples provided, focusing particularly on the outputs associated with ""dax.""

In the first example:
- Input: dax walm
- Output: green green green

The word ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output is ""green green green."" However, there is not enough information from this example alone because we have two words in the input and three ""green"" in the output, meaning ""walm"" could contribute to the multiple ""green"" outputs. Let's move to the next examples.

In the second example:
- Input: lug dax wif lug
- Output: blue green red blue

Here, the word ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"" both times it appears. The word ""wif"" is associated with ""red."" So, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" again.

In the third example:
- Input: lug dax lug
- Output: blue green blue

The word ""lug"" is still associated with ""blue,"" and the single ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" again.

In the fourth example:
- Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
- Output: yellow blue red green green red

""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green"" again. Since ""bluf"" is followed by ""green red,"" we can deduce that ""bluf"" doesn't correspond to a single color but rather influences the following word.

In the fifth example:
- Input: dax zup lug wif lug
- Output: green yellow blue red blue

Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Based on these examples, the word ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of the position or context in which it appears. Therefore, we can deduce:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" translates to the word ""red."" When ""wif"" appears in the input, the output always contains the word ""red"" in the corresponding position. Each of the other words in the input (""zup,"" ""dax,"" ""bluf,"" ""lug,"" ""walm"") translate to a different color (""yellow,"" ""green,"" ""green,"" ""blue,"" ""red red red"" respectively).

Considering the translation for each input instance:

- ""zup wif"" becomes ""yellow red""
- In the sequence ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"", each word corresponds to a unique color, including ""wif,"" which translates to ""red.""
- ""wif zup lug zup lug"" translates each word to ""red yellow blue yellow blue"" with ""wif"" specifically becoming ""red.""
- ""dax wif walm"" translates to ""green red red red"" with ""wif"" once again becoming ""red.""
- ""lug wif"" becomes ""blue red.""

Hence, the rule induction suggests:

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" can be deduced as follows:

- When the input ""zup"" is seen by itself, the output is ""yellow"".
- When ""zup"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""lug"" (Input: wif zup lug), ""wif"" is transformed into ""red"", ""zup"" into ""yellow"", and ""lug"" into ""blue"".
- When ""zup"" is part of a sequence with ""wif"" and ""dax"" (Input: wif dax zup wif), ""wif"" is ""red"", ""dax"" is ""green"", and ""zup"" is ""yellow"".

Given that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"" irrespective of the other words in the sequence, it can be concluded that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" without any additional context-dependence.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze how its presence changes the output in each example:

1. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red
   Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" There are two instances of ""red"" following ""bluf"" in the output.

2. dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow
   ""Bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" and again, ""wif"" is paired with ""red.""

3. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
   ""Bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which is again paired with ""red.""

4. zup bluf wif dax wif zup -> yellow yellow red green red yellow
   ""Bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" and once more, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

5. dax lug wif bluf -> green blue red red
   ""Bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red.""

In each instance, ""bluf"" follows the word ""wif,"" and the output consistently shows ""red red"" following this sequence. This pattern suggests that ""bluf"" results in doubling the color associated with ""wif."" Since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" seems to indicate repetition of that color.

Rule: bluf -> causes the color corresponding to the word just before ""bluf"" to be repeated in the output. Since ""wif"" always precedes ""bluf"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" causes ""red"" to be repeated.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to examine the patterns in which the word is used and the corresponding output:

1. ""zup wif walm"" outputs ""yellow red red red."" We know that ""zup"" and ""wif"" have been used in other contexts with the output ""yellow"" and ""red"" respectively. Therefore, the repetition of ""red"" three times suggests a pattern related to ""walm.""

2. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" outputs ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow."" In this case, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The sequence of three ""yellow"" after ""zup"" again follows the previous pattern seen with ""walm.""

3. ""zup wif walm lug"" outputs ""yellow red red red blue."" Here the order of ""zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""walm"" is the same as the first example but ends with ""lug,"" which we know to correspond to ""blue."" Since the three ""red"" colors stay consistent, we can tell that ""lug"" does not influence the result of ""walm.""

4. The repetition of the third example with the same output confirms the pattern observed.

5. ""lug walm wif bluf"" outputs ""blue blue blue red red."" ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" There is no new information for ""bluf,"" but ""walm"" is adjacent to two ""blue"" in the output, which indicates its value relative to its position.

Based on these examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" likely represents a repeating value of the color that precedes it. Each time ""walm"" appears, it repeats the value (color coded) that was last mentioned before it.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the previously mentioned color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup walm
    ",Output: red yellow yellow yellow,red yellow yellow yellow,True,31
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we need to determine the meaning or rule behind the use of the word ""lug."" By analyzing each input and its corresponding output sequence, we can identify patterns and deduce the meaning of ""lug.""

From the examples:
- When ""lug"" appears after ""bluf,"" the corresponding color is ""blue.""
- When ""lug"" appears after ""walm,"" the corresponding color is ""blue.""
- When ""lug"" appears after ""zup,"" the corresponding color is ""yellow.""
- When ""lug"" appears after ""dax,"" the corresponding color is ""green.""
- When ""lug"" appears alone or after ""wif,"" the corresponding color is ""blue.""

It seems that the meaning of ""lug"" isn't fixed but depends on the word that comes before it. However, if ""lug"" appears first or after ""wif,"" the color is consistently ""blue."" Analyzing the data, one could assume that ""lug"" means ""blue,"" given that the majority of the time, irrespective of context, ""lug"" is translated to ""blue."" However, this isn't sufficient since there are context-dependent cases.

Let's refine our analysis by identifying the relationship consistently that holds for each predecessor to ""lug"":

- After ""bluf,"" ""lug"" is ""blue.""
- After ""walm,"" ""lug"" is ""blue.""
- After ""zup,"" ""lug"" is ""yellow.""
- After ""dax,"" ""lug"" is ""green.""
- After ""wif,"" ""lug"" is ""blue.""

The colors after ""lug"" are the same as the corresponding output for the word just before ""lug"" except when ""dax"" precedes ""lug"" it translates to ""green"" instead of ""red"" which is ""dax"" usual output. It is also the same as ""wif"" usual output.

The most consistent rule seems to be that ""lug"" generally signifies ""blue,"" but it can take on a different meaning dependent on the preceding word.

So, the rule for ""lug"" could be:
Rule: ""lug"" typically means ""blue,"" but when following specific words (""dax""), it can mean a different color (""green""). When it follows ""zup,"" ""lug"" takes the color ""yellow"" which is the regular output for ""zup."" The special exception to this rule is the word ""dax"" which changes the color from its regular ""red"" to ""green."" If ""lug"" is preceded by ""wif"" or appears at the beginning, it defaults to ""blue."" This suggests that ""wif"" has no influence on the color represented by ""lug."" 

Therefore: lug -> blue (default), but context-dependent exceptions exist when preceded by certain words.
Based on the examples provided, we see that every instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output. Regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words surrounding it, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green."" There are no examples where ""dax"" leads to any other output.

Therefore, the rule can be defined as:
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the presence of the nonce word ""wif"" causes the output to contain the color ""red."" Moreover, it appears that other nonces output different colors, but consistently the same color for the same nonce:

- ""lug wif walm"" outputs blue red red red, suggesting ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" to red, and ""walm"" to red.
- ""dax wif"" outputs green red, so ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""wif"" to red.
- ""dax wif bluf"" outputs green red red, meaning ""bluf"" also leads to red.
- ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" outputs yellow yellow yellow blue red red, which implies ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" still to blue, and both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" to the red once again.
- ""wif dax"" ouputs red green, which is consistent with ""wif"" corresponding to red and ""dax"" to green when the word order is reversed.

Thus, the ""wif"" has a consistent association with the color ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> corresponds to the color ""red"".
Based on the given examples, each input word corresponds to a specific output color. The word ""zup"" consistently results in the output ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words around it. Therefore, we can establish the following rule:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in every given context.
Rule: The meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to doubling the output color of the word that directly precedes it.

Here are the examples broken down:

1. ""dax zup bluf"" becomes ""green yellow yellow"" - bluf duplicates the color of ""zup"", which is yellow.
2. ""lug bluf"" becomes ""blue blue"" - bluf duplicates the color of ""lug"", which is blue.
3. ""wif bluf lug zup"" becomes ""red red blue yellow"" - bluf duplicates the color of ""wif"", which is red.
4. ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" becomes ""yellow blue red green green red"" - bluf duplicates the color of ""dax"", which is green.
5. ""dax wif bluf"" becomes ""green red red"" - bluf duplicates the color of ""wif"", which is red.

Therefore, the rule is:
bluf -> duplicates the color of the preceding word.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to be a repeater of the color associated with the word that appears immediately before it.

For each example, the output repeats the color associated with the word before ""walm"" the number of times that correspond to how many times ""walm"" appears. The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" and ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Let's verify this rule with the examples given:

- In the first and third examples, ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue,"" which means that ""walm"" causes the word ""lug"" (resulting in ""blue"") to be said three times.
- In the second example, ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green,"" confirming that ""walm"" repeats the color ""green"" associated with ""dax"" three times.
- In the fourth example, ""dax lug walm"" gives us a sequence ""green blue blue blue,"" which suggests that the ""walm"" is affecting only the word that comes immediately before it (in this case ""lug""), repeating its associated color ""blue"" three times, and ""dax"" is unaffected and appears only once as ""green.""
- Finally, in the last example, ""dax walm wif bluf"" outputs ""green green green red red,"" which indicates that ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times, and ""bluf"" which is not followed by ""walm"" is repeated only twice, indicated by ""red red.""

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: walm -> Causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times. If ""walm"" is repeated, it multiplies the repetition for each occurrence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be that each word corresponds to a specific color. The word 'lug' consistently corresponds to the color 'blue' in every example.

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the outputs. Regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence or the presence of other words, the output for ""dax"" is always ""green.""

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
Rule: zup -> yellow

The examples consistently show that whenever the word ""zup"" is present in the input, the output is ""yellow."" Regardless of the order of words or the presence of other words (""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""wif,"" ""bluf""), ""zup"" always corresponds to the output ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the repetition of the color that precedes it. Here is the pattern:

- ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue""
- ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red""
- ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green""
- ""zup bluf"" is not given, but based on the pattern, it would likely correspond to ""yellow yellow""

Therefore, the rule for the word ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color word that immediately precedes ""bluf"".

Rule: If X is a color word, then ""X bluf"" means ""X X"" (the color word is repeated).
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the pattern in each input and corresponding output:

1. ""lug dax walm"" produces ""blue green green green""
2. ""lug walm wif bluf"" produces ""blue blue blue red red""
3. ""wif lug walm"" produces ""red blue blue blue""
4. ""zup wif walm"" produces ""yellow red red red""
5. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" produces ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""

Analysis:
- In examples 1, 3, and 4, ""walm"" is followed by multiple occurrences of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it.
- In example 2, the appearance of ""wif"" (red) and ""bluf"" (red) after ""walm"" does not follow the same replication pattern as the colors before ""walm.""
- In example 5, ""walm"" is followed by the repetition of the color ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup"" before it, but disrupted by the presence of ""dax"" and ""wif bluf"" towards the end.

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to be repeated, but this effect can be disrupted by other color-indicating words occurring after ""walm."" 

Rule: walm -> causes the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" to repeat until another color word appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Rules:

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" is associated with the color ""blue."" Each instance of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that:

- The output always ends with ""red"" when the input ends with ""wif"".
- The number of ""red"" outputs increases with the presence of the term ""wif"" in the input.
- Other words in the examples (""zup"", ""bluf"", ""walm"", ""dax"") seem to correspond with their own unique colors (""yellow"", ""yellow"", ""red"", ""green"").
- It appears that ""wif"" does not alter the output associated with other words when those words come before ""wif"". It could be the case that each word has a predetermined color output.

Given these observations, the following rule can be induced:

Rule:
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
- The meaning of ""wif"" does not seem to depend on the context; it consistently translates to ""red"" regardless.

Therefore:

wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

- zup dax lug -> yellow green blue
- dax zup dax zup wif -> green yellow green yellow red
- zup dax lug dax -> yellow green blue green
- zup dax lug walm zup -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow
- dax zup lug bluf -> green yellow blue blue

In each of these examples, 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow'.
To figure out what ""bluf"" means, we'll first look at the patterns for the other words in the examples:

- ""wif"" consistently results in ""red""
- ""zup"" consistently results in ""yellow""
- ""lug"" consistently results in ""blue""
- ""dax"" appears once and results in ""green""

Now, looking at the outputs corresponding to ""bluf"":

1. ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"". Since ""wif"" is ""red"", ""bluf"" also results in ""red"".
2. ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" results in ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue"". We know that ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""lug"" is ""blue"". If we fill those in, we see that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in this sequence.
3. The third example is the same as the first one.
4. ""dax wif bluf"" gives us ""green red red"". We know ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""wif"" is ""red"", so again ""bluf"" means ""red"" here.
5. ""wif lug zup bluf"" corresponds to ""red blue yellow yellow"". With ""wif"" being ""red"", ""lug"" being ""blue"", and ""zup"" being ""yellow"", ""bluf"" in this instance is ""yellow"".

Looking at the outputs, it seems like ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it. In examples 1, 3, and 4, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", which translates to ""red"", thus ""bluf"" is ""red"". In examples 2 and 5, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", which translates to ""yellow"", making ""bluf"" also ""yellow"".

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" repeats the color of the word immediately before it.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's start by examining the outputs and looking for patterns.

1. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue
It seems that ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" stands for ""red."" However, since ""bluf"" also translates to ""blue,"" this suggests that ""wif"" may operate conditionally based on its position rather than universally translating to ""red."" Alternatively, ""bluf"" might be a different form of ""blue"" used in this system.

2. dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue blue yellow red
Here ""dax"" seems to translate to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and as stated before, ""lug"" to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

3. zup lug walm wif walm -> yellow blue blue blue red red red
Similarly to the previous examples, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" with ""wif"" being ""red."" However, we see that ""walm"" produces a repeated output of the color immediately preceding it.

4. dax walm -> green green green
In this example, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats this color thrice. This supports the interpretation that ""walm"" repeats the colour immediately preceding it three times.

5. zup dax lug walm zup -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow
Similar pattern where ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" generates three ""blue"" in a row, furthering the pattern observed previously.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,34
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, the term ""green"" is used in the output. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""dax"" appears following ""walm,"" and ""green"" follows ""yellow,"" which is the color associated with ""zup.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" is the second item and is followed by ""green,"" while ""wif"" and ""lug"" correspond with ""red"" and ""blue,"" respectively.
- In the third example, both ""dax"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" is at the end and corresponds to ""green,"" just as ""wif"" and ""lug"" map to ""red"" and ""blue.""
- Lastly, when ""dax"" appears alone, the output is ""green.""

So the rule is:

dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" means ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" consistently in every provided example.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's look at the consistent patterns across the given examples.

1. Whenever ""zup"" appears, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output. 
2. It doesn't seem to matter where ""zup"" appears in the input; ""yellow"" is always the corresponding output.
3. Other words have their own consistent mappings. For example, ""lug"" always maps to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" always maps to ""red.""

Based on these observations, ""zup"" does not depend on the context or the position in the sequence; it consistently maps to the word ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Analyzing the input and output sequences provided, it seems like each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. By comparing the sequences, we can deduce the color associated with each word. Let's focus on identifying the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"":

1. In all the sequences that contain ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow"" immediately following the position of ""bluf.""
2. ""wif"" always correlates with the output ""red,” irrespective of its position in the sequence.
3. ""zup"" is consistently associated with the output ""yellow"" when it occurs in the sequence.
4. In all instances where ""bluf"" is followed by another word except ""wif,"" the output color is ""green.""

Given the examples, it appears that ""bluf"" might cause the output to repeat the preceding color. To clarify:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which outputs ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" also outputs ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" again, which outputs ""yellow,"" hence ""bluf"" outputs ""yellow"" as well.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" too.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is the second word following ""dax,"" and the color for ""dax"" which is ""green"" is outputted again for ""bluf.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which correlates with ""red,"" and ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" as well.

Rule: bluf -> The output color for ""bluf"" is the same as the output color for the word immediately preceding it.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" affects the output by repeating the color word that appears just before it a number of times. Specifically, ""walm"" seems to cause the previous color word to repeat three times. Here is the analysis:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"", indicating that ""lug"" (blue) is repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"", indicating that ""wif"" (red) is repeated three times.
- In the third example, we see the pattern continue with ""wif walm"" resulting in ""red red red"" and ""zup walm"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""wif walm"" again results in ""red red red"".
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" once again, confirming the pattern.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,35
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug."" It seems that every instance of ""lug"" is translated to ""blue."" No context is provided that changes the meaning of ""lug"" when other words are present. Therefore, the simplest rule that fits all the given examples is:

lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever ""lug"" is encountered in input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
From the examples provided, we can infer a pattern in which each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output.

- In the first example, the word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the second example, the consistency is maintained with ""lug"" still mapping to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""
- The third example reinforces the association of ""zup"" with ""yellow"" and ""dax"" with ""green.""
- The fourth example introduces a new word ""bluf,"" but ""dax"" and ""wif"" still map to ""green"" and ""red,"" respectively. ""Bluf"" appears to correspond to ""red"" based on this single instance.
- The fifth example confirms again that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Therefore, based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we'll analyze the patterns in the given examples as follows:

1. ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" -> ""blue blue blue green red blue red""
2. ""zup wif dax walm"" -> ""yellow red green green green""
3. ""wif lug wif"" -> ""red blue red""
4. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
5. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red""

Now, let's try to find the rule for ""wif"" by comparing the input and the output strings.

1. When ""wif"" is before ""lug,"" the corresponding color is ""red.""
   In ""lug walm dax wif lug wif,"" ""wif lug"" corresponds to ""red blue,"" and the second instance of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
2. ""wif"" alone corresponds to ""red,"" as seen in ""wif lug wif"" and ""wif walm,"" where each ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red.""
3. When ""wif"" follows a different word (""lug"" excluded), it turns into the color before it:
   In ""lug walm dax wif lug wif,"" ""wif"" after ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" which is the color assigned to ""dax.""
   In ""zup wif dax walm,"" ""wif"" after ""zup"" corresponds to ""red,"" the color for ""zup.""
   In ""lug walm zup lug zup wif,"" ""wif"" after ""zup"" corresponds to ""red,"" which is the color for ""zup.""

Based on this pattern, it seems ""wif"" takes the color of the word before it, with the exception that ""wif"" before ""lug"" makes it ""red.""

Rule: wif -> takes the color of the preceding word, but if followed by ""lug,"" the color is ""red.""
Based on the examples given:

1. When zup appears after the words lug wif dax walm, the sequence of colors is blue red green green green yellow. Here, we notice that lug corresponds to blue, wif to red, dax to green, walm again to green, and following walm, zup corresponds to yellow.

2. When zup appears alone, the output is yellow. This suggests that zup by itself translates directly to yellow.

3. When dax is followed by zup, and this pattern is repeated, the output sequence is green yellow green yellow. Here, dax corresponds to green each time, and zup to yellow, following the pattern set by dax.

4. When dax is followed by zup and then by bluf, the output is green yellow yellow. In this case, dax is green, zup remains yellow, and bluf is also yellow.

5. When dax is followed by bluf, then wif, and finally zup, the output is green green red yellow. Here, dax is green, bluf is green, wif is red, and zup is yellow.

From these examples, we can deduce:

Rule: zup corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it.

zup -> yellow
Based on the inputs and their corresponding outputs, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color word that immediately precedes it. When the word ""bluf"" appears after another color word, the output is that color word repeated twice.

For ""dax lug bluf"", the output was ""green blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

In ""wif bluf lug zup"", the word ""bluf"" came after ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"", hence the output ""red red"" followed by ""blue"" for ""lug"" and ""yellow"" for ""zup.""

For ""dax bluf"", the output was ""green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

For ""lug bluf"", the output was ""blue blue"" again, as ""lug"" matches ""blue.""

Lastly, for ""wif lug bluf"", the output was ""red blue blue"" because ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", which corresponds to ""blue"" as well.

So, we can deduce the following rule:

bluf -> meaning: Repetition of the color word that immediately precedes ""bluf"".
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to correlate with the color represented by the word preceding it. Each time ""walm"" is used, the output is a repetition of the color that correlates with the word just before it, repeated three times. Here are the specifics based on the input and the output patterns:

1. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"", and ""walm"" leads to the repetition of ""yellow"" three times.
2. ""lug walm wif zup wif"" results in ""blue blue blue red yellow red"" - ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"", so ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times. ""zup"" is ""yellow"", and ""wif"" appears to be ""red"".
3. ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" results in ""blue blue blue green red blue red"" - again ""lug"" before ""walm"" leads to ""blue"" being repeated three times, and ""dax"" seems to be ""green"".
4. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" results in ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow"" - here ""zup"" comes before ""walm"", hence the repetition of ""yellow"" three times.
5. ""zup wif walm lug"" results in ""yellow red red red blue"" - this is a deviation from the pattern because ""walm"" doesn't immediately follow ""zup"". Instead, it seems that the color before ""walm"" is not to be considered, and the following word's color, which is ""lug"" correlating with ""blue"", is to be considered here. However, ""red red"" doesn't follow any other discernable pattern, and this may indicate an exception or a different rule at play for this example.

If we disregard the last example as an anomaly or an exception due to its inconsistency with the other examples, we could infer:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word directly preceding it to be repeated three times.

Therefore:

walm -> Causes the output of the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,36
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Each instance of ""lug"" in the input is translated to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples provided, every time the word ""dax"" appears in input, the word ""green"" is in the corresponding position in the output. Thus, ""dax"" means ""green.""
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's examine the input and outputs given in the examples.

1. In the first example, ""wif"" appears at the beginning and the end, and in both cases, the output is ""red."" This indicates a direct correspondence, suggesting ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

2. In the second example, ""wif"" appears at the beginning and is followed by ""walm,"" with the output being ""red red red,"" which indicates that ""walm"" might also correspond to ""red,"" given that the sequence ""wif walm"" results in ""red red.""

3. The third example doesn't introduce new information about ""wif,"" but it confirms that ""wif"" is at the end and still corresponds to ""red.""

4. The fourth example includes ""wif"" in the second position, and its output is ""red"" once again, reinforcing that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" regardless of its position.

5. The fifth example adds more evidence that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" as ""wif walm zup lug wif"" results in ""red red red yellow blue red,"" with the final ""wif"" also translating to ""red.""

There are no examples given that show ""wif"" corresponding to any color other than ""red."" Therefore, based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow."" The other words, such as ""wif,"" ""dax,"" ""lug,"" and ""walm,"" correspond to other colors based on their placement within the sequence, regardless of the presence of ""zup.""

Here's the breakdown:

- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" seems to always translate to ""red.""
- ""dax"" corresponds with ""green.""
- ""lug"" appears to translate to ""blue.""
- ""walm,"" when occurring before ""lug,"" generates multiple instances of ""red"" (in the sequence ""red red red"") followed by ""blue.""

The examples do not provide instances of ""walm"" without ""lug"" following it, so it's unclear whether ""walm"" always results in ""red red red"" or if it produces a repetition of ""red"" a specific number of times depending on the word that follows.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided and the associated outputs, it appears that ""bluf"" translates to a color, and that color is determined by the word following ""bluf."" Here's a breakdown of the evidence:

- In the first example, ""bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow red,"" rendering ""bluf"" as ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" rendering ""bluf"" as ""red.""
- In the third example, we see ""wif bluf dax"" translating to ""green red red green,"" where ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""dax,"" making ""bluf"" ""red"" again.
- In the fourth example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" rendering ""bluf"" as ""yellow"" once more.
- Lastly, in the fifth example, ""dax bluf wif"" translates to ""green green red,"" where ""bluf"" works similarly to ""dax"" as ""green.""

Given these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately following it. If no word follows ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" takes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. If we try to set up a general rule, it would be:

bluf -> The color of the following word; if there is no following word, then the color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf takes the color of the word following it; if there is no following word, it takes the color of the word before it.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the given examples and the corresponding outputs to identify any potential relationships between the inputs and outputs.

- In the first example, ""dax walm zup lug"" outputs ""green green green yellow blue,"" and ""dax"" seems to correspond with ""green."" Notice that the word ""lug"" appears after ""walm"" and before ""zup,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" Therefore, the sequence ""walm zup lug"" is reflected in the output as ""green yellow blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" may not be changing the color associated with the words that follow it and green represents the color associated with ""walm.""

- In the second example, ""dax walm wif"" outputs ""green green green red."" Here ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and the sequence ""walm wif"" results in ""green red."" Again, ""walm"" is preceded by ""green.""

- In the third example, ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" results in an output of ""green,"" but in this example, all of the outputs are ""blue."" This suggests that ""walm"" may take on the color of the word that precedes it.

- In the fourth example, ""lug walm zup lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" follows the pattern of the previous word's color.

- In the fifth example, ""zup wif dax walm lug"" outputs ""yellow red green green green blue."" Here ""lug"" follows ""walm"" and ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" but the output is ""green blue,"" suggesting again that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word before it (""dax,"" which is ""green"").

Based on these examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the given sequence. If there is no word before ""walm,"" it defaults to ""green.""

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word, or ""green"" if there is no preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,37
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce a rule for what ""dax"" means in this context:

1. When ""dax"" is present with ""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" and ""lug,"" the corresponding output is ""green yellow red red blue.""
2. When ""dax"" is present alone, the output is ""green.""
3. When ""dax"" follows ""zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""lug,"" the colors for the other words remain consistent with their order in example 1, but ""dax"" at the end still corresponds to ""green.""
4. When ""dax"" follows ""lug"" and ""wif,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""dax"" is ""green.""
5. When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" an unknown word, the output is ""green green green.""

Considering the consistency of the output ""green"" whenever ""dax"" is present, despite the order or the presence of other words, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green

This means that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position or the other words present. This rule is corroborated by each instance where ""dax"" results in the color ""green"" in the output.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, we can induce a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" by comparing each input with its corresponding output.

1. ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" which infers that both ""zup"" and ""bluf"" translate to ""yellow.""
2. ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red green red red."" We know that ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and we can infer ""wif"" to be ""red"" and ""dax"" to be ""green."" This means ""bluf"" in this context also translates to ""red.""
3. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" From this, ""walm"" and ""lug"" are inferred to be ""yellow,"" ""wif"" remains ""red,"" and thus ""bluf"" must translate to ""red"" given the presence of ""wif"" before it.
4. ""wif dax bluf"" translates to ""red green green."" Here, ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""dax"" is ""green."" Since ""bluf"" results in ""green"" in this context, it cannot have a fixed meaning and must depend on the preceding word(s).
5. ""zup bluf"" translates again into ""yellow yellow,"" reaffirming the initial observation from example 1, again suggesting ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup.""

Given these observations, there seems to be a pattern that the meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the preceding word:

- When following ""zup,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""
- When following ""wif,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""
- When following ""dax,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""green.""
- There is no instance given following ""walm"" or ""lug,"" so we cannot determine how ""bluf"" behaves in those contexts.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" can be summarized as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the immediately preceding word. If the preceding word is ""zup,"" the meaning is ""yellow""; if ""wif,"" the meaning is ""red""; if ""dax,"" the meaning is ""green.""
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we must look at the patterns involving this word in the given inputs and their corresponding outputs.

From the input ""dax walm,"" we infer that ""walm"" could be related to the repetition of the color ""green."" To test this hypothesis, we should look for another occurrence of ""dax"" without ""walm"" to see its output, but such an example is not provided.

From the input ""lug walm dax wif lug wif,"" we see that the output is ""blue blue blue green red blue red,"" hence the presence of ""walm"" appears to correspond to the repetition of ""blue"" exactly three times, as ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

In the input ""zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" and similarly to the first example, ""walm"" leads to ""yellow"" being repeated three times.

From ""dax wif walm,"" the output is ""green red red red,"" which means ""walm"" here corresponds to ""red"" being repeated three times after ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""red"" for ""wif.""

And finally, the input ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" has ""blue blue blue"" for ""lug walm,"" followed by ""red"" for ""wif,"" and ""blue blue"" for ""lug bluf,"" hence ""walm"" here again corresponds to the repetition of a color associated with the preceding word three times.

The rule appears that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the directly preceding word to repeat three times. Using this rule induction, we can summarize the pattern as follows:

Rule: walm -> leads to the repetition of the color associated with the directly preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine the color associated with it in each example:

- In the first example, ""dax walm lug"" maps to ""green green green blue,"" and ""dax"" is associated with green.
- In the second example, ""dax lug zup"" maps to ""green blue yellow,"" and ""dax"" is once again associated with green.
- In the third example, ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" maps to ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" maps to ""red red green green red red red blue red,"" and ""dax"" again corresponds to green.
- In the fifth example, ""zup dax"" maps to ""yellow green,"" and ""dax"" is connected with green once more.

Based on the color associations in all examples, the rule for ""dax"" remains consistent; it always maps to green, regardless of its position or the words around it.

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Other words in the sequence correspond to different colors, and their translation is seemingly dependent on their position or specific identity. ""Zup"" correlates to yellow, ""dax"" to green, and ""lug"" to blue. The position of ""wif"" does not affect its translation; it always translates to ""red"".
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow

Meaning, whenever the word ""zup"" is encountered, it translates to the color ""yellow.""
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's begin by observing the correspondence between the inputs and outputs in the given examples. We notice that whenever ""bluf"" is present, the output is a duplication of the color that precedes it. Here's a breakdown:

1. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
2. ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red""
3. ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue""
4. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""green red yellow yellow red red red""
5. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""

From these examples, we see that the color word immediately preceding ""bluf"" is always repeated in the output. Thus, ""bluf"" appears to signal a duplication of the previous color word.

Rule: bluf -> causes the previous color word to be repeated in the output.
To determine what ""walm"" means in the series of examples, we need to compare the inputs with their corresponding output. The context in which ""walm"" is used and the resulting color associations in the output should help us deduce a pattern or rule.

- In the first example, ""wif walm zup"" leads to ""red red red yellow"". The word ""walm"" appears between ""wif"" and ""zup"", with ""wif"" and ""walm"" leading to ""red red red"", and ""zup"" changing the pattern to ""yellow"".
  
- In the second example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"". There aren't other words to compare ""walm"" with, but ""lug"" and ""walm"" together result in three blues.

- In the third example, ""dax wif walm"" gives us ""green red red red"". Here ""dax"" is associated with green, and ""wif walm"" with three reds.

- The fourth example is identical to the second, reinforcing that ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"".

- In the fifth example, ""lug walm zup walm"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow"". Here, we see ""lug walm"" again associated with ""blue blue blue"". When ""zup"" appears it changes the color to yellow, and ""walm"" following ""zup"" is also associated with yellow.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word. Explicitly:

- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"", repeating the red associated with ""wif"".
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"", repeating the blue from ""lug"".
- ""walm"" following the color change induced by ""zup"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"", repeating the yellow.

Therefore, we can posit the following rule: 

Rule: ""walm"" takes on the color of the preceding word or maintains the existing color pattern if associated with a word that has a color pattern.

walm -> maintains the color of the preceding word or color pattern.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,39
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, where ""lug"" corresponds to an output in the sentence, it appears that ""lug"" is translated to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sentence or the other words present. 

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the examples provided:

1. ""zup dax walm"" yields ""yellow green green green""
2. ""wif dax wif lug wif"" yields ""red green red blue red""
3. ""dax"" by itself yields ""green""
4. ""dax"" by itself again yields ""green""
5. ""zup dax walm lug wif"" yields ""yellow green green green blue red""

It seems that independent of context or position, the word ""dax"" always results in the output ""green."" This suggests that the meaning or rule associated with ""dax"" is consistent and not influenced by preceding or following words.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each nonce word (dax, wif, walm, lug, zup) maps directly to a color. Looking at the instances where ""wif"" appears, we can try to deduce its meaning according to the output:

- In the first example ""dax wif"" maps to ""green red"". Since ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green"" in all the other examples, we can infer that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- The second example reinforces this as ""wif"" appears alone and maps directly to ""red"".
- The third, fourth, and fifth examples also consistently map ""wif"" to ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Based on these observations, we can conclude the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". In each instance where ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output.

Here is the rule induction based on the examples:

- ""dax zup walm wif walm"" results in ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red"". ""Zup"" corresponds to the first ""yellow"".
- ""dax walm zup lug"" results in ""green green green yellow blue"". ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" after three ""green"" colors.
- ""zup"" on its own results in ""yellow"".
- ""lug zup"" results in ""blue yellow"", where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" following ""blue"".
- ""wif walm dax zup"" results in ""red red red green yellow"", where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" following ""green"" after three ""red"" colors.

Based on these observations the rule is:
zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the provided examples, the following rules can be deduced for each input word:

- zup outputs ""yellow""
- dax outputs ""green""
- lug outputs ""blue""
- wif outputs ""red""
- walm outputs ""red red red""

Given the consistency of the output regardless of the position of ""bluf"" in the input, we can deduce that ""bluf"" has a fixed meaning. In every instance where ""bluf"" is used, the output is ""yellow yellow"". This indicates that ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""yellow yellow"" regardless of context, suggesting that ""bluf"" simply means ""yellow yellow"" in this set of rules.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" can be written as:

Rule: bluf -> ""yellow yellow""
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color that precedes it. In other words, ""walm"" seems to indicate that whatever color is mentioned before ""walm"" should be repeated.

Let's observe the examples and how ""walm"" functions in each:

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   Here, ""lug"" (blue) is followed by ""walm"" and the output repeats ""blue"" before moving on to the next color, ""dax"" (green).

2. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red
   ""Dax"" (green) is followed by ""walm"" and is repeated in the output.

3. Input: wif walm zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
   Both ""wif"" (red) and ""zup"" (yellow) are followed by ""walm"" resulting in a repetition of ""red"" and then ""yellow.""

4. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red
   ""Lug"" (blue) is followed by ""walm"" resulting in the repetition of ""blue.""

5. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   ""Zup"" (yellow) is followed by ""walm"" and its repetition occurs before ""wif"" (red), which is then followed by another ""walm"" causing ""red"" to be repeated.

Rule: walm -> Causes the previous color word to be repeated in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,40
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look closely at each example given to see how it translates to its output color.

Example analysis:

1. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue red green green red
   Here, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf wif,"" and the corresponding output is ""green green"".

2. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red
   Here, ""dax"" is followed by ""wif,"" and the output is ""green red.""

3. Input: dax bluf lug wif
   Output: green green blue red
   Here, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the output for ""dax bluf"" is ""green green.""

4. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
   Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
   In this example, ""dax"" follows ""wif"" and precedes another ""wif,"" with the corresponding output for ""dax wif"" being ""green red.""

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   In this final example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and the corresponding output is ""green green green.""

From these examples, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of ""dax"":

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color green. If ""dax"" is followed by another word (that is not itself a color word like ""wif"" or ""bluf""), the color associated with ""dax"" is repeated for the following word (as seen in example 3 with ""dax bluf"" and example 5 with ""dax walm""). If ""dax"" is followed by a word that represents a color (""wif"" or ""bluf""), it does not seem to affect the translation of the following color word (as seen in examples 1 and 4).

Thus, we can conclude that ""dax"" represents the color green, but when it's followed by another word that doesn't represent a color, it means that word is also associated with the color green.

So, the rule for ""dax"" is:

Rule: dax -> green. When followed by a non-color word, repeat the color green for the following word.
Based on the examples given, each nonce word seems to be consistently translated to a specific color. Here is the apparent mapping from the provided examples:

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> red
- dax -> green

From these examples, it's clear that the word ""wif"" always translates to ""red."" However, it is interesting to note that ""walm"" also translates to ""red."" This might suggest that there is more to the rule underlying the translation of ""wif"" and ""walm"" or that they are synonymous in this specific context. But with the limited information provided and focusing only on the word ""wif,"" the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of ""zup"":

- When ""zup"" appears after a word, the output color for ""zup"" is yellow.
- The color output for other words is consistent regardless of the presence of ""zup"": ""wif"" results in red, ""walm"" in yellow, ""dax"" in green, and ""bluf"" in blue.
- ""Zup"" does not change the output colors of the words preceding it.
- Even when ""zup"" appears on its own, the output is yellow, indicating that ""zup"" always corresponds to yellow, independent of context.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> the color that is described by the preceding word, repeated twice.

Rule: When the word preceding ""bluf"" indicates a color (such as ""lug"" for blue, ""wif"" for red, ""dax"" for green, or ""zup"" for yellow), the output is that color name repeated.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the given examples, let's look at the corresponding output for each occurrence:

Example 1: wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
Example 2: zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
Example 3: zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
Example 4: zup walm dax -> yellow yellow yellow green
Example 5: dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

Analyzing the outputs, we note the following patterns for walm:

1. Whenever ""walm"" appears, ""red"" follows it in the output, except for when ""walm"" is the last word in the input. This suggests that ""walm"" itself triggers a ""red"" output and might mean ""red.""
2. The instances where ""walm"" does not directly precede a ""red"" in the output are those where ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" or ""zup,"" which seem to have their own corresponding colors ""green"" and ""yellow,"" respectively. This could mean that ""dax"" and ""zup"" override the typical output for ""walm.""
3. In Example 5, ""walm"" appears twice, the first time it precedes ""lug,"" causing ""red,"" and the second time it precedes ""zup,"" causing ""yellow."" However, ""lug"" appears after ""walm"" and the output is ""blue."" This might suggest that ""walm"" causes the word that follows it to have its own unique color unless the following word is ""dax"" or ""zup,"" which have predetermined outputs.

Based on these observations the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the following word in the sequence to become ""red"" unless followed by ""dax"" or ""zup,"" which have their own specified colors. If ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence, no color follows.

Thus:
walm -> The rule is “walm” triggers the color “red” for the word that follows it with exceptions for the words ""dax"" and ""zup,"" which have predetermined colors. If ""walm"" is at the end, it has no subsequent color output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif
    ",Output: blue red,blue red,True,41
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position or the context in the examples provided.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other words. Here's the observed correspondence:

Input: wif bluf dax -> Output: red red green
Input: zup dax -> Output: yellow green
Input: dax bluf zup -> Output: green green yellow
Input: dax -> Output: green
Input: dax wif dax -> Output: green red green

Given this consistent pattern, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
Consider each example and its output:

1. Input: lug wif        -> Output: blue red
2. Input: wif bluf zup   -> Output: red red yellow
3. Input: dax walm wif dax -> Output: green green green red green
4. Input: wif lug         -> Output: red blue
5. Input: dax walm wif walm zup -> Output: green green green red red red yellow

Observations:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears, ""red"" is included in the corresponding output.
- ""Wif"" precedes a color word; it changes the next word's corresponding output to ""red"".

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: When ""wif"" precedes another word, the output for the next word is ""red"", regardless of its usual corresponding color. 

Hence, ""wif"" -> an instruction to change the next color word into the color red.
Rule:

Based on the provided examples:
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""walm"" appears to generate repetitions of the preceding color, where the amount of repetition is based on the number of letters in the word following ""zup."" For example, ""walm"" alone results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting each letter in ""walm"" corresponds to an additional ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" although it's only shown once in the examples.

In summary:
- ""zup"" -> yellow.
- ""walm"" following a color word -> repeat the color word as many times as there are letters in ""walm.""
- ""dax"" -> green.
- ""lug"" -> blue.
- ""wif"" -> red (though this rule is less certain due to a single instance).
Rule: bluf -> ""red"" followed by a sequence of the color indicated by the next word in the sequence, repeated the number of letters in that word.

- In the first example, ""bluf dax walm"", bluf translates to ""red"" followed by ""green"" repeated three times (the number of letters in ""dax"").
- In the second example, ""bluf"" on its own translates to ""red"" twice, since there is no following word to indicate a color.
- In the third example, ""bluf lug walm"", bluf translates to ""red"" followed by ""blue"" repeated three times (the number of letters in ""lug"").
- In the fourth example, ""bluf dax lug"", bluf translates to ""red"" followed by ""green"" once (the number of letters in ""dax"").
- In the fifth example, ""dax zup bluf"", bluf translates to ""red"" followed by ""yellow"" twice (the number of letters in ""zup"").

So, the rule seems to be that bluf precedes a sequence and starts with ""red"", and continues with a repetition of the color that corresponds to the next word, repeated as many times as there are letters in that word. If there's no word after bluf referring to a color, it defaults to repeating ""red"".
walm -> meaning: The meaning of ""walm"" appears to cause the word immediately preceding it to repeat its associated color in the output. 

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, the color corresponding to the preceding word is repeated in the output sequence for the number of times ""walm"" is used in succession. If ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output will have an additional ""yellow,"" if it follows ""lug,"" an additional ""blue,"" if it follows ""dax,"" an additional ""green,"" and so on.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the outputs provided.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's analyze the examples given and the corresponding outputs to find a pattern.

1. Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
   Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
   - We see that 'zup' consistently corresponds to 'yellow', and 'bluf' consistently corresponds to 'blue'. 
   - The word 'dax' is followed by 'green' in the output.

2. Input: wif zup dax
   Output: red yellow green
   - Here, 'wif' corresponds to 'red', and 'zup' again corresponds to 'yellow'.
   - 'dax' is again followed by 'green'.

3. Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
   Output: yellow yellow red blue green
   - 'zup' and 'bluf' correspond to 'yellow' and 'red' respectively, 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'.
   - The word 'dax' is once more followed by 'green'.

4. Input: lug dax wif lug
   Output: blue green red blue
   - 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', and 'wif' corresponds to 'red'.
   - 'dax' is again followed by 'green'.

5. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   - 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', and 'zup' and 'wif' correspond to 'yellow' and 'red' respectively.
   - 'dax' is at the beginning of the sequence this time but still corresponds to 'green'.

From these examples, we can deduce that 'dax' consistently corresponds to the color 'green' in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words around it.

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word 'wif'. Let's look at the occurrences of 'wif' in the inputs and their respective outputs:

1. ""dax lug wif"" maps to ""green blue red""
2. ""wif zup wif dax"" maps to ""red yellow red green""
3. ""wif zup"" maps to ""red yellow""
4. ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" maps to ""red yellow yellow red green""
5. ""dax lug wif walm"" maps to ""green blue red red red""

From these examples, we can see that every time the word 'wif' appears, the word 'red' appears in the output. Moreover, 'wif' does not seem to have a positional dependency like coming at the beginning or end of an input to correspond to the output 'red'. Instead, it consistently maps to 'red' regardless of its position.

Rule: wif -> 'red'
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"":

Rule: zup -> yellow

Each instance of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output.
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe that the output 'blue' consistently occurs in the same position as the input 'bluf', regardless of the position of 'bluf' within the input sequence or the words surrounding it. This suggests that 'bluf' maps directly to the color 'blue'.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

bluf -> blue
From the examples provided, it appears that 'walm' replicates the color of the word that immediately precedes it multiple times. Observing the pattern, the replicated color is expressed by the word that comes before 'walm'. The number of times the color is repeated corresponds to the position of 'walm' in the sequence, considering that 'lug', 'zup', and 'dax' each stand consistently for a specific color—'blue', 'yellow', and 'green', respectively. For each position 'walm' takes, it seems to repeat the prior color that many times.

Let's break down the examples:

1. ""lug zup dax walm"" -> ""blue yellow green green green""
'Walm' comes fourth and repeats the color of 'dax', which is green, three times.

2. ""zup lug walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue""
'Walm' comes third and repeats the color of 'lug', which is blue, three times.

3. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
'Walm' comes second and repeats the color of 'lug', which is blue, twice.

4. ""zup dax lug walm zup"" -> ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow""
'Walm' comes fourth and repeats the color of 'lug', which is blue, three times, since it's the fourth word not counting the word 'walm' itself.

5. ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red""
'Walm' comes second and repeats the color of 'zup', which is yellow, twice.

Given the above, the rule for 'walm' seems to be that it replicates the color of the preceding word as many times minus one as its position in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> Replicates the color of the preceding word, repeating it as many times as its position in the sequence minus one.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" 

Rule: lug means blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time the word ""wif"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

Here is the mapping from the input to output in each example:

Input 1: dax wif dax zup bluf -> Output 1: green red green yellow yellow
Input 2: dax zup wif zup -> Output 2: green yellow red yellow
Input 3: wif bluf -> Output 3: red red
Input 4: dax wif -> Output 4: green red
Input 5: lug zup wif zup -> Output 5: blue yellow red yellow

In each case, ""wif"" directly translates to ""red"":

wif -> red
From the examples provided, we can analyze the input and output pairs to determine what ""zup"" translates to in the output.

- In the first example, ""zup wif"" outputs ""yellow red"". ""Wif"" is the only other word, and corresponds to ""red"".
- In the second example, ""dax zup wif"" outputs ""green yellow red"". Here, ""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green"", ""wif"" once again corresponds to ""red"", and ""zup"" is what's left, corresponding to ""yellow"".
- In the third example, ""lug zup lug"" outputs ""blue yellow blue"". This suggests that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""zup"" remains ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" outputs ""yellow yellow red blue green"". As we know from previous examples, ""wif"" is ""red"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", and ""dax"" is ""green"". ""Bluf"" might correspond to ""yellow"", but since ""zup"" should still be ""yellow"", it implies that ""bluf"" is not a color on its own; rather, it is indicative of ""zup"" being repeated, possibly meaning ""again"".
- The fifth example, ""dax zup dax walm"" outputs ""green yellow green green green"". We can see that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", like before. Since ""walm"" follows three ""greens"", it's possible that ""walm"" indicates repeating the previous color thrice.

Given these observations, the rule for ""zup"" seems to consistently be that it translates to the color ""yellow"". Thus, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the duplication of the color that comes after the word ""bluf"" in each Input. Here's a breakdown of how that conclusion was reached:

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" and the Output translates ""wif"" to ""red"" twice, suggesting ""bluf"" means to duplicate the color of the word that follows it.

2. Input: zup dax bluf zup dax
   Output: yellow green green yellow green
   ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup,"" but since ""zup"" appears again after it and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" it's not clear here. However, ""bluf"" is before ""zup"" and results in ""green green"", implying duplication of ""green"" which corresponds to ""dax"".

3. Input: dax lug bluf wif
   Output: green blue blue red
   ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" which results in a duplication of ""blue"" in the Output before ""wif"" changes to ""red.""

4. Input: lug dax bluf
   Output: blue green green
   Again, ""bluf"" precedes ""dax,"" and the Output is green duplicated.

5. Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
   Output: yellow red red yellow blue
   ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup,"" and that results in ""red red,"" which duplicates the color corresponding to ""wif"" that comes before ""bluf.""

So, based on these observations:

Rule: ""bluf"" means to duplicate the color of the word that immediately follows it.

bluf -> Duplicate the color of the following word.
From the given examples, ""walm"" seems to correspond to the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word three times. 

Here are the correlations between the inputs and outputs:

- ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green""
- ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue""
- ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" directly correlates to the color ""green"". Each occurrence of ""dax"" in the input is translated to ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence of words.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rules for the words 'dax', 'bluf', 'zup', and 'lug':

- When 'dax' appears in the input, the output is 'green'.
- When 'bluf' appears in the input, the output is 'yellow'.
- When 'lug' appears in the input, the output is 'blue'.

Looking at the word 'zup', each time it appears in the input, the corresponding output is 'yellow'. However, since we already know that 'bluf' corresponds to yellow as well, we need to differentiate the occurrences. By analyzing the examples, it seems that 'zup' always appears directly before a word that is translated to a color. This suggests that 'zup' does not have a fixed color associated with it, but rather has a rule-based meaning.

The rule is:

- When 'zup' appears in the input before any other word, it takes the color of the following word (e.g., if 'zup' is followed by 'dax', which corresponds to green, then 'zup' generates the output 'yellow'. If 'zup' stands alone or is the last word, it follows the same 'yellow' used for 'bluf').

Thus, the meaning of 'zup' could be interpreted as a ""preview"" or ""indicator"" of the next color to appear. However, since 'zup' never appears at the end or alone in the provided data, we cannot be sure about what happens in these cases, so we will stick to the observed pattern.

Rule: zup -> (see rule above)
Based on the examples provided, each instance of ""bluf"" in the input correlates to the word ""red"" in the output. However, there seems to be inconsistency as the second instance of ""bluf"" in the first example corresponds to ""blue"" rather than ""red"".

Let's consider the context of each example:

- In the first example ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"". The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", but only the second ""blue"" in the output corresponds to ""bluf"".

- In the second example, ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red"". Here ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""bluf"" to ""red"" again.

- The third example has ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"", translating to ""blue blue red blue red red red blue"". Here, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"", while ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"". ""Bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" which may imply that ""bluf"" adopts the color that follows it (i.e., ""bluf"" before ""wif"" yields ""red"").

- The fourth example, ""wif bluf lug zup"", translates to ""red red blue yellow"". Here, ""wif"" is again ""red"", ""lug"" ""blue"", and ""zup"" ""yellow"". ""Bluf"" results in ""red"", which is the color directly following it (""lug"").

- The last example, ""zup walm lug wif bluf"", translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"". ""Zup"" and ""walm"" both correspond to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"" while ""wif"" remains ""red"". The word ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and once again translates to ""red"".

From these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that immediately follows it in the input when there is a word following it. When ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence, it seems to default to the color ""blue"". Nonetheless, the first example (""lug bluf"" to ""blue blue"") contradicts the ""bluf takes the following color"" rule.

Given the contradictions, it's difficult to pinpoint a definitive rule that applies in all cases, but the majority of examples suggest the following based on the given context:

Rule: ""bluf"" represents the color of the word immediately following it, but if there is no word following ""bluf,"" it defaults to ""blue."" This rule is contradicted by the first example, so there may be additional context or rules not captured in these examples that could explain the inconsistency.

Thus tentatively:
bluf -> meaning: The color of the word that follows it in the input; defaults to ""blue"" if at the end.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should closely examine the inputs and their corresponding outputs, looking for patterns that involve ""walm."" Given the examples, we can match each occurrence of ""walm"" to its output color and analyze the context.

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

Here, ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue."" Notably, ""blue"" is repeated three times, matching the number of ""lug"" that come after ""walm.""

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

Once again, ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"" and is followed by two words (""zup"" and ""wif"") which are both translated into colors (""yellow"" and ""red"").

Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow

In this input, ""walm"" occurs twice, and for each occurrence, the output color ""red"" is repeated three times.

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

Here, ""walm"" is at the end and results in three ""red"" colors in the output.

Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow

Similarly, ""walm"" correlates with a repetition of ""green"" three times in the output before changing color after the next word.

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the current color to be repeated three times in the output before moving on to the next color corresponding to the following word.

Rule: walm -> Repetition. The word ""walm"" indicates that the current color is to be repeated three times before moving on to the next color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif walm zup
    ",Output: red red red yellow,red red red yellow,True,45
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples where the input and corresponding output can be matched word-for-word as follows:

1. wif -> red
2. zup -> yellow
3. lug -> blue
4. dax -> green
5. walm -> blue
6. bluf -> red

It is clear that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. Therefore, the rule is:

lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

The examples show that whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" consistently.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we'll analyze each example and look for a pattern.

Example 1:
Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red
Pattern: zup -> yellow, wif -> red, bluf -> red

Example 2:
Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
Output: red yellow yellow red green
Pattern: wif -> red, zup -> yellow, bluf -> yellow, wif -> red, dax -> green

Example 3:
Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow
Pattern: wif -> red, bluf -> red, lug -> blue, zup -> yellow

Example 4:
Input: wif bluf zup
Output: red red yellow
Pattern: wif -> red, bluf -> red, zup -> yellow

Example 5:
Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
Output: yellow yellow red blue green
Pattern: zup -> yellow, bluf -> yellow, wif -> red, lug -> blue, dax -> green

Looking at these examples:

- In examples 1 and 3, ""bluf"" is directly after ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red."" Considering just these examples would make us think that ""bluf"" also outputs red.
- In example 2, ""bluf"" is between ""zup"" and ""wif,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow red,"" which suggests ""bluf"" outputs yellow.
- In example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" with no intervening words, and outputs ""red,"" which fits with the first observation that ""bluf"" might output ""red.""
- In example 5, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" with no intervening words, and outputs ""yellow,"" which fits with the second observation that ""bluf"" might output ""yellow.""

The pattern seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word directly before it.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color output of the immediate preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color that is the output related to the word immediately preceding it. Therefore:

- ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow"", so ""walm"" after ""zup"" means repeat yellow.
- ""wif walm dax"" produces ""red red red green"", so ""walm"" after ""wif"" means repeat red.
- ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" produces ""green green green red blue green green green"", so ""walm"" after ""dax"" means repeat green, etc.
- ""lug walm zup"" produces ""blue blue blue yellow"", so ""walm"" after ""lug"" means repeat blue.
- ""lug walm zup walm"" produces ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow"", showing consistency with the above rules.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color output associated with the word immediately before ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,46
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, lug consistently translates to 'blue'. Each time the word 'lug' appears in the input, the word 'blue' appears an equivalent number of times in the output.

Rule: lug -> 'blue'
Based on the given examples, the following pattern can be observed:

1. dax zup lug wif lug -> green yellow blue red blue
2. dax lug -> green blue
3. zup dax zup lug -> yellow green yellow blue
4. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
5. dax walm zup lug walm -> green green green yellow blue blue blue

It seems that ""dax"" by itself corresponds to the color green. However, when looking at the fourth and fifth examples where ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"", we observe the color green is repeated multiple times in the output.

Based on this observation, the rule for ""dax"" appears to be as follows:

Rule: ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" and if ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"", it causes the next color word to repeat until a different word is encountered. 

Hence, the rule for the meaning of dax would be:

dax -> always translates to ""green""; causes the following color to repeat if ""walm"" is encountered right after dax.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following rule for the nonce word ""wif"":

Every instance of ""wif"" is followed by the output ""red"".

Now, let's break down the examples to understand the structure of the input to output transformation:

- wif -> red
  This example establishes that ""wif"" on its own translates to ""red"".

- wif lug -> red blue
  This suggests that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".

- wif zup -> red yellow
  Similarly, this suggests that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".

- wif walm zup -> red red red yellow
  Given that ""wif"" is consistent with generating ""red"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", it seems reasonable to deduce that ""walm"" translates to ""red"". This implies that the repetition of ""red"" is dependent on the number of times ""wif"" and ""walm"" appear. Hence, ""wif"" translates to ""red"", and ""walm"" repeats the last color mentioned, which in the context of these examples, is also ""red"".

Thus, the rule that emerges for ""wif"" could be expressed as follows:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red"". Each subsequent word may have a corresponding color translation, with ""wif"" being a constant that always maps to ""red"", and ""walm"" acting as a repeater for the last color mentioned.
Based on the provided examples where each instance of ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the word ""yellow,"" the rule can be determined as follows:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it doubles the color output of the word that comes before it. Here's the breakdown:

- In ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red and ""bluf"" repeats that color, resulting in ""red red.""
- In ""dax bluf wif zup lug,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""bluf"" repeats it, therefore ""green green,"" followed by the respective colors for ""wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug.""
- For the other examples, the pattern holds true as ""bluf"" continues to repeat the color associated with the word before it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color associated with the preceding word.
Based on the provided examples, it is apparent that ""walm"" corresponds to repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it. In each example, the color that is repeated occurs as many times as the presence of ""walm"".

Let's analyze each input and output to deduce the association:

- ""zup walm wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow red""
  ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"". ""Walm"" seems to cause ""yellow"" to repeat three times before moving to a new word ""wif"" which translates to ""red"".

- ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red""
  ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""walm"" again causes ""yellow"" to repeat three times. ""Lug"" translates to ""blue"", and ""wif"" is ""red"" (with ""bluf"" causing a duplicate output of ""red"").

- ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
  ""dax"" is ""green"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", and ""walm"" makes ""blue"" repeat three times in total.

- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
  ""zup"" is ""yellow"", and ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to repeat for a total of three times.

- ""wif dax lug walm"" -> ""red green blue blue blue""
  ""wif"" is ""red"", ""dax"" is ""green"", and ""lug"" is ""blue"". Here ""walm"" causes the color ""blue"" to be repeated a total of three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to correspond to repeating the color of the word that comes directly before it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow blue,yellow yellow yellow blue,True,47
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To determine the meaning of ""lug,"" we can analyze the instances of ""lug"" in the provided examples and look for patterns:

Example 1: zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> yellow blue red green green red
Example 2: zup wif dax walm lug -> yellow red green green green blue
Example 3: wif lug dax walm -> red blue green green green
Example 4: lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue
Example 5: wif bluf lug dax wif -> red red blue green red

From the given examples, it can be observed that the output related to the word ""lug"" seems consistent:

- In Example 1, ""lug"" is followed by ""wif"" and maps to ""blue red"".
- In Example 2, ""lug"" is the last word and maps to ""blue"".
- In Example 3, ""lug"" is followed by ""dax"" and maps to ""blue green"".
- In Example 4, ""lug"" appears twice, first mapping to ""blue"" and then to ""blue blue"" when immediately followed by another instance of ""lug"".
- In Example 5, ""lug"" is followed by ""dax"" and maps to ""blue green"".

From this analysis, ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue,"" with varying subsequent colors likely determined by the next word.

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of the word ""dax,"" let's analyze its placement and corresponding output in each example:

1. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
   Output: green red green yellow yellow
   
    - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" when placed before ""wif"" and also when followed by ""zup.""
   
2. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   
    - The first ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and is followed by ""walm,"" which outputs ""green.""
    - The second ""dax"" also corresponds to ""green"" and precedes ""walm,"" which again corresponds to ""green."" 
    - Hence, ""dax"" seems to be linked to ""green"" regardless of its position with respect to ""walm.""

3. Input: dax zup
   Output: green yellow
   
    - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" when followed by ""zup.""

4. Input: zup bluf dax
   Output: yellow yellow green
   
    - ""dax"" at the end of the sequence corresponds to ""green.""

5. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green
   
    - Once again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" at the end of the sequence.

From these observations, we can conclude that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green,"" regardless of its position or the words that come before or after it.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in these examples.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. In each case, the color that is outputted right after ""bluf"" is the same as the color that corresponds to the word before ""bluf."" Here's the breakdown:

1. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"" : The word before bluf, wif, corresponds to red. After bluf is used, red is repeated.
2. ""dax bluf wif lug"" -> ""green green red blue"" : The word before bluf, dax, corresponds to green. Right after bluf, green is repeated.
3. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"" : The word before bluf, dax, corresponds to green, and is repeated after bluf.
4. ""wif zup dax bluf"" -> ""red yellow green green"" : The word before bluf, dax, corresponds to green, which is repeated after bluf.
5. ""zup dax bluf"" -> ""yellow green green"" : The word before bluf, dax, corresponds to green, which is repeated after bluf.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the word before it.
Analyzing the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" may be associated with the color to its immediate left being repeated for the output until a different color or the end of the input.

- In the first example, ""lug walm wif lug"" results in ""blue blue blue red blue."" ""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and the output is ""blue"" repeated until ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" gives us ""yellow yellow red red red."" This time, ""walm"" is at the end, and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the input, so in the output, ""red"" is repeated after ""wif.""
- In the third example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and since ""walm"" follows it with no color after, ""yellow"" is repeated for the output.
- In the fourth example, ""wif dax zup walm"" results in ""red green yellow yellow yellow."" Again, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the output is ""yellow"" repeated.
- The last example, ""dax walm zup,"" gives ""green green green yellow."" ""Walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" The output is ""green"" repeated until a new color (""zup"" -> ""yellow"") appears.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color that precedes ""walm"" until a different color word appears in the input or the input ends.

Based on this analysis, ""walm"" serves as a command to repeat the previous color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
Observing the examples provided, let's try to infer the rule for ""dax"":

1. When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm wif walm,"" the output is ""green green green red red red."" This could suggest that ""walm"" corresponds to the color green but when repeated (after an intervention of ""wif""), it changes to red.

2. When ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green."" This suggests that ""bluf"" might correspond to the color green and ""dax"" may cause duplication or repetition of the color associated with the following word.

3. When ""dax"" is followed by ""zup,"" the output is ""green yellow."" This might indicate that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, but the presence of ""dax"" still introduces a green before the color corresponding to the word that follows it.

4. When ""lug wif lug"" comes before ""dax bluf,"" the output is ""blue red blue green green."" This adheres to the previous indication that ""lug wif lug"" results in ""blue red blue"" and that ""dax"" preceding ""bluf"" means a green followed by another green.

5. When ""lug wif dax"" occurs, the output is ""blue red green."" It follows the pattern that ""lug wif"" means ""blue red"" and ""dax"" introduces a green.

Considering all the examples, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: ""Dax"" seems to signify that the color green should be outputted first, followed by the color associated with the word that comes after ""dax."" If the word after ""dax"" is repeated or followed by another specific word (e.g., ""wif""), there might be further rules that apply to the sequence.

Given the above, we can sum up the rule for ""dax"" as:

dax -> introduces a green before the color associated with the following word.
To find the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to identify a consistent pattern across the examples provided.

From the given examples we can see:
- ""wif"" alone translates to ""red""
- When other words are present, ""wif"" still translates to ""red""

To make a rule for ""wif,"" we'll look at other words:
- ""dax"" appears to translate to ""green"" (second and third inputs)
- ""walm"" appears at the end of a sequence, followed by three ""red"" which could suggest that ""walm"" is related to repeating the word before it.
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" based on the fourth input.
- ""bluf"" does not have a clear translation but based on the last input, it might mean ""blue.""
- ""zup"" seems to translate to ""yellow"" when looking at the third and last inputs.

From these observations, it is evident that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of its position or the context within the sequence. Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" is as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the following rule can be deduced:

zup -> yellow

Each instance of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" may signify the color red when it follows the word ""wif,"" and blue in other circumstances. We can infer this rule by examining the sequences and the corresponding output colors:

- Whenever we see ""wif bluf"" it translates to ""red red.""
- Whenever we see ""bluf"" not immediately preceded by ""wif,"" it translates to ""blue.""

This inference is made by isolating the occurrences of ""bluf"" and identifying the patterns in the outputs:

1. ""lug wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue blue"" - here ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and since ""bluf"" comes right after ""lug"" (meaning ""blue""), ""bluf"" becomes ""blue"" as well.
   
2. ""wif lug bluf wif"" translates to ""red blue blue red"" - as before, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""wif"" is ""red,"" but ""bluf"" is ""blue"" after ""lug"" and not after ""wif"".
   
3. ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green"" - ""bluf"" comes right after ""wif,"" so it is ""red"" in this instance.
   
4. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""green red yellow yellow red red red"" - where ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" after ""zup,"" showing that its translation to ""yellow"" is not consistent and likely context-dependent; however, ""wif bluf"" again translates to ""red red"".
   
5. ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"" - where ""bluf"" is directly following ""wif,"" so it is again ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> means ""blue,"" except when immediately following ""wif,"" where it means ""red"".
Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the pattern for the nonce word ""walm"" by comparing the inputs and their respective outputs.

From the examples, we observe the following:
- Whenever ""walm"" immediately follows ""dax"", the sequence ""green green green"" is produced.
- Whenever ""walm"" is preceded by any word other than ""dax"", a sequence of three colors identical to the color corresponding to the preceding word is generated.
- In the absence of a word before ""walm"", it defaults to a sequence of three reds.

Here are the observations written out:

1. dax zup dax walm -> green yellow green green green
   (The sequence starts with a green for ""dax"", yellow for ""zup"", then repeats green for ""dax"", and ""walm"" produces three more greens.)

2. lug dax walm -> blue green green green
   (""lug"" leads to blue, ""dax"" to green, and ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and produces three more greens.)

3. lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow
   (""lug"" to blue, ""wif"" to red, ""dax"" to green, ""walm"" after ""dax"" thus three greens, and ""zup"" to yellow.)

4. dax walm zup walm -> green green green yellow yellow yellow
   (Starts with green for ""dax"", ""walm"" then produces three greens, ""zup"" yields yellow, and ""walm"" without a different word in front repeats the ""yellow"" three times.)

5. wif walm zup -> red red red yellow
   (""wif"" transitions to red, ""walm"" with nothing but ""wif"" in front repeats the red three times, then ""zup"" gives a yellow.)

From these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:
- If ""walm"" follows ""dax"", then output three green colors.
- If ""walm"" follows any other word, output three instances of the color that corresponds to the preceding word.
- In the absence of a specific rule about what comes before ""walm"", it defaults to a sequence of three reds.

Therefore:

walm -> A sequence of three colors. The color depends on the preceding word: if preceded by ""dax,"" the sequence is green; otherwise, it repeats the color associated with the preceding word (defaulting to red if no color-coding is established).

Rule: If ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" output green green green; if any other word precedes ""walm,"" repeat the corresponding color of the preceding word three times; if alone or no context is provided, assume red red red.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Given the consistency across the examples, the rule seems to be as follows:

Rule: dax -> green

This means that whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red'. When 'wif' appears before other nonce words, those words correspond to specific colors as well. Here's the list of associations:

- 'wif' -> 'red'
- 'zup' -> 'yellow'
- 'dax' -> 'green'
- 'bluf' -> 'yellow'
- 'lug' -> 'blue'

So, the rule we can gather is:

Rule: 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red', irrespective of its position in the sequence. The word immediately following 'wif' indicates another color in the output sequence.

Therefore, the meaning is:

wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Rule: bluf -> red when following ""wif"", blue when following ""lug"", and yellow when following ""zup"".
walm -> meaning. The word ""walm"" seems to imply the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows another word (e.g., lug, wif, dax), the color associated with that preceding word is repeated for as many times as the term ""walm"" is used. For instance:

- In ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug,"" ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""wif"" is associated with the color red, so ""walm"" results in repeating the color red.
- In ""lug walm dax,"" ""lug"" is associated with blue, and ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" hence ""walm"" means repeating blue.
- In ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" is associated with green, and ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" so ""walm"" implies repeating green.
- In ""wif lug walm,"" ""lug"" is the word before ""walm,"" which means blue, so ""walm"" indicates repeating blue.
- In ""wif walm dax zup,"" ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" indicating that red should be repeated.

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each provided example.
Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following about the nonce word ""dax"":

- In the first example, ""dax"" translates to ""green"".
- In the second example, ""dax"" is once again translated to ""green"", and it precedes ""zup"" which translates to ""yellow"". The positions of ""wif"", ""lug"", and ""bluf"" also correlate directly with ""red"", ""blue"", and ""blue"", respectively.
- The third example reiterates the consistency of ""dax"" representing ""green"". We see that ""wif"" is consistently ""red"" and that the placement of ""walm"" is correlated with ""blue"".
- The fourth example confirms that ""dax"" is ""green"", with the same pattern seen for ""walm"" (green), ""wif"" (red), and ""zup"" (yellow) as per the previous examples.
- Lastly, in the fifth example, we again see ""dax"" translating to ""green"". ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" but precedes ""wif"", indicating that its meaning changes or that it adjusts based on context. Given the previous examples, it could be that ""walm"" is green if it follows ""dax"" and blue if it follows ""wif"" or ""lug"". ""Zup"" remains consistent in translating to ""yellow"".

From the evidence collected, the following rule can be stated:

Rule: dax -> green

This rule applies regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the sequence, indicating a stable translation of the nonce word to the color ""green"".
Based on the examples provided where the input is a sequence of words and the output is a sequence of colors, it appears that each word is translated directly to a specific color. The word ""wif"" appears in each input and is consistently translated to ""red."" 

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to lead to the repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. Here is how the rule applies in each case:

Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red (The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" causes it to repeat.)
Input: lug bluf zup lug -> Output: blue blue yellow blue (The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" makes ""blue"" repeat once before moving on to the next words.)
Input: dax bluf zup -> Output: green green yellow (The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" makes ""green"" repeat once before moving on to the next word, ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."")
Input: dax bluf wif zup wif -> Output: green green red yellow red (The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" causes it to repeat, followed by ""wif"" for ""red,"" then ""zup"" for ""yellow,"" and finally ""wif"" again for ""red."")
Input: wif bluf dax -> Output: red red green (The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" makes ""red"" repeat once before moving on to the word ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."")

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's first list the outputs following each instance of ""walm"" in the inputs:

1. zup walm dax -> yellow yellow yellow green
2. lug walm -> blue blue blue
3. wif walm dax -> red red red green
4. dax walm zup -> green green green yellow
5. dax walm -> green green green

Looking at these examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the next color to be repeated three times regardless of what the color is, followed by the original color associated with the next word.

Let's break this down further:

- In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" which normally produces green. The output after ""walm"" is three yellows (associated with ""zup"" preceding ""walm"") followed by green.
- In the second example, ""lug"" normally translates to blue, and after ""walm,"" it's indeed blue repeated three times.
- In the third instance, ""dax"" after ""walm"" should be green. Before ""walm,"" ""wif"" is red, so the output is three reds followed by the green associated with ""dax.""
- In the fourth instance, ""zup"" generally means yellow, and ""walm"" is followed by ""zup."" The output is three instances of green (from ""dax"" before ""walm"") followed by yellow.
- In the fifth instance, ""dax"" both precedes and follows ""walm,"" which means it should be green, and this is reflected in the output as three greens, and there is no color change because ""dax"" comes after ""walm.""

Based on this pattern, ""walm"" seems to cause the output color associated with the word before it to repeat three times, followed by the color that would normally be associated with the word after it.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times, followed by the color associated with the following word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax walm lug bluf dax wif
    ",Output: yellow green green green green blue blue green red,yellow green green green blue blue green red,False,51
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

In every example, the presence of the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

- In the first input ""dax lug zup dax"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"".
- In the second input ""lug walm zup"", the first word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""zup"" at the end corresponds to ""yellow"". Since ""walm"" is not present in any other example, we can deduce that its occurrence between two ""lug""s doesn’t change the color output for ""lug"", keeping it as ""blue"".
- In the third input, ""zup lug,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" follows as ""blue"".
- The fourth example ""dax wif lug"" yields ""green red blue,"" showing ""dax"" as ""green,"" ""wif"" as ""red,"" and ""lug"" again as ""blue"".
- The final example solidifies the case with a repeated ""dax lug dax lug wif"" sequence corresponding to ""green blue green blue red"", making it clear that ""lug"" consistently means ""blue"".
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"". Each instance of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position or the context within the sequence of words.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
Based on the given examples, the following associations between input words and output colors can be observed:

- Whenever the word ""zup"" appears, the corresponding output is ""yellow"".
- Whenever the word ""wif"" appears, the corresponding output is ""red"".
- Whenever the word ""bluf"" appears, the corresponding output is ""red"".
- Whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the corresponding output is ""green"".
- Whenever the word ""lug"" appears, the corresponding output is ""blue"".

Therefore, we can deduce that the nonce word ""zup"" is systematically associated with the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other words.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> repeated color word. The repeated color word corresponds to the color word that comes before the nonce word ""bluf"".

Rule:
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", the output is ""blue blue"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output is ""red red"".
- When ""bluf"" precedes ""wif"", it doesn't affect the repetition of the color word for ""wif"", suggesting that the rule is position-dependent.
- There is no example where ""bluf"" is used without a color word before it, so it's not possible to deduce what ""bluf"" would mean on its own.

Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to indicate that the color word before it should be repeated once in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's first look at the patterns between the input and the output.

In the first input, ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" leads to ""blue blue blue green red blue red."" The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" Since ""dax"" is followed by ""green,"" we can infer that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" The word ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" and before ""dax"" and the output is ""blue blue blue,"" showing that the presence of ""walm"" introduces two additional ""blue"" before the next color that corresponds to the following word.

In the second input, ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" The word ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" ""Walm"" appears after ""lug,"" and we see two additional ""blue"" in the output.

In the third example, ""dax walm wif walm zup"" turns into ""green green green red red red yellow."" We can see that ""walm"" follows ""dax"" for three ""green"" and follows ""wif"" for three ""red."" ""Zup"" has not appeared in previous examples, but its output is ""yellow,"" so we can infer that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

In the fourth example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" hence ""walm"" after ""dax"" gives two additional ""green.""

The fifth example, ""wif lug dax walm,"" changes to ""red blue green green green."" The pattern here also follows, with ""dax"" being ""green"" and ""walm"" adding two more ""green.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the output to be three consecutive instances of the color associated with the word that follows ""walm."" If there is no word following ""walm,"" the last mentioned color is repeated three times. Therefore:

walm -> Triplicates the next color in the sequence (or the last mentioned color if none follows). Rule.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm wif walm dax lug dax
    ",Output: green green green red red red green blue green,green green green red red red green blue green,True,52
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever you see ""lug,"" you should translate it to ""blue.""
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the examples provided in pairs.

1. lug dax lug -> blue green blue
2. dax wif -> green red
3. dax wif dax zup bluf -> green red green yellow yellow
4. wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
5. dax walm -> green green green

From example 1, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and since it's around ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" ""dax"" in this instance translates to the word ""green.""

In example 2, the only word beside ""dax"" is ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" maintaining the consistency of ""dax"" being ""green.""

The pattern of ""dax"" being ""green"" holds up in example 3 as well, as it alternates with the word ""wif,"" which has been established to mean ""red."" The remaining words, ""zup"" and ""bluf,"" correspond to ""yellow.""

Example 4 is more complex but adheres to the established pattern; ""lug"" is still ""blue,"" and the appearance of ""dax"" nearer to the end follows a pattern of repetition. ""Walm"" seems to be a repeating sequence of ""green,"" with the number of repetitions equalling the positions away from ""dax"" it is. When ""lug"" comes right after ""dax,"" which means ""green,"" the sequence is ""green blue blue,"" indicating that ""dax"" could relate to repeating the next word's corresponding color once before it.

Example 5 strengthens the idea that ""walm"" indeed means a sequence of ""green,"" which would match the earlier idea of repeating the subsequent word. But since ""dax"" comes before ""walm,"" we might expect ""dax"" to be simply ""green"" as it leads the sequence.

With these analyses, there's no evidence to contradict the simplicity of ""dax"" meaning ""green."" It does not seem to change based on position or context in the provided examples. Thus, we can induce the rule:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. Each example where ""wif"" appears, the output includes the word ""red.""

Here is the correlation between the inputs and outputs:

- ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow,"" as seen in the first example.
- ""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green,"" based on multiple examples.
- ""bluf"" seems to correspond to ""red,"" as seen in the first example, but this might be an error as it's only a single instance. The occurrence of ""bluf"" immediately following ""wif dax wif"" might have caused a repeat of the word ""red"" instead of representing a new color.
- ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue,"" based on multiple examples.

Using these correlations, the rule for ""wif"" is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples where the nonce word ""zup"" is used, we can attempt to deduce its meaning by looking at the patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs. 

- In the first example, each ""wif"" precedes a ""red,"" each ""lug"" precedes a ""blue,"" and each ""walm"" precedes a ""blue,"" but after ""zup,"" the color sequence is ""yellow red blue.""
- In the second example, ""zup lug"" results in ""yellow blue,"" which suggests that ""zup"" is directly followed by ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""zup wif lug zup walm"" results in ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow,"" so again after ""zup,"" the color ""yellow"" follows, and the rest of the inputs seem to modify the expected output sequence.
- In the fourth example, ""zup dax"" results in ""yellow green,"" so once more ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, we don’t have a ""yellow"" directly following ""zup,"" but instead a sequence of ""red red red yellow,"" which may imply that ""zup"" can affect multiple consecutive items in the sequence.

Putting these observations together, it seems clear that ""zup"" has the effect of changing the color sequence that follows. Whenever ""zup"" is included in the input, the following items are ""yellow"" instead of their regular colors, until a new regular color appears.

The rule for ""zup"" might also be that it serves as a reset or override for the color that directly follows it, turning that color into ""yellow."" However, since in some cases the ""yellow"" color persists beyond just the next item in the sequence, it appears that ""zup"" can sometimes change a sequence of colors to ""yellow,"" potentially until the sequence is broken by a different color or sequence effect. Therefore, the exact change in pattern regarding length and condition after ""zup"" is unclear and might need more examples to fully understand.

Given this information, we can preliminarily define ""zup"" with the following rule:

Rule: ""zup"" changes the expected color output to ""yellow"" for at least the item that follows it, and potentially for a sequence that follows until another color or reset condition appears. 

zup -> meaning. Rule: Resets the color sequence to ""yellow.""
From the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates into a color that corresponds to the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here's the reasoning:

- ""wif bluf zup"" -> ""red red yellow"": ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and translates to ""red"", the same color as ""wif"".
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"": Again, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and translates to ""red"".
- ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"": ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and translates to ""blue"".
- ""dax bluf lug wif"" -> ""green green blue red"": ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and translates to ""green"".
- ""lug bluf zup"" -> ""blue blue yellow"": ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and translates to ""blue"".

Rule: bluf -> the color corresponding to the color named by the word immediately preceding it.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns between inputs and outputs, paying attention to the repetition and positioning of colors in the output that correspond to instances of ""walm.""

Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow
- ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and before ""zup,"" resulting in two additional blues followed by a yellow.

Input: lug walm zup walm
Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
- A repetition of the previous pattern with an additional occurrence of ""walm"" leading to a repetition of the resulting colors.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""lug,"" converting to three blues after a green.

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
- After ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" and ""dax,"" ""walm"" translates to three greens.

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue
- ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" and ""wif,"" resulting in red repeated three times, followed by a blue after a ""lug.""

Given these patterns, it seems that ""walm"" becomes a sequence of three colors that follow a certain rule. It appears that ""walm"" might derive its color sequence from the color immediately preceding it, repeating that color three times. However, in the case where ""lug"" follows ""walm,"" a blue follows the repetition. The following rule can be derived:

Rule:
- When ""walm"" is preceded by another word, the color associated with that word is repeated three times.
- If ""lug"" follows ""walm,"" an additional blue is appended to the output after the three repeated colors.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be about repeating the color associated with the word that comes just before it, generally three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax lug
    ",Output: blue green blue,blue green blue,True,53
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue,"" regardless of the context or position in the sequence. The word ""lug"" is always followed or preceded by another color in the output, suggesting that ""lug"" itself stands independently as the color blue.

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the examples provided, we can infer that each word corresponds to a color. Let's analyze the color output produced by each word:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" (as seen in examples 4 and 5).

The word ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence. Thus, we can conclude that:

dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each nonce word corresponds to a color. Here are the apparent associations:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- wif -> red

The position of ""wif"" in the sentence doesn't appear to affect its meaning; it consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of where it occurs in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" when preceded by ""wif,"" to the color ""blue"" when preceded by ""lug,"" and to the color ""yellow"" when followed by ""zup."" If ""bluf"" is followed by ""walm,"" it results in a repetition of the previous color twice followed by ""red."" If it is preceded by ""dax,"" it leads to the color ""green."" 

So, ""bluf"" changes its meaning based on the context, specifically the word that immediately precedes or follows it.
Using the provided examples, we can attempt to discern the meaning of ""walm"" by examining its use and the corresponding output colors. 

1. In example 1, ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue."" Since ""wif"" seems to correlate to red and ""lug"" seems to correlate to blue, one could hypothesize that ""walm"" might mean repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it.

2. In example 2, ""zup wif dax walm"" translates to ""yellow red green green green."" Again, ""walm"" appears to cause the repetition of the color before it which, in this case, is green (associated with ""dax"").

3. In example 3, ""lug wif walm"" translates to ""blue red red red."" This reinforces the hypothesis that ""walm"" causes the color of the word before it to repeat.

4. In example 4, ""lug walm zup walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""walm"" seems to cause the color of ""lug"" (blue) and ""zup"" (yellow) to repeat three times each.

5. In example 5, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red."" Here, ""walm"" again has caused ""wif"" (red) to repeat three times.

From these observations, the rule seems consistent: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word that directly precedes it to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Each occurrence of ""lug"" in the input is translated to ""blue"" in the output. 

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, each instance of a nonce word corresponds to a specific color:

- zup corresponds to yellow
- lug corresponds to blue
- walm, when repeated, corresponds to green
- wif corresponds to red
- dax corresponds to green

When ""dax"" appears in the sequence, regardless of position or surrounding words, the output is always ""green"". This leads to the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: Each distinct word translates to a specific color, and ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence of words.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Each instance of ""zup"" in the input is translated to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position or the context in which it appears.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf"" let's inspect the input-output pairs given. Each input seems to contain a nonce word (dax, lug, wif, zup) followed by ""bluf,"" and the output contains one or two color words.

Here is a breakdown of the outputs associated with the given inputs:

- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
- ""lug wif bluf"" -> ""blue red red""
- ""zup bluf"" (twice) -> ""yellow yellow""
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""

Notice that:

- When ""bluf"" is paired with ""dax,"" the output is ""green green."" This suggests that ""dax"" might translate to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" causes the color word to be repeated.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug wif,"" the output is ""blue red red,"" with ""red"" being repeated. This fits the earlier notion that ""bluf"" causes the repeat, as ""wif"" seems to translate to ""red.""
- ""zup bluf"" consistently translates to ""yellow yellow,"" indicating ""zup"" means ""yellow"" and, as before, ""bluf"" causes the color word to repeat.
- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red,"" further supporting the repetition pattern associated with ""bluf.""

Thus, the most consistent rule that we can deduce is:

Rule: bluf -> causes the color word that Precedes ""bluf"" to be repeated.
Based on the provided examples, walm seems to mirror the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Here's the breakdown:

In the first example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green,"" which implies that walm takes on the color of ""dax,"" which is green.

In the second example, ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" We see that walm takes the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.

In the third example, ""lug walm wif zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue red yellow red."" Here walm takes the color of ""lug,"" which is blue.

In the fourth example, ""zup walm wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow red."" Walm takes the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.

In the fifth example, ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" Walm takes on the color of ""lug,"" which is blue.

Rule:
walm -> takes the color of the word immediately before it. If ""x"" is a color word preceding ""walm,"" then ""walm"" translates to the color represented by ""x.""

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" 

Here is the detailed analysis for each line:

- In the first example, every occurrence of ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" appears before and after ""wif"" and both times it is translated to ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""lug"" alone translates to ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" appears multiple times, and each instance corresponds to ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue.
Rule: dax -> green

Each instance of ""dax"" in the inputs corresponds to ""green"" in the outputs, regardless of the other words present.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
From the provided examples, we can deduce that ""zup"" represents a transition point where the sequence starts repeating colors from the beginning. Each word corresponds to a color, with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red"", ""walm"" corresponding to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"". The repetition happens with the same number of colors as initially presented before the word ""zup"".

Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""wif walm zup walm"", we see ""red yellow"" before zup and the repetition of ""red yellow yellow"" after zup, which indicates that the pattern before zup (red, yellow) should be repeated with the next word(s) (walm), and since walm corresponds to yellow, it is repeated twice to finish the pattern.
- In the second example, ""lug zup wif zup"", it follows the same pattern with ""blue"" being before the first zup, then ""red"" before the second zup, with the pattern repeating ""yellow"" after each zup.
- In the third example, ""wif zup"", we have ""red"" before zup and then ""yellow"" after zup, following the same logic.
- In the fourth example, ""zup wif walm"", ""yellow"" comes first, followed by the pattern ""red yellow yellow"", indicating that the color sequence starts with the first color following ""zup"".
- In the fifth example, ""lug walm zup walm"", the pattern ""blue blue blue"" before zup is followed by ""yellow yellow yellow"" after zup, repeating the color of ""walm"".

Therefore, the rule is that zup indicates a point where the sequence of colors should start repeating from the previous color pattern established before ""zup.""

Rule: zup -> indicates the repetition of the color sequence pattern established before it.
Rule: bluf -> the color represented by the preceding word. 

In the examples given, ""bluf"" follows a color word and the output is that color word repeated. For instance, when ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue,"" implying that ""bluf"" means the preceding color should be repeated.
Using the given examples, I can infer that ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color that immediately follows it three times. To confirm this, let's look at the contexts in which ""walm"" appears:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" is blue, and ""walm"" causes the color blue to repeat three times.
- In the second example, ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" translates to ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow."" In this case, ""wif"" is red, and ""zup"" is yellow. The first occurrence of ""walm"" is after ""wif,"" and thus, ""red"" is repeated three times. The second occurrence of ""walm"" is also after ""wif,"" and again, ""red"" is repeated three times.
- In the third example, ""dax wif walm"" translates to ""green red red red."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), and thus ""red"" is repeated three times.
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm wif lug"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue."" Again, ""walm"" is after ""lug"" (blue), resulting in ""blue"" being repeated three times, and it is not affecting the subsequent color ""red"" which is associated with ""wif.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" results in ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" ""Walm"" follows the sequence ""zup lug zup,"" but only the immediate preceding color, which is ""yellow"" associated with ""zup,"" is repeated three times due to ""walm."" It does not cause ""blue"" to be repeated three times even though ""lug"" precedes ""zup.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be described as:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color word that immediately precedes it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples given, every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Therefore, ""dax"" means ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" The rule seems consistent across all examples. Whenever the word ""wif"" appears, ""red"" is a part of the output:

- In the first example, ""wif"" is the only input, and the output is ""red.""
- In the second and fourth examples, ""zup wif"" both result in ""yellow red,"" so ""wif"" is consistently represented by ""red.""
- In the third example, ""dax wif zup"" outputs ""green red yellow,"" so ""wif"" again aligns with ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" outputs ""yellow blue red green green red,"" and both instances of ""wif"" correspond to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" However, there seems to be an additional rule or pattern that dictates that the output color repeats corresponding to the number of times a word appears in a sequence.

Let's analyze the examples to understand this:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" appears once and the color ""green"" is output once. ""Zup"" appears once and ""yellow"" is output once.

2. In the second example, there are no repeats in the input, and the word ""zup"" appears once, followed by ""bluf"" once. The output is two yellows, which indicates that ""zup"" could mean ""yellow,"" and the repetition rule applies since ""zup"" and the following word ""bluf"" appear side by side.

3. The third example has ""dax"" once, followed by ""zup"" once, and other words each appearing once. The output is ""green yellow red red blue,"" following the rule that when ""zup"" is present, the output color yellow is repeated for the following word, which would be ""wif"" and translated to ""red.""

4. In the fourth example, the sequence ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" results in the color pattern ""blue green green yellow blue red,"" again showing the repetition of the color corresponding to ""zup"" for the following word ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

5. In the fifth example, ""zup"" appears once at the beginning, followed by ""walm"" and ""lug,"" which are repeated terms, so ""yellow"" is output three times.

Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow,"" and when ""zup"" is present, the output color yellow is repeated for the following word as well (considering the following word as a color term being translated).

zup -> yellow (with repetition effect on the following color term).
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's first identify the patterns associated with the other words and their corresponding colors:

- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" but it's also associated with ""yellow"" when paired with ""zup."" Since ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" gives us ""green yellow blue yellow yellow,"" we see that ""lug"" only corresponds to ""blue"" when it follows ""dax.""

Now, observing the outputs associated with ""bluf,"" we have:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf dax lug"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow green blue."" Since we know that ""zup"" is yellow, ""dax"" is green, and ""lug"" after ""dax"" is blue, it follows that ""bluf"" after ""zup"" must also be yellow.
- In the second example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red."" Since there's no other word for comparison, we can hypothesize that ""bluf"" matches the color of the preceding word, which here is ""wif"" and is red.
- In all other examples, ""bluf"" is preceded by a word and the output color for ""bluf"" matches the color of the word that comes before it.

Given these observations, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be associated with a repeated color. Each instance of ""walm"" is followed by the same color word repeated three times. The color repetition corresponds to the word that precedes ""walm."" Specifically:

- ""zup walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""lug walm"" yields ""blue blue blue"" (noted twice)
- ""lug walm wif lug"" follows the established pattern with ""walm"" yielding ""blue blue blue"", but there is an additional color ""red"" before the final ""blue"", which corresponds to ""lug.""
- ""dax walm zup lug walm"" includes ""walm"" twice, first yielding ""green green green"" after ""dax"" and then ""blue blue blue"" after ""lug"" with an additional ""yellow"" corresponding to ""zup"" inserted in between.

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" prompts the output of three consecutive occurrences of the color represented by the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax bluf wif
    ",Output: green green red,green green red,True,57
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Every time ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" is used in the output.
Given the examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently correlates with a specific color in the output. The color is always ""green"" whenever ""dax"" is present in the input. Thus, irrespective of the position of the word ""dax"" within the input sequence, the output color associated with it is green. The other words in the sequence correlate with other colors (lug -> blue, walm -> blue, zup -> yellow, wif -> red).

Therefore, the rule can be defined as follows:

dax -> green. Rule: Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""green"".
Based on the given examples, we observe the following associations:

- ""wif"" on its own corresponds to the output ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is paired with another word, the output is multiple ""red"" corresponding to the number of words following ""wif,"" plus a ""red"" for ""wif"" itself. For example, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red.""
- When other words are present without ""wif,"" they have their own corresponding colors (e.g., ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"").
- When ""wif"" is present with a sequence of words, including other nonce words, it seems that ""wif"" repeats the color ""red"" for itself plus every word that follows it until another color word is encountered.

From this, we can induce that the rule for ""wif"" is that it generates a ""red"" for itself and each subsequent word following it until a new color-coded word appears.

Rule: wif -> Generates a ""red"" for itself and for each word following it until a new color word is encountered.
zup -> yellow. Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it translates to ""yellow"" in the output.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look for a pattern that is consistent in each instance the word occurs. In each example, ""bluf"" is present and we see the word ""red"" appear twice immediately following the sequence containing ""bluf.""

Here are the occurrences of ""bluf"" and the corresponding output:

1. Input: ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" → Output: ""yellow red red yellow blue""
2. Input: ""lug walm wif bluf"" → Output: ""blue blue blue red red""
3. Input: ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" → Output: ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red""
4. Input: ""wif dax zup bluf"" → Output: ""red green yellow yellow""
5. Input: ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" → Output: ""green red yellow yellow red red red""

When “bluf” is mentioned in the input:
- In example 1, it follows ""wif"" and precedes ""zup.""
- In example 2, it follows ""wif.""
- In example 3, it again follows ""wif.""
- In example 4, it follows ""zup.""
- In example 5, it follows ""zup"" and is followed by ""wif.""

The constants before and after ""bluf"" seem to not influence its output. The outputs always seem to include a double ""red"" following the items listed before ""bluf."" None of the other inputs, when occurring without ""bluf,"" result in the ""red red"" pattern in the output. It seems that ""bluf"" directly results in ""red red"" in the output sequence, indicating its meaning could be related to a pair of reds.

Based on this pattern, we can infer:

bluf -> meaning. Rule:
""bluf"" represents two consecutive ""red"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. The number of repetitions is equal to the number of letters in the word that precedes ""walm."" Here is how the rule applies to each example:

- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" is associated with the color blue and has three letters.
- ""lug dax walm"" outputs ""blue green green green"" because ""dax"" is associated with the color green and has four letters.
- ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" outputs ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"" because ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow and has three letters, with ""lug"" following ""walm,"" which is blue.
- ""zup wif walm lug"" outputs ""yellow red red red blue"" because ""wif"" is associated with the color red and has three letters.
- ""wif walm zup"" outputs ""red red red yellow"" because ""wif"" is associated with the color red and has three letters.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word the number of times equal to the number of letters in the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Rule: lug translates to ""blue.""
Based on the examples provided:

Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow

Input: lug dax lug
Output: blue green blue

Input: dax
Output: green

Input: dax lug zup
Output: green blue yellow

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the input and output examples provided, it seems that individual nonce words correspond to specific colors. Here are the apparent mappings from word to color:

- wif -> red
- bluf -> green
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the input contains the word ""zup,"" the corresponding output is ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided, we can observe that whenever the word ""bluf"" appears in any input, it causes the corresponding output to repeat the color of the word that appears immediately before ""bluf"" in the input sequence. For example, when ""dax bluf"" is the input, the output is ""green green,"" where ""green"" corresponds to the color associated with ""dax,"" and it is repeated after ""bluf.""

Here are the observations leading to the rule:

1. ""dax bluf zup"" -> ""green green yellow"" (The color for ""dax"" is 'green' and is repeated after ""bluf."")
2. ""dax lug bluf wif"" -> ""green blue blue red"" (""lug"" is associated with 'blue,' which is repeated after ""bluf."")
3. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"" (""wif"" is associated with 'red,' and 'red' follows ""bluf."")
4. ""wif bluf lug zup"" -> ""red red blue yellow"" (""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which is associated with 'red,' hence 'red' is repeated.)
5. ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue"" (""lug"" is associated with 'blue,' and 'blue' follows ""bluf."")

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""bluf.""

Rule: If ""x"" is the word before ""bluf,"" and ""x"" corresponds to a certain color, then the output for ""bluf"" will be the color corresponding to ""x.""
Based on the examples provided, we can infer that the nonce word ""walm"" influences the output in the following way:

1. With each occurrence of ""wif"" and ""dax"":

- Input: ""wif lug dax walm"" -> Output: ""red blue green green green""
- Input: ""dax wif walm"" -> Output: ""green red red red""

After both ""wif"" and ""dax"", we notice additional ""reds"" in the output, suggesting that these inputs affect the meaning of ""walm."" However, the presence of ""lug"" seems consistent with the output of ""blue,"" regardless of ""walm.""

2. Independent of ""wif"" and ""dax"":

- Input: ""zup lug walm"" -> Output: ""yellow blue blue blue""
- Input: ""zup wif walm lug"" -> Output: ""yellow red red red blue""
- Input: ""dax lug wif walm"" -> Output: ""green blue red red red""

In these examples, after the word ""walm,"" there is a repetition of a color instead of introducing a new one, and that color is the same as the one generated just before ""walm"" (except in the case of ""lug"" which consistently stands for ""blue"").

Therefore, we can determine the rule:

Rule: ""walm"" duplicates the color word it follows (except when following ""lug"") until a new color is introduced by another input word.

Applying this rule:
- ""wif lug dax walm"" results in ""red blue green"" which is then followed by ""green green,"" because ""walm"" follows ""dax"" whose output is ""green.""
- ""dax wif walm"" results in ""green red,"" followed by ""red red red,"" because ""walm"" follows ""wif"" whose output is ""red.""

So the rule for ""walm"" seems to be the following:

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning: Repeat the most recent color (excluding any ""blue"" from ""lug""). If ""walm"" immediately follows ""lug,"" it will result in ""blue"" being repeated. If it follows any other word, that word's color output is repeated.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" Each time the word ""lug"" is present in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Therefore, the deduction is: lug -> blue. The rule is that the nonce word ""lug"" means ""blue.""
Based on the given examples, we can try to infer a pattern associating the nonce word ""dax"" with a color. Each example translates a series of words into a series of colors. Breaking down each input-output pair:

- When ""dax"" stands alone, the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" it translates to ""green green green,"" which seems to suggest that ""walm"" ensures the repetition of the color associated with ""dax.""
- In the ""zup dax walm zup wif"" input, ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green"" and ""walm"" seems to follow the rule of tripling the color associated with the word just before it (in this case, ""green"" from ""dax""). ""Zup"" shows up twice and both times it corresponds to ""yellow."" The word ""wif"" at the end turns into ""red.""
- With ""dax wif walm,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""wif"" seems to be ""red."" Following ""wif,"" ""walm"" again causes the repetition, this time of ""red.""
- In the last example, ""wif"" appears three times, corresponding with ""red"" each time. ""Dax"" remains consistently ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" without being influenced by the other words; it maintains its meaning across all examples.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"":

- In the first example, ""zup wif lug zup walm"" translates to ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow."" Noticing that ""wif"" comes before ""lug,"" which becomes ""blue,"" and ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" we can see ""wif"" results in ""red.""
- In the second example, ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" results in ""green yellow red red blue."" Here again, we see ""wif"" comes before ""bluf,"" which translates to ""red,"" and the result is also ""red.""
- In the third example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" further solidifying that ""wif"" is directly translated to ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" on its own translates to ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" translates to ""blue red green green red blue."" The usage of ""wif"" both times results in the word ""red.""

Based on the examples given and translating each occurrence of ""wif"" to ""red"" consistently:

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the outputs, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Observing the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce a pattern or rule for the nonce word ""bluf."" In each example, the sequence of inputs is associated with a sequence of colors in the output. Let's analyze the occurrences:

- In the first example, ""lug bluf zup"" leads to ""blue blue yellow."" The repeated presence of ""blue"" suggests that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""

- In the second example, ""dax zup lug bluf"" becomes ""green yellow blue blue."" Again, ""bluf"" is translated as ""blue.""

- In the third and fourth examples, ""bluf"" continues to correspond to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence (""wif dax zup bluf"" -> ""red green yellow yellow"" and ""lug zup bluf dax"" -> ""blue yellow yellow green"").

- Finally, in the fifth example, despite multiple words and repeats, ""bluf"" still corresponds to ""blue"" (""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" -> ""blue blue red blue red red red blue"").

Based on the pattern identified in all examples, it becomes apparent that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> blue.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word 'walm' causes the output to repeat the color of the last word before 'walm' for a certain number of times. Here's the analysis:

Example 1: ""wif zup walm dax zup"" translates to ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow."" The word 'walm' appears after 'zup', and 'yellow' is repeated three times before the next word 'dax' is translated to 'green'.

Example 2: ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" Here, 'walm' follows 'lug', and 'blue' is repeated three times.

Example 3: ""zup wif dax walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red green green green blue."" 'Walm' comes after 'dax', and 'green' is repeated three times before 'lug' is translated to 'blue'.

Example 4: ""zup walm dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green."" 'Walm' follows 'zup', and 'yellow' is repeated three times before 'dax' translates to 'green'.

Example 5: ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue."" 'Walm' follows 'lug', and 'blue' is repeated three times.

From these examples, we can deduce that 'walm' means to repeat the color of the last word spoken before 'walm' three times before continuing with the next translations. If there's a word after 'walm', its corresponding color is stated after the three repetitions.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word three times before proceeding with the next color translation.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue in the outputs.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

Here is how ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in each example:

- ""dax lug walm"": ""green blue blue blue""
- ""zup dax lug zup"": ""yellow green blue yellow""
- ""dax"": ""green""
- ""dax zup dax"": ""green yellow green""
- ""zup dax bluf zup dax"": ""yellow green green yellow green""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the input and output examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently correlates to the output ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. There doesn't seem to be a dependency on the surrounding words for ""wif"" to take on its meaning; ""wif"" alone or ""wif"" in a sequence with other words still results in ""red.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red

Similarly, we might deduce the meaning of other words as they seem to consistently result in the same color when they appear:

dax -> green
lug -> blue
zup -> yellow
bluf -> red

This suggests that each of these nonce words translates to a specific, consistent color in the outputs.
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be consistent regardless of the context in which ""zup"" is used. The meaning of ""zup"" seems to not depend on the words before or after it in the sequence. Every time ""zup"" is presented as an input, the output is ""yellow"". Therefore, the nonce word ""zup"" translates directly to the color ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> blue

Rule: The word bluf consistently corresponds to the color blue in the provided examples.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" influences the color output to repeat the preceding color in the Output sequence. In all examples, the color that comes right before ""walm"" gets repeated for as many times as the term ""walm"" would imply. Therefore, ""walm"" seems to act as a command for repetition of the prior color.

Here's the breakdown of the examples to illustrate the rule:

1. zup dax walm -> yellow green green green
   - ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" to ""green""
   - ""walm"" results in the repetition of ""green"" three times

2. dax wif walm lug zup -> green red red red blue yellow
   - ""dax"" correlates to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" results in the repetition of ""red"" three times

3. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" results in the repetition of ""yellow"" two more times, making it three ""yellow"" total

4. zup walm 
   - This is identical to the previous example and follows the same rule, resulting in three ""yellow""

5. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green
   - ""lug"" correlates to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green""
   - ""walm"" results in the repetition of ""blue"" two more times before ""green"" follows

Thus, the rule appears to be:
Rule: walm -> The function of ""walm"" is to repeat the color output associated with the preceding word in the sequence the number of times ""walm"" appears plus one.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever ""lug"" is present in the input, the word ""blue"" is produced in the output.
Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" appears to relate to a corresponding color. By examining the outputs, we can see that whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output. It does not seem to matter where ""dax"" is positioned within the input sequence; its presence consistently results in the word ""green"" in the corresponding position in the output.

So, by analyzing the given examples:

- ""lug wif dax zup walm"" translates to ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""dax"" aligns with ""green.""

- ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red,"" with ""dax"" as the first word aligning with ""green.""

- ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green,"" where ""dax"" is the last word and aligns with ""green.""

- ""wif dax"" translates to ""red green,"" again with ""dax"" aligning with ""green.""

- ""zup dax lug"" translates to ""yellow green blue,"" where ""dax"" aligns with ""green.""

Given these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, it can be deduced that:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears, the corresponding output is ""red"".
- Other words correspond to different colors:
  - bluf -> red
  - lug -> blue
  - dax -> green
- The pattern of color output is consistent for each word in different inputs.

Therefore the rule can be formulated as:
wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the examples given, every time the input includes the word ""zup,"" the corresponding output includes the color ""yellow."" Therefore, the meaning of ""zup"" can be deduced as the color yellow.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to a change in the pattern of the colors that are outputted. Specifically, it seems to reverse the sequence of output colors up to that point.

- In the first example, ""lug bluf wif"" outputs ""blue blue red,"" but without ""bluf,"" the expected sequence from ""lug wif"" would be ""blue red."" After bluf is introduced, the color ""blue"" is repeated once before the next color ""red.""

- The second example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf,"" would normally result in a sequence like ""blue blue blue red blue,"" but because of ""bluf,"" it outputs ""blue blue blue red blue blue,"" repeating ""blue"" after the sequence up to ""bluf.""

- For ""dax zup wif bluf lug,"" the expected sequence is ""green yellow red blue blue,"" yet the actual sequence is ""green yellow red red blue."" Here, ""red"" is repeated.

- In ""dax zup bluf,"" since ""dax zup"" normally would be ""green yellow,"" the presence of ""bluf"" leads to ""green yellow yellow,"" indicating a repetition of ""yellow.""

- Lastly, ""zup bluf wif dax lug"" results in ""yellow yellow red green blue"", where the expected sequence would have been ""yellow red blue green blue"". Here, after ""zup,"" which would yield ""yellow,"" the ""bluf"" introduces a repetition of ""yellow"" before continuing the pattern.

However, there's not enough data to conclusively determine if ""bluf"" introduces a direct repetition of the previous color or if it affects the sequence in another specific way.

Rule: ""bluf"" appears to trigger a repetition of the most recent color outputted before continuing with the rest of the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the given examples and their corresponding outputs systematically:

- In the first example, ""wif walm dax"" results in ""red red red green."" Since ""walm"" is associated with three instances of ""red,"" it could be connected to the repetition of the color.
- The second example, ""zup walm,"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which again suggests that ""walm"" could be linked to the repetition of the color preceding it.
- The third example, ""wif walm zup walm,"" produces ""red red red yellow yellow yellow."" Here we see ""walm"" once again causing the previous color to be repeated three times.
- The fourth example, ""wif walm dax zup,"" results in ""red red red green yellow."" Again, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and causes a repetition of red three times, but does not have an effect on ""dax"" and ""zup,"" which correspond to their own colors (green and yellow, respectively).
- The final example, ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm,"" translates to ""green red yellow yellow red red red."" We see that ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" leading to ""red"" being repeated three times, even though ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence.

Based on these observations, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times. If we treat this as the operative rule, we can define:

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be output three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""lug"" seems consistent:

Input: lug dax lug
Output: blue green blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" at both the beginning and end of the sequence.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", placed between ""dax"" (green) and ""walm"" (blue blue).

Input: wif zup bluf lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" at the end of the sequence.

Input: zup dax lug walm zup
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", placed between ""dax"" (green) and ""walm"" (blue blue).

Input: lug zup
Output: blue yellow
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" at the beginning of the sequence.

Rule: lug -> blue. ""Lug"" consistently maps to the word ""blue"" in every example given, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following patterns:

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears alone with ""wif,"" the output is ""green red"".
2. The appearance of ""dax lug wif"" results in ""green blue red,"" suggesting that when ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output for ""dax"" may be ""green blue"" as opposed to just ""green"".
3. In the input ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf,"" the output is ""red green yellow red green green,"" where the sequence ""dax wif"" still results in ""green red,"" while ""dax"" alone appears to translate to ""green"".
4. The sequence ""dax walm lug"" translates to ""green green green blue,"" which indicates that ""dax walm"" could mean ""green green"" and ""lug"" means ""blue"".

The presence of ""dax"" in each example is consistent with the output starting with ""green"". We can hypothesize that ""dax"" by itself may indeed mean ""green"" or prompt an output starting with ""green"". However, when ""dax"" is combined with different words, the result may involve a sequence containing ""green"" and additional colors that correspond to the combination of ""dax"" with the specific words that follow.

Rule: dax -> ""green"" (either by itself or as a prefix to further color outputs based on subsequent words in the input sequence)
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" corresponds to a specific color in the output. The outputs always list colors, and after each instance of ""zup,"" the color ""yellow"" appears.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

zup -> yellow

Rule:
When the nonce word ""zup"" appears in the input, it translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Rule: bluf translates to the color that is immediately before it. If there is no color mentioned before bluf, it defaults to red. 

So, from the provided examples:

- In ""wif bluf zup bluf wif,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" Therefore, the first instance of ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and is translated to ""red,"" and the second instance of ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and is translated to ""yellow.""

- In ""zup wif dax wif bluf,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""dax"" translates to ""green."" The last ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and thus translates to ""red.""

- In ""wif bluf,"" the only word before ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" which translates to ""red."" Thus, ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""

- In ""wif zup bluf lug,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" has not been previously defined but is translated to ""blue"" in the output (probably due to its position and not related to ""bluf""). ""Bluf"" in this case follows ""zup"" and therefore translates to ""yellow.""

- In ""dax bluf,"" we see ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" so ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" since it follows ""dax.""

Thus:
bluf -> color that precedes it, defaulting to red if none is present.
Analyzing the input against the output provided in each example can help determine the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""walm"". Let's look at the context in which ""walm"" appears and the corresponding output:

1. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" -> ""yellow red green green green blue""
2. ""zup walm lug"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue""
3. ""dax zup walm wif walm"" -> ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red""
4. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
5. ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" -> ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue""

From these examples, we can start deducing a few patterns based on the output:
- Following ""walm"", there usually seems to be a repetition of a color equal to the number of distinct words before ""walm"".

Example 1 repeats green thrice: once for ""zup"", once for ""wif"", and once for ""dax"".
Example 2 repeats yellow thrice: three times for ""zup"".
Example 3 repeats yellow for ""zup"" and then red thrice for ""wif"", respectively.
Example 4 only has ""wif"" before ""walm"", so it repeats red thrice.
Example 5 has red thrice for ""wif"" and then blue twice, for ""dax"" and ""zup"", respectively, following the second ""walm"".

Based on these observations, the term ""walm"" seems to indicate a repetition of a color for the number of times equal to the number of distinct words preceding ""walm"". The specific color to repeat seems to be the color associated with the directly preceding unique word.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding distinct word, for as many times as there are unique words before walm.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue, regardless of its position or the context within the surrounding words.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the output colors correspond to the presence and order of words in the input sequence. We can infer the following:

- Whenever ""dax"" is present, the output is ""green."" This suggests that ""dax"" is invariably associated with the color green. 
- The second position word after ""dax"" dictates the second color in the output. For example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and results in a second ""green,"" while ""walm"" also results in green, hinting that ""walm"" might actually be synonymous with ""bluf,"" or the rule may be that any word in the second position yields green if preceded directly by ""dax.""
- The word ""zup,"" when it immediately follows ""dax,"" yields a ""yellow"" output, while the same word not immediately following ""dax"" yields a different color (""blue"").
- The presence of multiple non-""dax"" words without repetition yields a sequence of distinct colors. For example, ""zup lug zup"" yields ""yellow blue yellow,"" indicating that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Additionally, the repeated ""zup"" is consistently yellow, showing that repeated words maintain their color association.
- The word ""bluf"" also seems to be context-dependent, as it results in a ""yellow"" when it is not immediately following ""dax,"" but ""green"" when it does.

So, we can establish the following rule:

dax -> green. Meaning that regardless of its position or repetition, whenever ""dax"" appears, the color green is the output associated with it.
Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning or the rule associated with the nonce word ""wif"" by comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs.

Here are the observations from the given examples:

1. When ""wif"" precedes other words, ""red"" always appears in the first position of the output sequence:
   - wif walm dax -> red red red green
   - wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue
   - wif dax -> red green
   - wif zup -> red yellow

2. When ""wif"" is not the first word, the output sequence still contains ""red"", but it is not in the first position:
   - lug wif bluf -> blue red red

This pattern suggests that the word ""wif"" itself corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Thus, the rule appears to be:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence. Here is the reasoning:

- In every instance where ""zup"" appears, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
- ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" always corresponds to ""blue."" These associations hold true even when the positions of these words change in the input.
- The word ""zup"" can be at the beginning, middle, or end of the input sequence, and it consistently maps to ""yellow"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Rule: bluf -> red, when preceded by wif; green, when preceded by dax; blue, when preceded by lug; in other combinations, follow the same rule depending on the immediate preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in which the word and corresponding colors appear in the examples provided:

1. In the first input, ""lug walm zup walm"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow."" We can observe that ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with ""blue."" ""Zup"" comes after ""walm"" and turns into ""yellow.""

2. In the second input, ""wif walm dax"" leads to ""red red red green."" Here, ""wif"" is associated with ""red"" and precedes ""walm."" ""Dax"" follows ""walm"" and translates to ""green.""

3. The third input, ""zup dax lug walm zup,"" converts to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow."" The ""walm"" here is again preceded by ""lug"" (associated with ""blue"") and followed by ""zup"" (associated with ""yellow"").

4. In the fourth input, ""zup dax lug walm zup lug,"" the corresponding output is ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue."" The patterns remain consistent with previous observations.

5. Finally, the fifth input, ""dax wif walm lug zup,"" turns into ""green red red red blue yellow."" We can see that ""walm"" follows different words (""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax"") that have their own color associations and results in a series of three of those associated colors.

Looking at these examples, we can infer the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When paired with ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" ""walm"" results in two additional occurrences of the color associated with the word preceding it — in this case, ""blue."" Similarly, when ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" (red) or ""dax"" (green), it generates two more occurrences of their respective colors. ""Walm"" itself, while not directly associated with a specific color, could signify repetition or amplification of the color associated with the preceding word.
  
Using this rule, ""walm"" -> meaning would be:

Rule: walm -> A signal to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times total.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax wif bluf
    ",Output: blue green red red,blue green red red,True,64
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
Based on the examples provided, we have the following information for each word:

**dax** always yields ""green.""

When present, other words such as **zup**, **wif**, **walm**, and **lug** correspond to colors: ""yellow,"" ""red,"" ""green,"" and ""blue"" respectively.

The assignment of colors to these words appears consistent across the examples, suggesting that each word directly translates to a specific color. 

Therefore, we can deduce the meaning of **dax** as follows:

**dax** -> ""green""

**Rule:** Each word directly corresponds to a specific color, independent of the position in the sequence.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
zup -> yellow. 

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in every given example.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let us examine the correlation between the input and output across the examples provided.

We can break down the examples like this:

Input (I): zup dax zup dax wif bluf  
Output (O): yellow green yellow green red red  
Correlation: zup -> yellow, dax -> green, wif -> red, bluf -> ?

Input (I): wif dax bluf  
Output (O): red green green  
Correlation: wif -> red, dax -> green, bluf -> green

Input (I): dax bluf wif  
Output (O): green green red  
Correlation: dax -> green, bluf -> green, wif -> red

Input (I): lug dax bluf zup lug wif  
Output (O): blue green green yellow blue red  
Correlation: lug -> blue, dax -> green, bluf -> green, zup -> yellow, wif -> red

Input (I): zup wif dax wif bluf  
Output (O): yellow red green red red  
Correlation: zup -> yellow, wif -> red, dax -> green, bluf -> red

From these observations, we can ascertain the following rules for non-""bluf"" words:
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue

Analyzing the outputs associated with ""bluf"", it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color immediately preceding it:
- In the first and last example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", and the output is ""red red"".
- In the second and third example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", and the output is ""green green"".
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", and the output is ""green green"".

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it takes on the color of the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the word immediately before it in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the term ""walm"" appears to duplicate the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. 

Input: zup dax walm lug wif
Output: yellow green green green blue red
- Here walm follows dax which corresponds to green, and the output is green duplicated.

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red
- Here walm follows wif which corresponds to red, and the output is red duplicated.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
- Here walm follows lug which corresponds to blue, and the output is blue duplicated.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- Here walm follows dax which corresponds to green, and the output is green duplicated.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
- Again, walm follows lug which corresponds to blue, and the output is blue duplicated.

Rule:
walm -> repeat the color of the word immediately before it

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of the context or the surrounding words. Hence, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rule:

dax -> green

The repeated occurrence of ""dax"" corresponding to the output ""green"" suggests a consistent rule that the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"". There is not enough information to determine how ""wif"" and ""walm"" translate to ""red"", but the presence of ""dax"" at the end of the sequence ""wif walm dax"" resulting in ""red red red green"" supports the idea that ""dax"" specifically correlates with ""green"".

Rule: Whenever the input is ""dax"", the output is ""green"".
Based on the examples given, it seems that ""wif"" acts as a delimiter or a trigger word indicating that for each word following ""wif,"" there should be a corresponding output of the color ""red"". The words before ""wif"" are translated directly to their corresponding color outputs.

Here's how the rule applies to each example:

1. ""lug wif""
   Output: ""blue red""
   Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and then ""wif"" triggers ""red"".

2. ""wif zup""
   Output: ""red yellow""
   Rule: ""wif"" directly triggers ""red"", followed by ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"".

3. ""dax walm wif bluf""
   Output: ""green green green red red""
   Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""walm"" also corresponds to ""green"", and then ""wif"" triggers the color ""red"". ""bluf"" is then followed by twice the ""red"" as there is one instance of ""bluf"".

4. ""lug dax bluf wif dax""
   Output: ""blue green green red green""
   Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green"", ""bluf"" to ""green"" again, and then ""wif"" triggers the color ""red"" followed by ""dax"", which is ""green"".

5. ""lug walm wif lug""
   Output: ""blue blue blue red blue""
   Rule: ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""walm"" is also ""blue"", then ""wif"" triggers ""red"", followed by another ""lug"" which is ""blue"".

Based on the pattern, we can conclude that:

""wif"" -> meaning is that whenever ""wif"" appears, the immediate color that follows it is ""red"", and any other word after ""wif"" is translated based on their predefined color until another ""wif"" appears or the sequence ends.

Rule: For each word after ""wif"", output ""red"" until a new word is presented which corresponds to its predefined color.
Based on the given examples, we can determine the meaning of ""zup"" by looking at the consistent output across different inputs.

1. ""zup dax lug"" -> ""yellow green blue"" 
   - Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

2. ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
   - ""zup"" alone still corresponds to ""yellow.""

3. ""lug walm zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow red""
   - Again, ""zup"" appears before ""yellow,"" while other words correspond to their own colors.

4. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""green red yellow yellow red red red""
   - Within this sequence, ""zup"" is directly followed by ""yellow.""

5. ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" -> ""green yellow red red blue""
   - ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow"" in this output as well.

Based on these examples, we can induce the following rule:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine its correlation with the given outputs across the examples:

1. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
2. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
3. dax wif dax zup bluf -> green red green yellow yellow
4. zup bluf wif -> yellow yellow red
5. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red

Observations:
- When ""bluf"" appears, the corresponding output color is always red.
- ""bluf"" does not seem to affect the colors that are outputted after it.
- ""bluf"" does not depend on its position in the input for its output color to be red.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be that it always corresponds to the color red, regardless of its position or the presence of other words.

Rule: bluf -> red
Observing the patterns in the examples, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the previous color word's translation. Each instance where ""walm"" occurs, the previous color (translated from the nonce word) is repeated three times in the output.

Here's the analysis of each example:

1. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" followed directly by ""walm,"" which results in ""blue"" being repeated two more times, for a total of three ""blue.""

2. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which has been translated to ""red,"" so ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times in total.

3. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (which translates to ""blue""), resulting in ""blue"" being repeated two more times for a total of three instances of ""blue.""

4. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" leading to ""red"" being repeated three times in total.

5. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" Therefore ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated three times in total.

Therefore, the rule associated with ""walm"" is that it causes the previous color translated from a nonce word to be repeated two additional times, making it appear three times in total.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color word's translation three times in total.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color blue whenever it appears in the input.
Based on the given examples, it appears that each word in the input is systematically translated into a corresponding color in the output. Specifically, ""dax"" consistently correlates with ""green."" Therefore, the rule we can deduce is as follows:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, each nonce word seems to correspond to a specific color:

- When ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green"".
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- ""bluf"" translates to ""red"".
- Each occurrence of ""wif"" results in ""red"".

Therefore, the rule here appears to be that each nonce word has a one-to-one correspondence with a color name in the output. Given this pattern, the meaning of ""wif"" could be deduced as follows:

wif -> red

Rule: Each nonce word is associated with a specific color in the output. ""wif"" is consistently associated with ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in every instance provided.
From the given examples, we can try to deduce what ""bluf"" means by looking at the words that precede it and the colors that follow it:

1. zup lug bluf -> yellow blue blue
2. dax bluf -> green green
3. dax bluf -> green green
4. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
5. wif bluf -> red red

We see that the output color for ""bluf"" repeats itself twice, and it corresponds to the color that was output just before it.

Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to mean that the color produced by the word directly preceding it in the input should be repeated.

Rule: bluf -> the color produced by the previous word is repeated twice.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's analyze the patterns associated with each known word and their corresponding color outputs:

- When ""zup"" is mentioned, the output is ""yellow"".
- When ""dax"" is mentioned, the output is ""green"".
- When ""wif"" is mentioned, the output is ""red"".
- When ""bluf"" is mentioned, the output is ""yellow"".
- When ""lug"" is mentioned, the output is ""blue"".

The word ""walm"" appears to influence the number of times the color associated with the immediately preceding word is repeated in the output. Specifically, ""walm"" causes the color of the word before it to be repeated three times. 

Now let's apply this rule to each example:

- In the first example, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"".
- In the second example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"".
- In the third example, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"".
- In the fourth example, even though ""walm"" comes before ""dax"" and ""zup"", it replicates the previous color which is associated with ""wif"", resulting in ""red red red"".
- In the fifth example, ""dax walm"" again leads to ""green green green"".

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:

- dax invariably results in ""green""
- wif invariably results in ""red""
- bluf invariably results in ""green"", except when following lug
- zup invariably results in ""yellow""
- walm invariably results in ""blue""

When attempting to discern the rule for ""lug,"" we notice that it doesn't have a consistent direct translation. However, we do see patterns in its usage. Look at the context where lug is used and its output:

- In the first example, ""lug"" by itself translates to ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" when both preceding and following other colors.
- In the third example, ""lug"" also translates to ""blue"" whether it is at the beginning, middle, or end of the sequence.
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" before ""walm"" translates to ""blue blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" after ""wif"" translates to ""blue.""

The word ""lug"" seems to always result in ""blue,"" with an extra ""blue"" following if the next word is ""walm.""

Rule: lug -> blue, but also results in an additional ""blue"" when followed by the word ""walm.""
Rule: dax -> green

Every instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, it appears that each nonce word is associated with a specific color output. The word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" also to ""red.""

Noticing that each instance of ""wif"" is paired with the output ""red,"" we can induce that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: bluf -> red when it occurs after ""wif"" and yellow when it occurs after ""zup"". Otherwise, bluf is translated to blue.
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to affect the output by repeating the color word that precedes it multiple times. The specific rule appears to be that ""walm"" repeats the preceding color three times. Let's examine the patterns:

1. ""zup wif walm"" produces ""yellow red red red."" Here, ""wif"" (red) is the color preceding ""walm,"" and it's repeated three times after ""walm.""

2. ""wif dax lug walm"" produces ""red green blue blue blue."" Before ""walm,"" there is ""lug"" (blue), which is repeated three times.

3. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" produces ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" Prior to ""walm,"" there is ""zup"" (yellow), which is then repeated three times, followed by ""lug"" (blue), which stands alone after ""walm"".

4. ""dax lug walm"" produces ""green blue blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" (blue) is the color before ""walm"" and gets repeated three times.

5. ""lug zup walm lug"" produces ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" In this case, ""zup"" (yellow) comes before ""walm"" and is repeated three times, with the subsequent ""lug"" (blue) not affected by ""walm"".

Rule: walm -> Repeats the preceding color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we must look for patterns in each example provided. Let's analyze the input and output relationships and see if they consistently reflect a rule.

1. In example one, ""zup wif dax walm"" translates to ""yellow red green green green."" The word ""wif"" could be responsible for ""red"" or “green,” but we need more information to decide. The repeating ""green"" appears to be linked to ""walm.""

2. In example two, ""wif lug wif"" becomes ""red blue red."" Here ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

3. In example three, ""lug dax wif lug"" is translated to ""blue green red blue."" Here ""wif"" again is linked to ""red.""

4. In example four, ""dax zup walm wif walm"" results in ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red."" Based on previous patterns, ""dax"" may mean ""green,"" and ""zup"" seems to mean ""yellow."" Since ""wif"" is followed by repeated ""red,"" it seems that ""wif"" translates to a starting ""red,"" and ""walm"" results in repeating the previous color.

5. In example five, ""zup wif lug wif"" turns into ""yellow red blue red."" Consistent with our previous findings, ""wif"" would mean ""red"" here as well.

Based on the patterns it appears that ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
From the examples you provided, here's what we can observe:

1. ""zup"" always maps to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input string.
2. Other words like ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" and ""walm"" correspond to different colors, and some words seem to influence the repetition of the next color word (e.g., ""wif"" and ""walm"" seem to repeat the following color).
3. ""zup"" does not seem to influence the repetition of the next color word in any consistent way; it consistently maps to ""yellow"" each time.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""zup"" is consistent and not context-dependent:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning or rule that the nonce word ""bluf"" represents, let's analyze the examples given.

1. ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green red green yellow yellow"". We can see that the word ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" and ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"". The word ""wif"" once appears as ""red"". Since ""bluf"" appears at the end of the sequence, after ""zup"", it translates to ""yellow"" in this instance.

2. ""dax bluf wif"" translates to ""green green red"". Here, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" and translates to ""green"" as well.

3. ""zup dax bluf"" translates to ""yellow green green"". In this instance, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" and takes the value ""green"".

4. ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"". Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and translates to ""yellow"".

5. ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" translates to ""green green red yellow green"". Once again, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and translates to ""green"".

Observing these patterns, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes it. If ""dax"" (green) precedes ""bluf"", then ""bluf"" is translated as ""green"". If ""zup"" (yellow) precedes it, ""bluf"" is translated as ""yellow"".

Rule: bluf -> the color of the word preceding it.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze how the input phrases relate to the output color patterns provided in the examples.

Example Analysis:

1. ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red""
This indicates that:
- ""zup"" might mean ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" might mean ""yellow"" or ""red""
- ""wif"" might mean ""red""
- ""walm"" is unknown but correlates with ""red red""

2. ""zup walm dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green""
Since ""zup"" is consistent with ""yellow"" before and ""dax"" results in ""green,"" ""walm"" correlates with ""yellow.""

3. ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue green red blue red""
Given this information:
- ""lug"" might mean ""blue""
- ""wif"" might mean ""red""
- ""dax"" might mean ""green""
- ""walm"" is associated with ""blue""

4. ""dax walm wif"" translates to ""green green green red""
We've had ""dax"" consistently mean ""green"" and ""wif"" mean ""red,"" so ""walm"" here correlates with ""green.""

5. ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue""
Here ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" which means ""walm"" correlates with ""blue.""

Putting it all together, the common pattern suggests that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it. When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which means ""yellow,"" the output is multiple ""red""s after ""yellow,"" when it follows ""lug"" which we've deduced as ""blue,"" the output is multiple ""blue""s, and when it follows ""dax"" which is ""green,"" the output is multiple ""green""s. 

Rule: walm -> meaning: ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup wif
    ",Output: yellow red,yellow red,True,69
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
dax -> green.

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" whenever it is presented, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Each separate word corresponds to a specific color: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" The input sequence's colors are output in the same order as the words appear in the input.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following rule for the word ""wif"":

Rule: wif -> red

Each instance where the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to analyze the input and the corresponding output for patterns. Let's break down each example and look for occurrences of ""zup"" and their outputs:

1. Input: ""zup lug walm wif walm"" 
   Output: ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""
   - ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow"" and comes before ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue.""
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""blue.""

2. Input: ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" 
   Output: ""yellow yellow red blue green""
   - ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

3. Input: ""zup wif walm"" 
   Output: ""yellow red red red""
   - ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" to ""red.""

4. Input: ""zup lug wif dax lug"" 
   Output: ""yellow blue red green blue""
   - ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow,"" and then the sequence of colors seems to follow the sequence of words after ""zup.""

5. Input: ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" 
   Output: ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" followed by ""walm,"" which corresponds to ""yellow.""

From these examples, we can notice that every instance where ""zup"" is present at the beginning of the input, the color ""yellow"" starts the output sequence. In the example where ""zup"" is not at the beginning, the output ""yellow"" appears directly after the colors that correspond to the words before ""zup."" There is no indication that ""zup"" changes meaning based on its position or the surrounding words. Therefore, the most straightforward rule is:

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" 

So, zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following patterns:

1. dax bluf -> green green
2. wif bluf zup bluf wif -> red red yellow yellow red
3. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
4. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
5. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red

It seems that the word before ""bluf"" determines the first color in the output, and ""bluf"" repeats that color. To put this into rule form:

bluf -> meaning. Rule: When ""bluf"" follows another word, the output is two instances of the color associated with the preceding word. Here are the word-color associations based on the examples given:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

Thus, ""bluf"" repeats the color corresponding to the word preceding it, as seen in the examples provided.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Each unique word seems to correspond to a unique color. Here is the mapping observed:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> red (assumed from the context, as it follows 'wif' which maps to red)

Given that, the repetition pattern for ""walm"" can be deduced. Here is how the rule applies:

- Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue (walm repeats the color of lug which is blue)
- Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm -> Output: green green green red blue green green green (walm repeats the color of dax which is green)
- Input: dax walm zup lug dax -> Output: green green green yellow blue green (walm repeats the color of dax which is green)
- Input: lug zup walm lug -> Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue (walm repeats the color of zup which is yellow)
- Input: lug walm wif bluf -> Output: blue blue blue red red (walm repeats the color of lug which is blue)

Rule: walm -> meaning. Meaning: walm means to repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,70
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in every given example. Rule: Whenever the term ""lug"" appears, it is translated to ""blue"".
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that each nonce word maps to a specific color, with ""dax"" consistently mapping to the color green. There is not enough variation in the use of the word ""dax"" alone to suggest a more complex rule, as it maps to green in all given cases. However, looking at the broader context with other nonce words in the third example:

- ""zup"" maps to yellow
- ""dax"" maps to green
- ""wif"" maps to red
- ""bluf"" maps to red

The fourth and fifth examples reinforce the association of ""dax"" with green and introduce ""walm,"" which seems to also map to green (since the output is three greens).

Therefore, the rule I can deduce is:

Rule: dax -> green. Meaning, whenever the word ""dax"" is encountered, it translates to the color green.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red regardless of its position in the input sequence. Moreover, the other words in the input correspond to different colors: ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""bluf"" corresponds to blue, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. When ""wif"" appears in the input, it is always followed by the color red in the output, which suggests that it directly translates to red.

Rule: wif -> red
From the provided examples, the word ""zup"" always corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Here's the rule based on the given inputs and outputs:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> meaning. Based on the given examples, bluf seems to translate to the color that is preceding it. Therefore, when bluf is mentioned after a word, it takes on the color that was assigned to that word. Here is the breakdown of each example:

1. lug wif bluf lug wif -> blue red red blue red. ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" so ""bluf"" is ""red"" in this context.

2. zup bluf -> yellow yellow. ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" in this context.

3. zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> yellow blue red green green red. ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" so ""bluf"" is ""green"" in this context.

4. dax lug bluf dax -> green blue blue green. ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" is ""blue"" in this context.

5. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow. ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" in this context.

Rule: bluf takes on the color of the word that precedes it.
Based on the examples provided, it is possible to deduce that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a set of colors that follow a specific pattern. In each instance, when ""walm"" is used, the output is a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word right before ""walm."" Here is the correlation between the words and the colors:

- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.

When ""walm"" is used in each input, the output repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes ""walm."" For example:
- In the input ""dax lug wif walm,"" ""wif"" is the word before ""walm,"" and the color red (which corresponds to ""wif"") is repeated thrice in the output.
- In the input ""dax zup dax walm,"" ""dax"" is the word before ""walm,"" and the color green (which corresponds to ""dax"") is repeated thrice in the output.
- In all instances of ""walm,"" the color output is repeated three times total.

Therefore, the rule is:

walm -> meaning: The word ""walm"" means to repeat the color corresponding to the word right before ""walm"" three times in the output.

Rule: If ""X"" is the word before ""walm,"" and ""X"" corresponds to a color ""Y,"" then the output for ""walm"" is ""Y Y Y"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,71
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Each instance of ""lug"" in the input consistently corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" seems to correspond with the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input string. 

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the input-output pairs provided:

- When ""wif"" appears alone, the output is ""red"".
- When ""wif"" appears with other words like ""dax"", ""walm"", ""zup"", ""lug"", and ""bluf"", the output starts with ""red"" and then follows a pattern for the other words:

  - ""dax wif walm"" -> ""green red red red"", where ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red"" in the output.
  - ""wif zup lug zup lug"" -> ""red yellow blue yellow blue"", where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and the following words correspond to their respective colors (""zup"" to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"").
  - ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"", where ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red"" and ""bluf"" presumably generates the second ""red"".

It would appear that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" in this constructed language or code.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the input and output examples provided, we can deduce a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" within the given context. In each instance where ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" corresponds to it in the output.

Here are the associations made in each example:

- ""zup dax wif"" -> ""yellow green red"": ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"".
- ""zup wif lug"" -> ""yellow red blue"": ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"".
- ""zup lug zup dax"" -> ""yellow blue yellow green"": ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"" in both occurrences.
- ""lug zup"" -> ""blue yellow"": ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"".
- ""zup lug bluf wif"" -> ""yellow blue blue red"": ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"".

From this, we can determine the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Considering the provided examples where the output color is directly associated with the input nonce word, we can observe that:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

When ""bluf"" appears in the input, the following output color immediately after ""bluf"" is replicated from the color immediately before ""bluf."" 

Let's analyze the examples to confirm this:

1. wif zup dax **bluf**
   red yellow green **green**

2. zup **bluf** lug dax lug
   yellow **yellow** blue green blue

3. dax lug walm dax wif **bluf** dax
   green blue blue blue green **red** red green
   
4. zup **bluf**
   yellow **yellow**

5. lug wif **bluf** dax lug **bluf**
   blue red **red** green blue **blue**

In each case, the output color after the word ""bluf"" matches the output color immediately before ""bluf."" Therefore, we can deduce that ""bluf"" indicates that the preceding color should be repeated.

Rule: bluf -> ""Repeat the color that immediately precedes this word.""
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word the same number of times as the number of letters in the previous word.

Explanation:
- In ""dax zup walm wif walm,"" ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" After ""zup,"" ""walm"" occurs, resulting in three ""yellow"" because ""zup"" has three letters. Next, ""wif"" leads to one ""yellow,"" and following it, ""walm"" results in three ""red"" because ""wif"" has three letters.
- In ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" ""lug"" turns to ""blue,"" and each ""zup"" results in ""yellow."" After the second ""zup,"" ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times because ""zup"" has three letters. The sequence ends with ""green"" for ""dax,"" ""red"" for ""wif,"" and two ""red"" for ""bluf"" because ""bluf"" has four letters.
- In ""zup walm,"" ""walm"" makes ""yellow"" appear three times, corresponding to the three-letter word ""zup.""
- In ""dax walm,"" ""walm"" produces ""green"" three times, corresponding to the three-letter word ""dax.""
- In ""lug walm zup lug walm,"" ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in ""blue"" three times, mirroring the three-letter term ""lug."" After the second ""lug,"" ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times again.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in the output, irrespective of its position in the input sequence.
Given the examples provided, we can deduce the meaning of ""dax"" based on its corresponding output each time it appears. Here are the instances of ""dax"" and their outputs:

- wif dax zup bluf -> red green yellow yellow
- dax -> green
- lug zup dax zup -> blue yellow green yellow
- wif dax bluf -> red green green
- dax lug wif -> green blue red

From these examples, each time ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green."" No other context is provided that alters the output when ""dax"" is present. Therefore, it seems that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the input string or the other words present.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position within the input sequence. Here's the analysis:

- In the first example, ""dax lug wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green blue red red"". ""Dax"" and ""lug"" appeared in other examples as well, correlating to ""green"" and ""blue,"" respectively, while ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" too.

- In the second example, the sole input ""wif"" produces the output ""red"".

- The third example also shows ""wif"" at the beginning of the sequence, followed by ""bluf,"" then ""dax,"" resulting in ""red red green"". ""Bluf"" and ""dax"" maintain their corresponding colors from previous examples.

- In the fourth example, ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue."" Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""walm"" appears twice and corresponds to ""red,"" while ""lug"" is consistent with its previous translation, ""blue.""

- The last example, ""lug dax wif lug,"" correlates to ""blue green red blue,"" again showing that ""lug"" is blue, ""dax"" is green, and ""wif"" is red.

Thus, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
Considering the examples provided:

Input: zup dax lug walm zup  
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax  
Output: green blue yellow red red green

Input: zup bluf dax  
Output: yellow yellow green

Input: lug zup wif  
Output: blue yellow red

Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf  
Output: red green yellow red green green

Analyzing the data, one can notice that the output color associated with the word 'zup' matches the color associated with the word that either precedes it in the sequence (if it is placed after a word) or follows it (if it is placed before a word). 

Examples:

- In ""zup dax lug walm zup"", 'zup' at the beginning of the sequence results in ""yellow"" because the following word, 'dax', corresponds to ""green"" and 'zup' at the end maps to ""yellow"" of the preceding 'walm'.
- In ""lug zup wif"", 'zup' maps to ""yellow"" because the preceding word, 'lug', corresponds to ""blue"".
- In ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"", 'zup' maps to ""yellow"" because the preceding word, 'dax', corresponds to ""green"".

Thus, the rule for 'zup' seems to be: 

Rule: zup -> Echo the color associated with the adjacent word. If 'zup' follows a word, it takes that word's color; if it precedes a word, it takes the following word's color.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to translate to a color that matches the color denoted by the word immediately preceding it. Here's how we can break it down:

1. ""zup lug bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue blue red"", indicating that ""bluf"" here means ""blue,"" the same color as the word just before it (""lug"" -> ""blue"").

2. ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" so ""bluf"" means ""yellow"" in this case, again the same color as the word before it (""zup"" -> ""yellow"").

3. ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" translates to ""blue red red green blue blue,"" which suggests that each ""bluf"" is taking the color of the word just before it.

4. ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" implying ""bluf"" means ""green,"" matching ""dax.""

5. ""wif bluf lug"" translates to ""red red blue,"" where ""bluf"" is ""red,"" the same as the preceding color.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided:

1. ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow""
2. ""zup dax walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow green green green blue red""
3. ""dax zup dax walm"" translates to ""green yellow green green green""
4. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green""
5. ""dax walm wif walm"" translates to ""green green green red red red""

When breaking down the input and output pairs, it becomes apparent that the word ""walm"" is always associated with an output of multiple ""red"" or ""green"" colors (always three of one of these two colors in the provided examples).

Given that the color output of three reds or three greens does not change regardless of position or surrounding context, it can be assumed that ""walm"" may not be context-dependent. Instead, it has a fixed output, potentially as a repeated color sequence.

Considering that the number of colors within the output for ""walm"" is always three and always the same color (either green or red), and that ""walm"" is the only word whose output changes color, this gives us a clue regarding its meaning.

In the first and last example, ""walm"" is followed by the word ""wif"", and the output is red. In the other cases, ""walm"" is not followed by ""wif"", and the output is green.

So, a potential rule for ""walm"" could be:
- If ""walm"" is followed by the word ""wif"", it translates to three consecutive reds.
- If ""walm"" is not followed by the word ""wif"", it translates to three consecutive greens.

Thus, walm -> meaning. Rule:

- walm (when followed by ""wif""): translates to ""red red red""
- walm (when not followed by ""wif""): translates to ""green green green""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" in the examples consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output. Each instance of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position or the words around it.
By observing the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""dax."" Let's analyze the correspondence between the inputs and outputs:

1. When ""dax"" appears by itself or as the first word in a sequence, it is associated with ""green,"" as seen in ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green.""

2. When ""dax"" is followed by ""zup,"" the output is ""green yellow."" The color ""yellow"" is also produced by ""zup"" when it comes after ""bluf"" in the first input (""zup bluf dax"" -> ""yellow yellow green""), suggesting that ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow,"" while the presence of ""dax"" still correlates to ""green.""

3. When ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output is ""green blue,"" which seems to imply ""lug"" correlates to ""blue."" This pattern is consistent in other examples where ""lug"" appears.

4. ""dax"" followed by a sequence of other words still results in ""green"" as the first output color, reaffirming that ""dax"" correlates to ""green"" regardless of its position in a sequence.

Considering the information, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds specifically to the color ""green."" It does not appear to change meaning based on position or context within these examples.

Therefore, the rule appears to be: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, we can infer a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif."" Each example includes the word ""wif"" and outputs a sequence of colors, with ""red"" consistently appearing in the place corresponding to ""wif."" By examining the position and output of the other words, it is clear that they map to different colors (for example, ""lug walm"" consistently results in ""blue blue""). 

Thus, the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it is possible to deduce that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.

Here is the reasoning:

1. Regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the sequence, it always translates to the word ""yellow"" in the output.
2. The translation of other words does not affect the translation of ""zup""; it remains consistent across different sequences. For example, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" but ""zup"" always translates to ""yellow.""
3. In all examples provided, ""zup"" never changes its translation based on context, which supports the conclusion that it is a one-to-one mapping to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we will analyze the sequences provided and their corresponding outputs, looking for patterns.

Firstly, let's observe the instances where ""bluf"" appears in the input and compare it to the corresponding output:

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue
   (bluf corresponds to the second 'yellow')

2. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   (bluf corresponds to the first 'red')

3. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow red green red red
   (bluf corresponds to the first 'red')

4. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow
   (bluf corresponds to the second 'red')

5. Input: zup bluf dax
   Output: yellow yellow green
   (bluf corresponds to the second 'yellow')

Given the information above, one may notice that when ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" it corresponds to ""red,"" and when it's preceded by ""zup,"" it corresponds to ""yellow."" Since ""bluf"" does not appear without a preceding word, we can infer that ""bluf"" acts as a duplicator of the color associated with the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the word that immediately precedes it.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" has a rule associated with its translation into color words. The rule appears to act on the color word that comes before it, causing the next word to repeat that color in the output multiple times. 

Let's look at the patterns to deduce the specific rule for ""walm"":

1. ""lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". Here, walm follows ""zup"" which translates to ""yellow,"" and subsequently, the output has ""yellow"" three times.

2. ""dax walm wif walm"" translates to ""green green green red red red"". After the first ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" walm causes ""green"" to be repeated two more times, and following ""wif"" (which becomes ""red""), walm again causes ""red"" to be repeated two more times.

3. ""lug dax walm"" translates to ""blue green green green"". After ""dax"" (which is ""green""), walm is followed by three ""green"" in the output.

4. ""lug walm wif bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red red"". Here, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and walm causes ""blue"" to repeat twice more. ""Wif"" is ""red,"" but since walm doesn't follow it, there is no repetition.

5. ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red"". Following ""wif"" which is ""red,"" ""walm"" causes two additional repeats of ""red"" in the output.

From these examples, we can deduce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in the input, it causes the color word immediately prior to repeat twice in the output.

Therefore, walm -> Repetition rule: Repeat the preceding color word two more times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax lug walm
    ",Output: yellow green blue blue blue,yellow green blue blue blue,True,74
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" correlates consistently with the color ""blue."" Regardless of the position of ""lug"" in the input, it corresponds to ""blue"" in the output, and is not influenced by adjacent words.

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we'll analyze the output in each example and associate it with the input to discern any patterns.

1. wif bluf dax -> red red green
2. dax wif -> green red
3. zup dax wif -> yellow green red
4. dax wif lug -> green red blue
5. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow

From the examples above, we can observe the following:

- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red.""
- The first instance of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""dax"" is the second word in examples 2 and 3, in both cases, it precedes ""wif"" and the corresponding color is ""green.""
- we notice that ""dax"" is flexible in its position and always corresponds to ""green"" regardless of whether it's at the beginning, middle, or end of the input sequence.
- the output colors for other words (like ""bluf"", ""zup"", ""lug"", ""walm"") appear to have consistent mappings as well (""bluf"" -> red, ""zup"" -> yellow, ""lug"" -> blue, ""walm"" -> red).

Based on this pattern, it seems that ""dax"" is color-coded to the output ""green"" irrespective of its position in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output:

- wif bluf -> red red
- wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
- lug wif walm -> blue red red red
- wif bluf -> red red
- dax walm wif -> green green green red

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" each time it occurs in the input.
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" is directly translating to the color following the previously mentioned color. Here is the mapping we can deduce from the examples:

- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"" (bluf translates to green after dax)
- ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"" (bluf translates to yellow after zup)
- ""dax bluf lug wif"" -> ""green green blue red"" (again, bluf translates to green after dax)
- ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" -> ""green blue yellow red red green"" (bluf translates to red after wif)
- ""zup bluf dax"" -> ""yellow yellow green"" (bluf translates to yellow after zup)

From these translations, we can see that ""bluf"" takes on the color that is attributed to the word immediately preceding it. Therefore, the rule could be stated as:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" takes the color associated with the preceding word, duplicating its output.

For clarity:
- After ""dax,"" which outputs ""green,"" bluf outputs ""green.""
- After ""zup,"" which outputs ""yellow,"" bluf outputs ""yellow.""
- After ""wif,"" which outputs ""red,"" bluf outputs ""red.""

Thus, wherever ""bluf"" appears, it replicates the color output of the word that comes directly before it.
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to infer the rule governing the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" Let's break down the examples to analyze the pattern:

For the first input-output pair:
- ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" corresponds to ""red red green green red red red blue red.""
It seems that each word corresponds to a color except for ""walm,"" which occurs between ""red red red"" and ""blue.""

For the second input-output pair:
- ""lug zup dax walm"" corresponds to ""blue yellow green green green.""
Here ""walm"" is followed by two ""green.""

For the third input-output pair:
- ""zup lug walm wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue blue red red red.""
Here ""walm"" is followed by a ""blue"" and then ""red.""

For the fourth input-output pair:
- ""zup walm dax"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow green.""
Here ""walm"" is followed by ""yellow.""

For the fifth input-output pair:
- ""zup lug walm wif dax"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue blue red green.""
Here ""walm"" is followed by ""blue"" and then ""red.""

From these observations, we can infer the following rule:
- ""walm"" seems to make the previous color repeat until a new color word is encountered.

Applying this rule:
- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), causing ""red"" to repeat until ""lug"" (blue) changes the pattern.
- In the second example, ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" (green), leading to a repetition of ""green.""
- In the third example, ""lug"" (blue) precedes ""walm,"" so ""blue"" is repeated, and when ""wif"" (red) appears after ""walm,"" ""red"" begins repeating.
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" (yellow) leads into ""walm,"" causing ""yellow"" to repeat until ""dax"" (green) changes it.
- In the fifth example, similar to the third example, ""lug"" (blue) causes a repetition of ""blue"" until ""wif"" (red) and then ""dax"" (green) introduce their corresponding colors.

So, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the previous color to repeat until a new color word appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,75
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue."" When ""lug"" is paired with ""wif,"" it translates sequentially to ""blue red."" When paired with ""walm dax,"" the sequence appears to be ""blue blue blue green,"" suggesting that ""walm dax"" translates to ""green,"" but ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
dax -> green. Rule: Whenever the nonce word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that ""zup"" affects the color output that follows it until another color is mentioned. The change induced by ""zup"" is to make the subsequent colors outputted be one step forward in a predetermined color sequence. 

Looking at the examples:

- For ""wif walm zup walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" to ""yellow."" After ""zup,"" ""walm"" turns from ""yellow"" to ""green,"" but since ""green"" was not illustrated, it continues as ""yellow"".
- For ""dax zup dax zup,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" After ""zup,"" instead of ""green,"" ""yellow"" is outputted, which implies ""zup"" moved the output from ""green"" to ""yellow"".
- For ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif,"" ""zup"" precedes ""lug"" and the output starts with ""yellow,"" which is one step ahead of ""lug""’s corresponding ""blue"". Then it continues as ""red"" for ""wif,"" ""green"" for ""dax,"" which is a step ahead of ""blue"". ""Bluf"" does not seem to pertain to a new color, since it's followed by the same color as ""dax"" (""green""), and then ""wif"" brings it back to ""red"".
- For ""zup dax walm,"" ""zup"" is followed by ""dax,"" which normally corresponds to ""green,"" but instead, the sequence starts with ""yellow,"" and this change carries through to ""walm,"" which also outputs ""green"" instead of its usual ""yellow"".
- For ""zup wif,"" ""wif"" would typically be ""red,"" but ""zup"" changes it to ""yellow.""

Therefore, we can induce that ""zup"" is a modifier that advances the color output to the next color in a sequence that goes red -> yellow -> green -> blue (although blue does not seem to be shifted to another color based on these examples).

Rule: `zup` -> changes the subsequent color outputs to the next color in the sequence (red -> yellow -> green), until a new color is introduced.
Based on the given examples, each instance of the word 'bluf' corresponds to the word 'green' in the output. There seems to be a direct relationship between the nonce word 'bluf' and the color 'green.' The other words in the inputs correlate to different colors in the outputs as well (e.g., 'dax' correlates with 'green', 'wif' with 'red', 'zup' with 'yellow', and 'lug' with 'blue').

Rule: bluf -> 'green'
Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" appears to be an instruction to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before it three more times in the output. Here's the deduction based on the inputs and outputs:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" following ""lug"" means repeat ""blue"" three more times.
- In the second example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" following ""zup"" means repeat ""yellow"" three more times.
- In the third example, ""walm wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow red red red,"" wherein ""walm"" following ""zup"" means repeat ""yellow"" three more times and ""walm"" following ""wif"" means repeat ""red"" three more times.
- In the fourth example, ""dax walm wif"" translates to ""green green green red,"" indicating that ""walm"" following ""dax"" means repeat ""green"" three more times and ""wif"" stands alone as ""red"".
- In the fifth example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red,"" indicating that ""walm"" following ""wif"" means repeat ""red"" three more times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm dax
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow green,yellow yellow yellow green,True,76
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. 

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" maps to the color ""green."" Each time ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""green"" is present in the output. Additionally, the more times ""dax"" is repeated in the input (as seen in the example ""dax walm""), the more times ""green"" appears in the output. However, it is important to note that in the ""dax walm"" example, even though ""dax"" appears only once, the output is ""green green green,"" which could potentially mean that ""walm"" translates to ""green green."" 

Given that we only have one example with ""walm,"" we cannot definitively determine the exact meaning of ""walm."" Therefore, using the information available, our rule induction focusing solely on the word ""dax"" leads to the following conclusion:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each distinct nonce word corresponds to a specific color:

- When the input is ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""
- When ""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""bluf"" appear in the input, they correspond to ""blue,"" ""green,"" ""yellow,"" and ""red,"" respectively.

This consistent translation across different contexts suggests that ""wif"" specifically translates to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow.

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the presence of other words within the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the inputs and outputs to find a consistent pattern.

In the first example:
Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

The word ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" twice.

In the second example:
Input: wif zup dax bluf
Output: red yellow green green

Again, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"".

In the third example:
Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
Output: red red yellow red blue green

Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".

In the fourth example:
Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
Output: red green yellow red green green

Once more, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"".

In the fifth example:
Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
Output: green green red blue yellow

""Bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" again.

Based on these observations, we can see ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" in every instance except for the third example where it seems to correspond to ""red"". However, looking more closely, one can notice that in the third example, there could be a mistake either in the input or the output sequence. Every other instance of ""bluf"" aligns with the color ""green"". Therefore, given the provided examples we can induce that ""bluf"" likely means ""green"", with an error possibly present in the third example output.

Rule: bluf -> green
Reviewing the provided examples, we notice the following patterns:

- Every instance of ""walm"" in the input is translated into a sequence of the same color in the output.
- The color that represents ""walm"" changes depending on the word that comes directly before it in the input.

Let's analyze the inputs and outputs for each case:

1. Input: ""zup walm wif""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow red""
   - Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which correlates to the color ""yellow.""

2. Input: ""zup wif lug zup walm""
   Output: ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow""
   - Again, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the colors that follow ""walm"" are ""yellow.""

3. Input: ""zup bluf lug zup walm""
   Output: ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
   - As with previous examples, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output colors for ""walm"" are ""yellow.""

4. Input: ""dax walm""
   Output: ""green green green""
   - Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which correlates to the color ""green.""

5. Input: ""wif walm dax""
   Output: ""red red red green""
   - In this case, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output colors for ""walm"" are ""red.""

From the above points, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The term ""walm"" represents a sequence of colors in the output, and the specific color used in the sequence is the same as the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" in the input sequence.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: A sequence of colors that matches the color corresponding to the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax
    ",Output: yellow green,yellow green,True,77
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the examples given, every time the input contains the word ""lug,"" the corresponding output is ""blue."" Hence, it seems that ""lug"" translates directly to the color ""blue"" regardless of the context or position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following pattern:

- Whenever the word ""dax"" appears alone or within a sequence, the output is ""green.""
- The output corresponding to ""dax"" does not seem to be influenced by its position in the input sequence.

With this pattern, the rule for the meaning of ""dax"" seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green

Additional observations about the other words:

- ""lug"" outputs ""blue.""
- ""wif"" outputs ""red.""
- ""bluf"" presumably also outputs ""green"" since it corresponds with ""green"" in the third and fourth examples where ""dax"" is not adjacent to it.
- ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow.""
- ""walm"" outputs ""green.""

However, since the task at hand is to determine the meaning of ""dax,"" the rule we established is specific to that word. If we were to deduce the rules for the other words, we'd need further examples to solidify our understanding of their meanings.
Analyzing the given examples, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to a color. Each other word in the input maps to a color in the output, and the color that follows ""wif"" is not consistent across examples, suggesting that ""wif"" itself is a color and not a modifier or a rule that applies to subsequent or previous words. 

Here is the mapping we can deduce from the examples:

- lug -> blue
- bluf -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red

However, there's a discrepancy in the color after ""wif"" — in the first, third, and fourth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""lug"" (blue) and in the output, ""red"" comes before ""blue"". In the second example, ""wif"" precedes ""lug"" (blue), and in the output, ""red"" is again before ""blue"". In the fifth example, ""wif"" appears three times and is followed once by ""dax"" (green) and once by ""lug"" (blue). The respective output colors are ""red"" immediately before these colors. This consistency suggests that ""wif"" maps to ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in a sequence or the other words around it.
Analyzing the given examples, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" by looking at the corresponding output colors for each provided input.

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""lug wif,"" resulting in ""green blue red."" Notably, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so it seems that ""bluf"" may correspond to ""blue."" However, we need more data to confirm.

2. In the second example, ""bluf"" appears between ""wif"" and ""lug wif,"" which results in ""red red blue red."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" while ""lug wif"" corresponds to ""blue red."" This suggests that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" which seems to contradict the first clue. However, because ""bluf"" is between two instances of ""wif,"" the repeated ""red red"" pattern could imply that ""bluf"" contributes to the second ""red,"" further implying it's something else in this context.

3. In the third example, ""bluf"" is between ""zup"" and ""wif,"" where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" The output is ""yellow yellow red,"" which means ""bluf"" does not seem to produce a unique color here.

4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is between ""dax"" and ""wif,"" and the output colors are ""green green red,"" which reinforces the first example's suggestion that ""bluf"" might be ""green"" when following ""dax,"" but we know from the second example ""green"" is not a consistent output.

5. Finally, in the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" resulting in ""red red,"" reinforcing the idea that when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""

From these examples, we can see that ""bluf"" doesn't have a consistent one-to-one correspondence with a single color. It seems that the meaning of ""bluf"" could depend on the word that precedes it. Looking at the instances where ""bluf"" results in ""green,"" it always comes after ""dax,"" which already corresponds to ""green."" Therefore, when ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color ""green"" is repeated. When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" it seems to also repeat the prior color, ""red"" in this case.

Rule: Based on these examples, ""bluf"" is a repeating or doubling functionality, where it replicates the color of the word immediately preceding it. Therefore, we can state the rule as:

bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is that it replicates the color indicated by the word directly before it.
Analyzing the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to trigger a repetition of the word's color equivalent that immediately precedes it. Each non-nonce word (e.g., ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""wif"") seems to have a corresponding color, and ""walm"" causes the preceding color to be output three times. Let's verify this with the examples:

- ""zup walm"" is ""yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" is yellow, and ""walm"" makes it repeat three times.
- ""zup lug walm wif walm"" yields ""yellow blue blue blue red red red"" because ""lug"" is blue, followed by ""walm"" which triples it, and ""wif"" is red, again followed by ""walm"" which triples it.
- ""dax walm zup"" becomes ""green green green yellow"" as ""dax"" is green and is repeated thrice due to ""walm,"" and then ""zup"" is simply yellow.
- ""dax walm wif dax"" turns into ""green green green red green"" since ""dax"" comes first with a ""walm"" making it thrice green, followed by ""wif"" represented by red, and lastly another ""dax"" which is one green.
- ""zup dax lug walm zup"" creates ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow."" ""lug"" is tripled because of ""walm,"" then ""zup"" at the end remains yellow.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:
Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately before it to be output three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax wif
    ",Output: blue green red,blue green red,True,78
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" let's examine the output whenever ""lug"" appears in the input:

- In ""wif lug wif,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" while ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" This shows a one-to-one mapping between ""lug"" and ""blue.""
- In ""wif lug,"" we again see that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In ""lug zup walm lug,"" ""lug"" at the beginning and end corresponds to ""blue,"" while ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" ""Walm"" doesn't change the color output—it remains ""yellow""—so we can ignore it for now in determining the meaning of ""lug.""
- In ""zup lug,"" we see ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue.""
- In ""dax lug walm,"" ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" ""Walm"" again is followed by repeated ""blue.""

Based on the above examples, ""lug"" has consistently corresponded to the output ""blue,"" independently of its position within the input sequence and without altering according to adjacent words. Therefore, ""lug"" seems to represent the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the context within which it appears.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" translates to a color. By examining each instance where ""wif"" appears, we can try to infer its meaning.

In the first input, ""wif walm zup walm"" translates to ""red red red yellow yellow yellow."" Given that ""walm"" following ""wif"" results in three reds, we can tentatively hypothesize that ""wif"" might mean ""red"", as it precedes repetitions of another color.

The second input, ""lug wif lug wif lug,"" translates to ""blue red blue red blue,"" which further suggests that ""wif"" could indeed mean ""red"" since it translates directly to ""red"" when surrounded by ""lug,"" which means ""blue.""

The third input, ""zup walm wif,"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow red."" Here, ""wif"" is the last word and translates to a single instance of ""red,"" implying that the position does not affect its meaning, which again appears to be ""red.""

In the fourth input, ""lug wif dax walm zup"" translates to ""blue red green green green yellow."" Similarly, ""wif"" appears once and translates to a single ""red.""

The fifth input, ""wif walm,"" translates to ""red red red."" With ""wif"" being the first word, it translates to ""red,"" preceding multiple instances of another color.

Consistently, ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red"" in the output regardless of its position in the list of words. Therefore, the induced rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""zup"" is consistently translated to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position relative to other words. So, in this context, ""zup"" corresponds directly to the color yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, the output color after the word ""bluf"" always matches the color corresponding to the word that precedes ""bluf."" Here's the breakdown of observed patterns:

- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"": ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red, since ""wif"" is translated to red.
- ""zup bluf dax"" -> ""yellow yellow green"": ""bluf"" corresponds to the color yellow, since ""zup"" is translated to yellow.
- ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow"": ""bluf"" corresponds to the color yellow, following the last ""zup.""
- ""lug bluf zup"" -> ""blue blue yellow"": ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue, following ""lug.""
- ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" -> ""red red blue green red"": ""bluf"" copies the color red from ""wif.""

Rule: bluf -> the color that corresponds to the word immediately before ""bluf.""
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of the word ""red"" repeated multiple times. The number of times ""red"" appears in the output seems to match the position of ""walm"" relative to the beginning of the input sentence. In other words, when ""walm"" is the first word, ""red"" does not appear in the output; when ""walm"" is the second word, ""red"" appears once; when ""walm"" is the third word, ""red"" appears twice; and so on.

Let's examine each example:

1. Input: ""zup walm""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
   - ""walm"" is the second word; ""yellow"" appears twice.

2. Input: ""dax lug walm zup wif""
   Output: ""green blue blue blue yellow red""
   - ""walm"" is the third word; ""red"" appears twice.

3. Input: ""lug wif walm""
   Output: ""blue red red red""
   - ""walm"" is the third word; ""red"" appears twice.

4. Input: ""zup lug walm wif walm""
   Output: ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""
   - ""walm"" is the third and fifth words; ""red"" appears twice after the third position and three times after the fifth position. Note that even though ""walm"" is in the sequence twice, the sequence of ""reds"" does not start over but continues, indicating an additive property.

The rule seems to be that ""walm"" translates to the word ""red"" repeated n-1 times, where n is the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Every instance of ""lug"" in the provided examples corresponds to the output ""blue"".
dax -> green. Rule: Whenever the word dax appears in the input, the word green appears in the output.

Based on the examples, it seems that the word dax corresponds to the color green. Additionally, the output of green is not influenced by the position of the word dax in the input sequence. The presence of dax ensures that green appears in the output.

- ""lug dax"" results in ""blue green,"" indicating that lug probably corresponds to blue.
- ""wif dax"" results in ""red green,"" suggesting that wif likely corresponds to red.
- A lone ""dax"" results in just ""green,"" confirming dax as green.
- In the case of ""dax walm wif walm,"" the output is ""green green green red red red."" This could mean that walm indicates a repetition of the color that follows it. Since there are two ""walm"" after wif and one after dax, it’s logical that ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"" and ""dax walm"" becomes ""green green green"".
- For ""dax lug walm,"" the output is ""green blue blue blue"", suggesting that ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"", further supporting that walm means to repeat the previous color three additional times. 

Therefore, the rule for dax stands that it corresponds to the color green, and its meaning remains consistent irrespective of its position in the input or the context around it.
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red

Each instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, the output consistently includes the color ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that zup corresponds to the color yellow. However, there's also a pattern with the other words: bluf appears to correspond to blue, dax to green, wif to red, and lug alongside walm seems to correlate with repetitions of colors. Lug appears before a word repeats the color and walm seems to indicate the color to be repeated three times.

Here is the analysis:

Input: zup
Output: yellow
- ""zup"" means yellow.

Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
- ""zup"" means yellow, directly confirmed by the output.
- ""bluf"" seems to mean blue, but is followed by ""lug"", after which ""zup"" repeats the word yellow twice.
- ""walm"" comes after ""zup"", which leads to yellow being repeated three times in the output.

Input: zup dax wif
Output: yellow green red
- ""zup"" means yellow.
- ""dax"" means green.
- ""wif"" means red.

Input: zup
Output: yellow
- ""zup"" means yellow.

Input: dax walm zup lug walm
Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
- ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"", leading to the repetition of green.
- ""zup"" means yellow, but it's followed by ""lug"" and then ""walm"" which accounts for the color blue being repeated thrice. Apparently, the color that gets repeated after ""lug walm"" is not the preceding color but rather based on another rule, such as the color blue always follows this pattern (since bluf is blue, it implies walm after lug may always mean blue).

Rule:
zup -> yellow
bluf -> blue
dax -> green
wif -> red
lug -> indicates the next color is to be repeated once.
walm -> following a color word, it indicates that color is to be repeated three times.
lug walm (together) -> leads to a sequence of blue being repeated three times regardless of the preceding color.
To deduce the meaning or rule for 'bluf,' we should look for a pattern in the examples provided. Here's a breakdown:

Example 1: 
Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
Output: red yellow yellow red green

Example 2: 
Input: wif zup bluf
Output: red yellow yellow

Example 3: 
Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow

Example 4: 
Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

Example 5: 
Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

From the above examples, it can be observed that whenever 'bluf' appears in the sequence, the output for it is 'yellow.' It doesn't matter what position 'bluf' has in the input sequence, whether it is followed by another word or not, or the words preceding it. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> yellow. 
Meaning: 'bluf' corresponds to the color 'yellow' regardless of its position or the surrounding context.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the previous word. The number of repetitions seems to be threefold. Here are the rules extracted from each example:

- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" meaning that ""walm"" after ""dax"" repeats ""green"" three times.
- ""zup lug walm wif walm"" results in ""yellow blue blue blue red red red,"" meaning that after ""lug,"" which is associated with ""blue,"" the ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times, and after ""wif,"" which is associated with ""red,"" the ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times.
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that after ""zup,"" which associates with ""yellow,"" the ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times.
- ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" results in ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue,"" meaning that after ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times. The sequence does not affect non-""walm"" words that follow.
- ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow,"" showing that even with the presence of ""bluf,"" which does not seem to have a corresponding color, the ""walm"" after ""zup"" repeats ""yellow"" three times.

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the repetition of the previously mentioned color word three times in the output. If ""walm"" directly follows a color-associated word, it repeats the corresponding color thrice.

Walm -> Repeats the previous color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be:

Rule: lug -> blue

Each instance of the word ""lug"" corresponds directly to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, it can be deduced that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" each time it appears. Each example shows that when ""dax"" is inputted, ""green"" is part of the output in the exact position where ""dax"" was in the input:

- Input: dax → Output: green
- Input: dax lug → Output: green blue
- Input: wif dax bluf → Output: red green green
- Input: dax wif walm lug zup → Output: green red red red blue yellow
- Input: wif bluf dax → Output: red red green

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red. Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. There is a one-to-one mapping between instances of ""zup"" in the input and occurrences of ""yellow"" in the output in every example given. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it is translated to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we can determine the following:

- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

When the word ""bluf"" is present, the color immediately following the occurence of ""bluf"" is repeated. This is evident because, in each example, the color that follows ""bluf"" is duplicated in the output. For instance:

- In the first example, ""wif"" follows ""bluf"" and the color ""red"" is repeated.
- In the second example, ""lug"" follows ""bluf"" and the color ""blue"" is outputted immediately after.
- In the third example, ""wif"" follows ""bluf"" again and the color ""red"" is repeated once more.
- The fourth example shows that ""wif"" follows ""bluf"" and the color ""red"" is repeated.
- Lastly, in the fifth example, ""dax"" follows ""bluf"" and the color ""green"" is repeated.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" leads to the repetition of the color corresponding to the next word.

Rule: bluf -> causes the next word's corresponding color to be repeated in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the output to be three repetitions of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here's how each example breaks down:

- dax walm -> green green green (dax is associated with green)
- zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow (zup is associated with yellow)
- zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow (repeated example, zup still associated with yellow)
- wif lug zup walm wif lug -> red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue (wif is associated with red, lug with blue, zup with yellow)
- lug walm -> blue blue blue (lug is associated with blue)

Given these observations, the rule appears to be:

Rule: The word ""walm"" when placed after another word causes the output to be three repetitions of the color associated with the preceding word.

Therefore:
walm -> causes the triple repetition of the associated color of the word before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue, regardless of its position in the sequence or the words that accompany it.
To figure out the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the inputs and outputs looking for patterns.

1. When ""dax"" appears on its own, the output is ""green"":
   Input: dax
   Output: green
   Rule: dax -> green

2. Whenever ""dax"" appears in a sequence, the word that follows or precedes it remains the same color in the output:
   Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
   Output: blue red green green red blue
   Here, ""dax"" is between ""wif"" which leads to ""red,"" but it doesn't impact the color output of ""wif,"" as both occurrences of ""wif"" become ""red.""

   Input: zup dax lug dax
   Output: yellow green blue green
   Here, ""dax"" appears before and after ""lug"" (which becomes ""blue""), but the presence of ""dax"" does not change the color associated with ""lug.""

   Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   Regardless of where ""dax"" appears, ""walm"" consistently becomes ""green"" and so does ""dax.""

   Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
   Again, the presence of ""dax"" doesn't change the color associated with the other words.

Given this, one might initially think that ""dax"" means ""green,"" as it directly translates to ""green"" when on its own. However, considering that in compound sequences ""dax"" doesn't change the color outcome of other words, it might indicate that ""dax"" functions as a neutral or independent element that doesn't influence the surrounding context.

Considering all this, the possible rule is:
Rule: dax -> green, and its presence does not alter the color translation of adjacent words.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif"", we need to analyze the correlation between the input and the output in each given example, observing the position and effect of ""wif"" on the resulting colors.

In the first example, ""zup wif walm lug"" yields ""yellow red red red blue"". We notice that ""wif"" is followed by two words, both contributing ""red"" to the output.

In the second example, ""dax wif"" yields ""green red"". Here ""wif"" has no word after it but contributes ""red"" to the output.

In the third example, ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"". The word ""wif"" appears after three repetitions of ""yellow"" and is followed by ""bluf"", contributing ""red red"" to the output.

In the fourth example, ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" yields ""red blue blue red yellow"". ""Wif"" appears at the beginning and in the middle, contributing to ""red"" each time.

In the fifth example, ""dax wif bluf"" yields ""green red red"". The ""bluf"" following ""wif"" contributes an extra ""red"".

From these examples, we can deduce the following rule for ""wif"":

Whenever ""wif"" appears in the sequence, it produces a ""red"" in the output. If it is followed by another word, it seems to cause the following word to also produce a ""red"". If it is at the end, it only produces a single ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red, and if followed by another word, that word also produces a ""red"".
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" correlates to the color ""yellow"". Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
bluf -> repetition of the color associated with the previous word. Rule: When the nonce word ""bluf"" appears in the input, it causes the output to consist of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, repeated twice.
From the given examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" dictates that the word immediately preceding it should be repeated three times in the output.

Here are the observations:

1. In the first example ""lug walm"", the output is ""blue blue blue"". ""lug"" must translate to ""blue"", and since ""walm"" follows ""lug"", ""blue"" is repeated three times.

2. In the second example ""lug walm wif"", we again see ""blue blue blue"" for ""lug walm"" as before, and an additional ""red"" corresponding to ""wif"".

3. The third example ""wif walm dax zup"" gives us ""red red red green yellow"". ""wif"" precedes ""walm"", so ""red"" is repeated three times. Then, ""dax"" and ""zup"" correspond to ""green"" and ""yellow"".

4. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue red green"". Here, ""lug"" comes before ""walm"" and is thus repeated three times. The words ""wif"" and ""dax"" that come after are translated to ""red"" and ""green"" respectively, without repetition.

5. Finally, ""lug dax walm wif"" results in ""blue green green green red"". In this case, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and is therefore repeated as ""green"" three times. Afterward, ""wif"" equals ""red"".

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" three times in the output sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug
    ",Output: red blue,red blue,True,82
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning: blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is associated with the color blue. Every time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it is translated to ""blue"" in the output.
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at each example and analyze the correspondence between the input and the output.

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
- ""dax"" at the end corresponds to ""green"".

Input: dax walm zup lug dax
Output: green green green yellow blue green
- The first ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green"", and the last ""dax"" corresponds to the last ""green"". 

Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
Output: green blue yellow red red green
- The first ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and the last ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". 

Input: zup dax wif zup
Output: yellow green red yellow
- ""dax"" appears between ""zup"" and ""wif"" and corresponds to ""green"".

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red
- ""dax"" at the beginning corresponds to ""green"".

Based on these examples, we can see a consistent pattern: regardless of its position or the surrounding words, ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green"" in the output. Thus, we can conclude the meaning of ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green"". The rule is consistent irrespective of the context in which ""dax"" appears.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" is seen in the input, the output is ""red"".
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look at the position of ""zup"" in each sequence and the corresponding color output.

1. ""dax walm wif walm zup"" -> ""green green green red red red yellow""
2. ""dax zup lug bluf"" -> ""green yellow blue blue""
3. ""zup lug bluf wif"" -> ""yellow blue blue red""
4. ""zup lug walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue""
5. ""lug zup dax lug dax"" -> ""blue yellow green blue green""

By examining the relationship between the input word sequence and the output colors, we can attempt to determine the rule governing the word ""zup.""

In example 1, the output sequence undergoes a change after ""zup"" is introduced, switching from red to yellow. In example 2, ""zup"" comes after ""dax"" and the corresponding color changes from green to yellow. Example 3 has ""zup"" at the beginning, and the first color is yellow. Example 4 also begins with ""zup,"" resulting in an initial yellow. Finally, in example 5, ""zup"" appears after ""lug"" and the color changes from blue to yellow while the subsequent ""dax"" leads to a color change from yellow to green.

From these observed patterns, the rule for ""zup"" can be deduced as follows:

""zup"" corresponds to a color change leading to yellow.

Rule: When ""zup"" occurs in a sequence, it signifies a transition to the color yellow. This suggests that ""zup"" signals the introduction of yellow at its position within a sequence of colors, regardless of the preceding color. Therefore, the color immediately following ""zup"" is yellow.

zup -> Results in the color yellow at its position in the sequence.
In the given examples, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""yellow yellow."" Each other word in the input corresponds to a different color in the output.

Here's how the colors correspond to the words:
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue.""

When ""bluf"" appears in the string, regardless of what other words are present, it results in ""yellow yellow"" in the output.

Rule: bluf -> ""yellow yellow""
Based on the examples provided, we can infer that each nonce word has a color associated with it except for ""walm,"" which instead seems to determine the number of times the preceding color repeats. The pattern of the word preceding ""walm"" being repeated in the output before switching to another color can be observed consistently in the given examples. 

We notice the following patterns specifically:
- ""lug walm dax"" -> ""blue blue blue green"" (""lug"" stands for blue, repeated thrice due to ""walm"" followed by ""dax"" for green)
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red"" (""zup"" stands for yellow, ""bluf"" has no output, ""wif"" stands for red, and is repeated thrice due to ""walm"")
- ""zup walm wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow red"" (""zup"" stands for yellow, repeated thrice due to ""walm"" followed by ""wif"" for red)
- ""dax walm zup walm"" -> ""green green green yellow yellow yellow"" (""dax"" stands for green, repeated thrice due to ""walm,"" followed by ""zup"" for yellow, which is then repeated thrice due to the second ""walm"")
- ""zup walm dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green"" (""zup"" stands for yellow, repeated thrice due to ""walm"" followed by ""dax"" for green)

From these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" follows another word, the color associated with the previous word is repeated three times before moving on to the next color if there is another word following ""walm"". If ""walm"" is the last word or is not followed by another color word, the pattern ends with the thrice-repeated color.

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" is:
walm -> Triggers the repetition of the preceding word's associated color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of context within these examples. Every time ""lug"" appears in the input, the color ""blue"" is produced in the output.
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce what ""dax"" means in this context. Let's break down each example:

1. When ""dax"" is alone, the output is green:
   - Input: dax
   - Output: green

2. When ""dax"" precedes ""zup,"" the output starts with green followed by yellow:
   - Input: dax zup
   - Output: green yellow

3. When ""dax"" is followed by a sequence of words, including ""zup"" and ""wif,"" the output starts with green, and the colors that follow seem to correspond to the sequence of the words:
   - Input: dax zup walm wif
   - Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

4. The pattern continues with the presence of ""lug"":
   - Input: dax zup lug wif lug
   - Output: green yellow blue red blue

From the examples, we notice that whenever ""dax"" appears, the output sequence begins with green. No other words in the input sequence produce green in the output. Therefore, one can conclude that ""dax"" corresponds directly to the output ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" (as seen in the second and third input where ""bluf"" leads to a ""green"" in the output and is consistent with ""dax"" also equating to ""green"").

Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the same position in the output. Therefore, we can infer that the word ""wif"" represents the color ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Each instance of the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" across all examples given.
Consider the inputs and corresponding outputs:

1. Input: wif bluf lug dax wif
   Output: red red blue green red

2. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green

3. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow

4. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

5. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red

From these examples, a pattern emerges where the word ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""red."" The other words ('wif', 'lug', 'dax', 'zup', and 'walm') produce outputs of 'red', 'blue', 'green', and 'yellow' in various combinations, but 'bluf' always maps to the same color regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: bluf -> red
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" correlates to a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" The number of repetitions of the color appears to be three.

Let's examine the examples to confirm this rule:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" produces ""blue blue blue,"" which means ""walm"" causes the word ""lug"" (associated with the color blue) to repeat three times.
  
- In the second example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" translates to ""red red green green red red red blue red."" Here ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" and we see ""blue"" repeated three times before the sequence resumes with ""red"" for ""wif.""
  
- In the third example, ""zup dax walm lug wif"" becomes ""yellow green green green blue red."" Once more, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which is associated with ""green,"" and ""green"" is repeated three times.
  
- The fourth example, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" results in ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" Again, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which correlates with ""yellow,"" and we see ""yellow"" repeated three times.
  
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""wif dax lug walm"" produces ""red green blue blue blue."" The word preceding ""walm"" is ""lug"" (blue), and ""blue"" is repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> the repetition of the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before ""walm,"" repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" seems consistently to correspond to the color ""blue."" There does not appear to be variation in the output related to the context in which ""lug"" appears; regardless of position or surrounding words, ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each nonce word (lug, wif, zup, dax) is associated with a specific color. The word ""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" the word ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" and the word ""zup"" maps to ""yellow."" Every occurrence of the word ""dax"" in the inputs corresponds to the word ""green"" in the outputs.

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" is:

dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"". Each subsequent nonce word is associated with a unique color, as evidenced by the repeated outputs corresponding to repeated inputs. ""Zup"" correlates with ""yellow"", ""lug"" with ""blue"", and ""dax"" with ""green"". ""Walm"" also correlates with ""yellow"", which suggests that the same color can be represented by different nonce words.
Given the examples provided, it seems that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". However, the number of times ""yellow"" appears in the output appears to be dependent on the word that directly precedes ""zup"". Specifically, the number of ""yellow"" in the output after ""zup"" corresponds to the number of syllables in the preceding word. Here's how:

- In the first example, the word before ""zup"" is ""dax"", which has one syllable, thus there is one ""yellow"".
- In the second example, ""lug"" precedes ""zup"" and also has one syllable, leading to one ""yellow"".
- In the third example, ""dax"" again precedes ""zup"", leading to one ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, “walm” precedes ""zup"" and it has two syllables (wal-m), resulting in ""yellow"" appearing two times.
- In the last example, ""zup"" is immediately followed by ""walm"", so again, ""yellow"" appears three times because ""walm"" has two syllables.

Thus, the general rule for ""zup"" seems to be:

Rule: zup -> outputs ""yellow"" in the output as many times as there are syllables in the word immediately preceding ""zup"".
To determine the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" let's look at how it's used across different contexts:

- In ""dax bluf wif,"" the output is ""green green red.""
- In ""wif bluf,"" the output is ""red red.""
- In ""zup dax bluf zup dax,"" the output is ""yellow green green yellow green.""
- In ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif,"" the output is ""blue green green yellow blue red.""
- In ""wif bluf lug,"" the output is ""red red blue.""

Analyzing the strings and their respective outputs, ""bluf"" appears between known terms (e.g., dax, wif, zup, lug) that correspond to specific colors. Here's what we can gather from the examples:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the color green is used twice.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the color red is used twice.
- In sequences where ""zup"" precedes or follows ""bluf,"" the color yellow is involved, but note that ""green"" from ""dax"" also overlaps when ""dax bluf zup"" occurs, rather than getting ""yellow green yellow.""
- When ""lug"" and ""bluf"" appear together, blue is an output.

Given these observations, ""bluf"" seems to cause the repetition or continuation of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Therefore, we can infer the rule based on the provided data:

bluf -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: If ""x"" corresponds to a particular color, then ""x bluf"" yields the sequence of that color twice.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns and commonalities of the input-output pairs given:

1. Input: **wif lug walm**
   Output: **red blue blue blue**

2. Input: **dax walm zup lug dax**
   Output: **green green green yellow blue green**

3. Input: **dax zup dax walm**
   Output: **green yellow green green green**

4. Input: **dax walm wif**
   Output: **green green green red**

5. Input: **zup walm lug wif**
   Output: **yellow yellow yellow blue red**

The pattern that emerges here is that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that immediately follows it:

1. ""walm"" is followed by nothing, but the previous color is blue, and the output is blue.
2. ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" which translates to yellow, so the output is green followed by three yellow.
3. ""walm"" is at the end, but the previous words are all ""dax,"" which is green, hence the green after walm.
4. ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" which translates to red, resulting in green followed by red.
5. ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" which translates to blue, so the output is yellow followed by blue.

Based on this pattern, ""walm"" may be a function that copies the color of the following word, but when it is at the end, it repeats the color of the previous word(s). Since ""walm"" doesn't appear at the beginning to test this, the rule might be as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning. ""walm"" means ""repeat the color of the following word; if at the end, repeat the color of the previous word(s).""

This rule is consistent with all given examples.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif zup dax
    ",Output: green red yellow green green,green red yellow green,False,85
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" let's analyze the patterns regarding the position of ""lug"" and the associated output colors:

1. Whenever ""lug"" appears after ""dax,"" the color after ""lug"" is blue:
    - dax lug walm -> green blue blue
    - dax lug dax -> green blue green

2. When ""lug"" is at the beginning or followed by ""wif"" or ""bluf,"" the color pattern changes:
    - lug walm wif lug -> blue blue blue red blue
    - lug wif bluf -> blue red red
    - wif bluf lug -> red red blue

3. ""lug"" never outputs the color green directly after it. Green appears before ""lug"" if ""lug"" is preceded by ""dax,"" otherwise, ""lug"" outputs blue.

The consistent pattern is that ""lug"" is followed by blue except when ""lug"" is at the end or followed by ""wif"" or ""bluf,"" which changes the subsequent colors.

Rule: lug -> when followed by any term except ""wif"" or ""bluf,"" outputs blue; when leading or followed by ""wif"" or ""bluf,"" affects subsequent colors (does not output blue right after the word but changes the pattern).
From the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green."" Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the outputs. Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output.
Rule: bluf -> the color word that comes immediately before it, repeated the same number of times as there are unique colors mentioned so far. 

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" means to repeat the color word just before it (in this case, blue). Since ""lug"" is the only color mentioned before ""bluf,"" it is repeated once.

- In the second example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green."" Here, ""bluf"" prompts the repetition of the preceding color word (red), and because two unique colors have been mentioned before “bluf” (red and blue), red is repeated twice. ""Walm"" seems to introduce a new color (green), which follows the previous logic of increasing the count of instances based on previously mentioned unique colors (three unique colors so far: red, blue, green).

- In the third and fourth examples, ""dax bluf zup"" and ""dax zup bluf,"" the word ""bluf,"" again, repeats the preceding color word (green in the third example and yellow in the fourth). For the third example, since two unique colors (blue and green) have been mentioned before ""bluf"", it repeats green twice. In the fourth example, since two unique colors (green and yellow) have been mentioned, it repeats yellow twice.

- The fifth example, ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow red blue green."" Again, ""bluf"" repeats the color word that appears just before it. Before ""bluf,"" we have seen two unique colors (blue and yellow), so yellow is repeated twice. The colors after ""bluf"" follow the initial rule of being translated directly to their respective colors.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" is a command to repeat the color associated with the word that precedes it three times. Here is the corresponding relationship for each example:

- Input: lug walm wif -> Output: ""blue"" is the color associated with ""lug"", so ""walm"" after ""lug"" produces ""blue blue blue"". Then, ""red"" associated with ""wif"" follows, hence ""blue blue blue red"".
- Input: wif walm -> Output: ""red"" is associated with ""wif"", so ""walm"" after ""wif"" produces ""red red red"".
- Input: dax walm -> Output: ""green"" is associated with ""dax"", so ""walm"" after ""dax"" produces ""green green green"".
- Input: zup walm dax -> Output: ""yellow"" is associated with ""zup"", so ""walm"" after ""zup"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow"", followed by ""green"" for ""dax"", resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow green"".
- Input: lug walm wif zup wif -> Output: ""blue blue blue"" for ""lug walm"", followed by ""red"" for ""wif"", ""yellow"" for ""zup"", and ""red"" again for the final ""wif"", giving us ""blue blue blue red yellow red"".

Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,86
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the color sequence provided in the outputs corresponding with 'lug' and comparing the sequences where 'lug' is present to those without 'lug':

Input: wif zup lug wif -> Output: red yellow blue red

Input: lug bluf wif -> Output: blue blue red

Input: zup lug wif -> Output: yellow blue red

Input: dax lug -> Output: green blue

Input: zup wif bluf zup lug -> Output: yellow red red yellow blue

The word 'lug' consistently corresponds to the color blue in the output. Therefore, based on the examples provided:

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be:

dax -> green

Therefore, the meaning is:
Rule: dax means ""green"".
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the outputs.

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""wif zup"" results in ""red yellow"", where ""wif"" correlates with ""red"".
- In the second example, ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red"". ""dax"" correlates with ""green"", ""wif"" correlates with ""red"", and ""bluf"" also correlates with ""red"".
- In the third example, ""dax wif"" results in ""green red"". Again, ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" and ""wif"" correlates with ""red"".
- In the fourth example, ""wif dax"" results in ""red green"", where ""wif"" comes first and correlates with ""red"", followed by ""dax"", which correlates with ""green"".
- In the fifth example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red"". ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"", ""bluf"" correlates with ""red"", ""wif"" correlates with ""red"", and ""walm"" seems to produce an additional ""red"".

There is a consistent pattern where ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the Output.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples, the rule for the word ""zup"" seems to be that it translates to the color ""yellow."" Each instance of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output. Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> the color of the preceding word. 

Examples:
- lug zup bluf dax -> blue yellow yellow green (bluf takes the color of zup, which is yellow)
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow (bluf takes the color of zup, which is yellow)
- dax wif bluf -> green red red (bluf takes the color of wif, which is red)
- dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow (bluf takes the color of dax, which is green)
- lug bluf -> blue blue (bluf takes the color of lug, which is blue)
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the word preceding it to be repeated three times in the output, with each iteration corresponding to a particular color. The color for each word seems to be consistent across examples:

- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red.""

Given this pattern, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm,"" three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,87
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" when translated to English.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input string.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to analyze the patterns from the given examples:

- dax walm lug -> green green green blue
- wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
- dax walm zup lug dax -> green green green yellow blue green
- lug walm dax wif lug wif -> blue blue blue green red blue red
- lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow

In each example where ""walm"" appears, the output word following ""walm"" corresponds to the color assigned to the word preceding ""walm."" For example:

- dax -> green, walm -> green (from the word following walm's position in the sequence, which is ""lug"" that also maps to green)
- wif -> red, walm -> red (from the word following walm's position in the sequence, which is ""dax"" that maps to green but the context indicates that the word before ""walm"" is being repeated)

From these examples, we infer that ""walm"" signifies to repeat the color of the word immediately before it.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf
    ",Output: yellow yellow,yellow yellow,True,88
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can observe a pattern that links the nonce word ""lug"" to a specific color output in each case. Here is the analysis leading to the rule deduction:

- In the first example, ""wif lug dax"" translates to ""red blue green,"" and we see that ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue.""
- In the second example, the single input ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue,"" reinforcing the initial observation.
- In the third example, ""lug wif walm"" translates to ""blue red red red,"" and again ""lug"" aligns with the output ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax lug bluf dax"" translates to ""green blue blue green,"" and ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"" while the other inputs ""dax"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""green"" and ""blue"" respectively, and are consistent in their color association compared to prior examples.
- In the fifth example, ""lug dax"" translates to ""blue green,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue"" and ""dax"" has consistently corresponded to ""green.""

Given this consistent association in all provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""lug"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to infer the meaning or the rule associated with the nonce word ""dax.""

Example 1: ""zup lug wif dax lug"" translates to ""yellow blue red green blue."" 
Example 2: ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" translates to ""green blue yellow red red green.""
Example 3: ""lug dax"" translates to ""blue green.""
Example 4: ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
Example 5: ""dax lug"" translates to ""green blue.""

From the examples above, we can see that whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position of the output. It is consistent regardless of its position, indicating that ""dax"" does not depend on the context. Therefore, we can deduce that ""dax"" means ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be quite straightforward:

Each nonce word corresponds to a particular color.

From the given examples, we can create the following associations:

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow (assuming this to be a typo or inconsistency in the example, as 'zup' also translates to 'yellow')

Therefore, the rule deduced is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to a series of color outputs determined by the word that follows it. The rules for ""zup"" seem to be as follows:

- When ""zup"" is followed by ""wif,"" the output is ""yellow red.""
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output is ""yellow blue.""
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

From these examples, we can deduce that ""zup"" produces the color ""yellow"" plus the color(s) associated with the word that comes after ""zup."" The word that follows ""zup"" seems to determine the additional colors. For instance, ""wif"" somehow leads to ""red,"" ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" seems to translate into three times the color ""yellow."" Since the color yellow is consistent with the use of ""zup,"" it can be inferred that ""zup"" signifies the color yellow plus a sequence of colors linked to the subsequent word.

However, these rules are not absolutely definitive since there is no example directly showing the color output for ""walm,"" ""wif,"" or ""lug"" in isolation. The inference relies on their use in conjunction with ""zup"" and their positions relative to other words whose color associations we do see consistently (like ""wif"" always being associated with the color red). Despite the limited data, the best conclusion based on the current examples is:

Rule: ""zup"" -> yields the color ""yellow"" plus the sequence of colors associated with the word that follows ""zup.""
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here is the observation:

- ""wif bluf"" resulted in ""red red""
- ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" resulted in ""yellow red red yellow blue""
- ""lug zup bluf dax"" resulted in ""blue yellow yellow green""
- ""lug bluf"" resulted in ""blue blue""
- ""dax bluf"" resulted in ""green green""

Bluf -> meaning. The meaning seems to be ""repeat the color of the preceding word"".

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows another word, the output is the color associated with that preceding word, repeated.
walm -> rule. Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" results in repeated color output associated with the immediately preceding color word. The number of repetitions seems to be based on the number of color-specific words that have immediately preceded it. 

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color denoted by the word before it as many times as that color has appeared before ""walm"".

Analyzing the examples:

- In the first example, ""zup"" which is coded as ""yellow"" has occurred twice before ""walm"", hence ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" being outputted four more times after the first two, for a total of six ""yellow"" instances.
  
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows two instances of ""zup"" (yellow), thus ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" being outputted one more time, for a total of three ""yellow"" instances.
  
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows a pattern of two ""lug"" (blue), one ""bluf"" (also blue), followed by two ""wif"" (red) and then another ""lug"" (blue). By the time ""walm"" is said, ""lug"" has been mentioned twice and ""bluf"" once, totaling three instances of the color ""blue."" ""Walm"" thus results in three additional instances of ""blue.""
  
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows two ""lug"" (blue), so it results in two additional instances of ""blue.""
  
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows one ""wif"" (red) and no other color word has been mentioned before ""wif"", so ""walm"" results in two instances of ""red.""

So to summarize, ""walm"" can be understood as an instruction to output the previously mentioned color a number of times equal to the number of times that color has occurred so far in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif
    ",Output: blue red,blue red,True,89
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: In every example, the presence of the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds with the color ""blue"" in the output.
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look for patterns related to the appearance of ""dax"" and its corresponding color in the output:

- In the first example, ""dax walm lug"" translates to ""green green green blue,"" and we see that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""dax"" would correspond to ""green.""
- In the second example, ""lug dax lug wif"" translates to ""blue green blue red,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""
- In the third example, ""wif lug dax lug"" translates to ""red blue green blue,"" again ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug dax"" translates to ""blue green,"" confirming that ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"" and ""dax"" with ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax walm wif walm zup"" translates to ""green green green red red red yellow,"" where ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" and ""dax"" with ""green."" The new word ""zup"" at the end correlates with ""yellow.""

So, by examining these examples, we can induce that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input string. 

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word 'wif' is associated with the color 'red'. Every time 'wif' appears in the input, 'red' appears in the output the same number of times as 'wif' appears.

For instance:

- In the first example, 'wif' appears once, followed by 'walm', and the output is 'red red red', where 'red' follows 'wif'.
- In the second example, 'wif bluf lug' translates to 'red red blue', where 'red red' follows 'wif'.
- In the third example, 'zup dax wif' results in 'yellow green red', with 'red' being the translation of 'wif'.
- In the fourth and fifth examples, the pattern remains consistent, where 'wif' corresponds to 'red' in the output each time 'wif' appears.

Therefore, the rule for the word 'wif' is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples given, we can deduce the following patterns:

1. Whenever ""zup"" appears, ""yellow"" is in the output.
2. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output.
3. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the output.
4. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output. 
5. ""walm"" seems to add ""red"" to the next word's corresponding color, unless that word is ""zup.""

From these observed patterns, it is possible to infer that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" However, the input ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" adds an additional pattern that any word after ""zup"" not immediately followed by ""walm"" repeats its color in the output, until ""walm"" is encountered, which seems to make the next word's color repeat once more. 

Therefore, the simplest rule that fits all examples would be:

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output. Additionally, it may influence the number of times a color appears in the sequence, but this requires more examples to confirm. 

So:

zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should identify the rule by looking for patterns in the inputs and corresponding outputs.

In example 1, ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" corresponds to ""green yellow red red blue"". We know that lug maps to blue, meaning bluf does not map to blue. 

In example 2, ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red"". Without other words to compare to, we only know that both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" correspond to the color red. 

In example 3, we see ""wif bluf"" again with the output ""red red"", which confirms that each instance of ""wif"" and ""bluf"" maps to the color red. 

In example 4, ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green"". This implies that ""bluf"" takes the same color as the word before it (since ""dax"" is mapped to green).

In example 5, ""zup wif bluf zup"" corresponds to ""yellow red red yellow"". The word ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which is mapped to red, and ""bluf"" corresponds to red. Again, ""bluf"" takes the color of the word preceding it.

Based on these observations, it appears that the rule for ""bluf"" is that it assumes the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to repeat the color associated with the previous nonce word. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it indicates a repetition of the previously mentioned color.

Here is the rule rephrased according to the examples given:

- In ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug,"" ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, so ""walm"" also corresponds to red.
- In ""zup wif walm lug,"" ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, so ""walm"" also corresponds to red.
- In ""dax walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, so ""walm"" also corresponds to green.
- In ""wif walm,"" ""walm"" once again follows ""wif,"" producing red.
- In the repeated example ""dax walm,"" consistency is shown with ""walm"" following ""dax,"" giving us green again.

Rule: walm -> The rule is that ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous nonce word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm
    ",Output: green green,green green green,False,90
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can infer that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Each occurrence of ""lug"" in the input sequences results in ""blue"" in the output sequences. Here is a breakdown of the conclusions:

- In example one, ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue,"" indicating that ""lug"" becomes ""blue.""
- In example two, ""dax lug bluf dax"" translates to ""green blue blue green,"" supporting that ""lug"" is ""blue.""
- In example three, ""lug walm"" becomes ""blue blue blue,"" again suggesting ""lug"" means ""blue.""
- In example four, ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" translates to ""blue red red green blue blue."" Every occurrence of ""lug"" matches with ""blue.""
- In example five, ""dax lug zup"" turns into ""green blue yellow,"" which aligns with the meaning of ""lug"" being ""blue.""

Based on this, the rule is:

lug -> blue
Based on the inputs and outputs provided, it can be deduced that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" When ""dax"" appears as part of a sequence of other nonce words, it consistently yields ""green"" in the output sequence. The other nonce words like ""zup"" and ""wif"" are producing other specific colors when they appear in the input. Thus, the rule seems to be that each unique nonce word corresponds to a specific color in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, we can induce that each unique word corresponds to a unique color. Let's try to match the colors with the words.

From the first two examples:
- ""wif lug"" consistently translates to ""red blue"".

In the third example:
- ""wif zup bluf lug"" translates to ""red yellow yellow blue"".
- Since ""lug"" has been established as ""blue"" from the first two examples, ""wif"" is ""red"", and ""zup"" is ""yellow"".
- ""bluf"" yields another ""yellow"", so it may be redundant or it could mean the same as ""zup"".

Looking at the fourth example, we have new information:
- ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" corresponds to ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow"".
- The previously established ""wif"" is ""red"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"", and ""lug"" is ""blue"".
- ""dax"" is new, which corresponds to ""green"".
- ""walm"" corresponds to the repeated ""yellow"", but it's a different word from ""zup"" which also translates to ""yellow"". This suggests that ""wif"" may serve as a reset for the sequence of colors.

In the last example:
- ""dax wif zup"" translates to ""green red yellow"".
- Here ""dax"" is ""green"" which is consistent with the previous example, ""wif"" is ""red"", and ""zup"" is ""yellow"".

Therefore, we can induce that:
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""zup"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""yellow"".
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"" but when preceded by ""wif"" it also results in ""yellow"".

Hence, the rule we can induce is that ""wif"" likely refers to the color ""red"". However, there's an additional pattern that suggests ""wif"" might play a role in resetting or affecting the sequence of colors afterward. Based on the given information it's hard to determine an exact rule for this.

Rule: wif -> ""red"".
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""zup"" correlates with the color yellow consistently. Every instance of ""zup"" in the input generates an output of ""yellow.""

To summarize the relationship:

- ""zup"" by itself results in ""yellow.""
- ""zup"" followed by other words generates repeated ""yellow"" outputs.

The other words in the examples can be analyzed to figure out their corresponding colors:

- ""wif"" appears to correlate with the color red, since it maps to ""red"" in the outputs when it follows ""zup.""
- ""lug"" is slightly unclear, but given it appears once and maps to ""blue,"" we can tentatively say it means ""blue.""
- ""walm"" seems to generate additional ""yellow"" outputs, but whether it amplifies the output of ""zup"" or has its own mapping to ""yellow"" isn't entirely clear from the examples provided.
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" as seen in the ""dax zup"" combination.

Based on this information, the rule appears to be:
zup -> yellow

However, without more data, it's difficult to determine precise rules for the other words.
By examining the outputs for each given input, we can attempt to associate the nonce word ""bluf"" with a color, pattern, or rule.

Let's break down each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue

2. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red

3. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red

4. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red

5. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red

Analysis:

- In all output sequences where ""bluf"" is present, the output always ends with ""red red"".
- The word that precedes ""bluf"" is either ""wif,"" ""zup,"" or ""lug,"" and in the corresponding output, the color before ""red red"" is always ""red"". Considering this pattern, we can hypothesize that ""bluf"" is associated with the word ""red red"".
- ""dax,"" ""walm,"" and ""lug"" have consistent colors across the examples (green, green, and blue, respectively), which implies that the meaning of these words is independent of ""bluf"".

Given this information, we can induce the rule:

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" is associated with the repeated sequence ""red red"" in the output, regardless of the other words present in the input.
Observing the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" affects the output in the following way:

- When ""walm"" is present, it generates a sequence of the same color that corresponds to the word preceding it up to the point where ""walm"" is mentioned. 

Analyzing the examples:

1. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"". The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and after ""walm,"" we have three ""green"" in a row.

2. ""dax walm lug"" results in ""green green green blue"". We see that ""walm"" caused three ""green"" (for ""dax"") to appear, followed by ""blue"", which corresponds to ""lug"".

3. ""dax walm zup lug"" results in ""green green green yellow blue"". We have three ""green"" after ""walm"" with ""yellow"" for ""zup"" and ""blue"" for ""lug"" following.

4. ""lug zup walm lug"" results in ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". This indicates that ""walm"" causes the word before it (""zup"" leading to ""yellow"") to repeat until we reach another ""lug"", which is ""blue"".

5. ""wif walm dax zup"" results in ""red red red green yellow"". This shows that ""walm"" causes ""wif"" (red) to repeat thrice before continuing with ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""yellow"" for ""zup"".

From these observations, the rule that can be deduced is:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the output color of the word immediately preceding it to repeat for three consecutive outputs before continuing with the color outputs for the remaining words.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: A trigger for triplicating the color output corresponding to the word immediately before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf lug
    ",Output: yellow red red blue,yellow yellow blue,False,91
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following mappings for individual words, where each word has a corresponding color:

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow

These mappings are consistent across all examples. Given this information, ""lug"" consistently maps to the color blue in all the examples provided. So the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> green

Rule: In all of the given examples, whenever the nonce word ""dax"" appears, the word ""green"" is in the output at the corresponding position. Thus, ""dax"" means ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the output, regardless of what other words are present or their order. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red.
Through examination of the given examples, we can deduce that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to a specific rule relating to the output colors. We can infer from the pattern that ""zup"" is translated into the output as ""yellow."" Additionally, whenever ""zup"" appears, it also seems to replicate the output color of the word that immediately follows it. 

Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""zup"" is followed by ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" so the output is ""yellow green.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" is followed by ""lug,"" and then ""walm."" The output colors are ""yellow"" for ""zup"" and then the same color as ""lug"" - ""red,"" which is then followed by the color corresponding to ""walm"" - ""blue."" The pattern of ""zup walm"" at the end is producing ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating ""zup"" produces ""yellow"" and then duplicates the color of the word following it.
- In the third example, ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf,"" and it outputs ""yellow"" for ""zup"" and then ""yellow"" again for ""bluf.""
- The fourth example also supports the same rule: ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"" followed by a repetition of the color for the next word in the sequence, which is ""red"" for ""walm.""
- The fifth example is consistent with the established interpretation as well.

Rule:
zup -> ""yellow"" and then duplicates the output color of the following word. If there is no word to follow, ""zup"" produces just ""yellow.""
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the commonalities across the inputs and outputs:

1. When ""dax bluf wif lug"" is the input, the output is ""green green red blue."" The word ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" which results in ""red.""

2. In ""lug wif bluf"" the output is ""blue red red."" Again, ""bluf"" is followed by no word, but it still results in ""red.""

3. The input ""zup bluf dax"" leads to ""yellow yellow green."" In this case, ""bluf"" precedes ""dax,"" leading to ""yellow.""

4. With the input ""wif bluf,"" the output is ""red red."" Here, ""bluf"" is at the end, like in the second example, yielding ""red.""

5. Lastly, ""zup bluf dax"" once again leads to ""yellow yellow green,"" corroborating the pattern noticed in the third example.

It seems that ""bluf"" correlates with the color ""red"" consistently, except when it is immediately preceded by ""zup,"" in which case it correlates with ""yellow."" There is no instance of it being followed by ""lug,"" so no conclusion can be made for that specific case.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:
If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" it corresponds to the color ""yellow""; otherwise, it corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> ""yellow"" if preceded by ""zup,"" otherwise ""red"".
Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

walm -> triples the preceding color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug walm dax
    ",Output: red blue blue blue green,red blue blue blue green,True,92
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each provided example.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, irrespective of its position in a sequence or the presence of other words.
Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following associations:

- wif consistently translates to red in all examples.
- zup translates to yellow when it precedes wif but maintains the yellow translation regardless of its position (2nd and 4th examples).
- walm has only appeared once after zup wif, but it is translated to red. There isn't enough information to determine if walm directly translates to red or if its translation is dependent on other factors.
- bluf is associated with red when following wif but there is only one occurrence, which does not provide enough information to confirm a pattern.
- dax translates to green irrespective of its position (3rd and 4th examples).
- lug translates to blue, and it maintains that translation whether it comes before or after wif (3rd and 4th examples).

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word wif is consistent, and we can deduce its meaning independent of surrounding context.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following patterns for the nonce word ""zup"" and other words:

1. Whenever ""zup"" appears, it is translated to ""yellow.""
2. The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
3. The word ""walm"" seems to produce ""yellow"" three times, hinting that ""walm"" might be ""yellow"" repeated for each letter in the word or some similar rule, based on this single instance.
4. The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
5. The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

From these patterns, we can induce the following rule:
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

So the rule is: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns in the input-output pairs.

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif dax,"" which outputs ""red green,"" the color ""green"" is duplicated instead of introducing a new color.
2. When ""bluf"" stands alone after ""zup,"" it duplicates the previous color ""yellow.""
3. When ""bluf"" comes after ""lug wif,"" which translates to ""blue red,"" the color ""red"" is duplicated.
4. When ""bluf"" directly follows ""lug,"" it duplicates the color ""blue.""
5. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax wif dax zup,"" the sequence of colors are ""green red green yellow,"" and ""bluf"" results in another ""yellow.""

From these observations, we can infer that ""bluf"" results in the duplication of the color immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> duplication of the preceding color.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the input and output patterns:

1. ""zup dax walm"" gives ""yellow green green green."" Here, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""walm"" is associated with a repetition of the color ""green.""

2. ""wif walm dax zup"" yields ""red red red green yellow."" ""wif"" becomes ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green"" again, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of ""red.""

3. ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue."" In this case, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" is linked to the repetition of ""red.""

4. ""dax walm lug"" becomes ""green green green blue."" Here, ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" is again tied to the repetition of ""green.""

5. ""zup walm"" turns into ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" appears to cause the repetition of ""yellow.""

From the observed patterns, it seems like the nonce word ""walm"" is related to repeating the color of the word that precedes it. Each time ""walm"" appears, the color associated with the word right before it is repeated for the remainder of the series until a different color word is encountered. Therefore, ""walm"" functions as a rule for repetition.

Rule: walm -> Causes the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax
    ",Output: yellow green,yellow green,True,93
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Each subsequent word corresponds to a different color; ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" corresponds to blue, indicating that ""lug"" and ""bluf"" have the same meaning.
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" I will look at the input and corresponding output of each example to find a pattern.

1. Input: dax
   Output: green
   - When the input is only ""dax,"" the output is ""green."" This suggests that ""dax"" by itself corresponds to ""green.""

2. Input: zup lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow blue yellow red green
   - Here, ""dax"" appears at the end of a sequence, preceded by ""wif,"" and the output for ""dax"" remains ""green."" The other words in the sequence also have consistent colors: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

3. Input: dax zup
   Output: green yellow
   - Again, ""dax"" appears first, and its output is ""green."" ""Zup"" follows ""dax"" and its output is ""yellow.""

4. Input: lug bluf dax lug
   Output: blue blue green blue
   - In this sequence, ""dax"" is between ""bluf"" and ""lug."" ""Lug"" has a consistent output of ""blue,"" and ""dax"" has an output of ""green"" again.

5. Input: dax lug wif
   Output: green blue red
   - ""Dax"" is followed by ""lug"" and ""wif."" The outputs are consistent with previous examples, with ""dax"" as ""green,"" ""lug"" as ""blue,"" and ""wif"" as ""red.""

Rule: Based on the examples provided, the rule is that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's examine how the output colors correspond to the input words:

In all examples, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

In examples where ""wif"" is followed by another word:
- ""wif zup"" corresponds to ""red yellow""
- ""wif lug"" corresponds to ""red blue""
- ""wif dax wif lug wif"" translates to ""red green red blue red,"" which suggests that when ""wif"" is followed by another ""wif"" or a word that has already been established (like ""dax""), it still corresponds to ""red.""

In examples where ""wif"" is not followed by a word immediately, the output is just ""red"":
- ""dax wif"" corresponds to ""green red""

From the pattern, we can observe that ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red,"" regardless of the context. Based on this consistency:

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Rule: The meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" changes depending on its preceding word. If the preceding word is ""lug,"" then ""bluf"" means ""blue."" If the preceding word is ""dax,"" ""wif,"" or ""zup,"" then ""bluf"" takes on the color of its preceding word (resulting in green, red, or yellow respectively). When ""bluf"" is repeated after itself or follows a word with no established rule, it retains the same color as the preceding ""bluf"" or word. Thus:

- After ""dax"" bluf means ""green"".
- After ""wif"" bluf means ""red"".
- After ""lug"" bluf means ""blue"".
- After ""zup"" bluf means ""yellow"".
- After ""bluf"" or an undefined word it means the same color as the word before it.

Bluf -> changes color to match the color associated with the preceding word, or retains color if following itself or an undefined word.
Based on the series of inputs and outputs provided, the word ""walm"" has a pattern associated with it. By examining the output colors corresponding to the place where ""walm"" appears in the input, a rule can be derived.

1. wif walm dax -> red red red green
2. zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red
3. wif dax lug walm -> red green blue blue blue
4. zup lug walm wif walm -> yellow blue blue blue red red red
5. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow

From the first input/output pair, ""walm"" yields three instances of red and one green after ""wif"".
In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""lug"" and ""wif"", resulting in three yellows, one blue, and two reds.
In the third example, when ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, it produces three blues.
In the fourth example, ""walm"" occurs twice, each time giving rise to extra reds in the sequence.
In the fifth example, ""walm"" is solely preceded by ""zup"" and it yields three yellows.

From this analysis, the rule associated with ""walm"" seems to be that it generates outputs that repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"". Whereas the standalone occurrence of ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in three of the color that would correspond to ""zup"".

Therefore, the tentative rule is:
Rule: walm -> ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word that directly precedes it; if ""walm"" is the only word following ""zup"", it generates three instances of the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,94
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"".

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue"".
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color green regardless of its position in a sequence.
Based on the examples provided:

- Whenever the word ""wif"" appears alone, the output is ""red"".
- In sentences where ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is also ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output for ""dax"" is ""green,"" but the output for ""wif"" remains ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""zup,"" the output for ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

From these observations, the most consistent rule is that the word ""wif"" correlates to the color ""red"" in the output, irrespective of the context. 

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that each unique word has a corresponding color. The word ""zup"" consistently results in the word ""yellow"" regardless of the context or position in the input. Other words shown (wif, walm, and lug) consistently result in ""red"", ""red"", and ""blue"" respectively. Therefore, the rule that could be inferred is as follows:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" maps to the color ""yellow.""
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we can compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs to look for patterns. Here are the inputs and outputs pairing each word with its translated color:

1. wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> red green red red yellow red
2. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red
3. dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> green blue yellow red red green
4. lug zup bluf dax -> blue yellow yellow green
5. wif bluf dax -> red red green

First, let's identify clear patterns for the known words:
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- ""walm"" is a new word, but its consistent translation is ""green,"" the same as ""dax.""

Now, considering the occurrences of ""bluf"":
- In the 1st input, ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup"" (yellow), and ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""
- In the 2nd input, ""bluf"" is at the end and is translated as two ""red""s.
- In the 3rd input, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" (green), and ""bluf"" translates to two ""red""s.
- In the 4th input, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" (green), and ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""
- In the 5th input, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" (green), and ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""

To find the rule for ""bluf,"" let's note the pattern when ""bluf"" is followed by a word other than ""wif"" (red), the color right after ""bluf"" seems to be the color of the word that follows it. However, when ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" (red), the output is just ""red.""

Considering this pattern, let's conjecture a rule:
""bluf"" translates to ""red,"" but when followed by a word, it also repeats that following word's color.

Let's apply this rule to our inputs:
- 1st input: ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup"" (yellow), so it should be ""red yellow,"" but we only see ""red."" This could be because ""red"" is repeated as it is the color of ""wif,"" which precedes ""bluf.""
- 2nd input: ""bluf"" is at the end and translates to two ""red""s, this fits our rule if we consider a default behavior of ""bluf"" repeating its own color if not followed by another word.
- 3rd input: ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" (green), so it's ""red green,"" fitting the rule.
- 4th input: ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" (green), but translates to ""yellow,"" which does not fit the rule. However, this example could be the result of an error.
- 5th input: ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" (green), so it's ""red green,"" fitting the rule.

Taking into account the potential error in the 4th input, the conjectured rule seems to be mostly consistent with the examples provided:

Rule: When ""bluf"" is followed by a word, it translates to ""red"" and also takes on the color of the word that follows it. If ""bluf"" is not followed by a word or is followed by ""wif"" (red), it only translates to ""red.""

Therefore, based on the examples provided, with an assumption of a transcription error in one of them, the rule for ""bluf"" can be summarized as:

bluf -> red (and potentially repeats the color of the word that follows it, except when followed by ""wif"" where it remains red).
From the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning or use of the word ""walm"" based on its correlation with the output.

1. ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to blue, it results in additional ""blue"" outputs.

2. ""lug walm dax"" translates to ""blue blue blue green."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" again and, just like before, generates additional ""blue"" outputs before ""dax"" changes the sequence to green.

3. & 4. Both ""dax walm"" examples translate to ""green green green."" This suggests that ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in repeated ""green"" outputs.

5. ""lug walm wif zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue red yellow red."" After ""lug"", ""walm"" again generates repeated ""blue"", and then the pattern changes with the introduction of new words.

From these observations, we can gather that ""walm"" seems to repeat the color output of the word that precedes it. In cases where ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it results in additional ""blue"" outputs; when it follows ""dax,"" it results in additional ""green"" outputs.

Rule: walm -> a function that repeats the color output of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, I will analyze each one and deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"":

1. Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
   Output: yellow red red yellow blue
   Here ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" that appears at the end.

2. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   Every ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", which occurs both at the beginning and end and also in between other colors.

3. Input: lug zup wif
   Output: blue yellow red
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", which is the first color in the sequence.

4. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", which is the second color after ""red"" represented by ""wif"".

5. Input: lug zup wif lug
   Output: blue yellow red blue
   Both occurrences of ""lug"" correspond to ""blue"" at the beginning and end of the sequence.

Rule: lug -> blue

Every instance of the nonce word ""lug"" across all examples corresponds to the color ""blue"".
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the sequence. Other words correspond to different colors as well, but ""dax"" consistently leads to ""green"" in the output. Therefore, the meaning behind ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

dax -> meaning. Meaning: ""dax"" means green.

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
Based on the provided examples, every instance of ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. 

Here is the evidence that supports this rule:

- Input ""wif"" corresponds to an output of ""red.""
- Input ""zup wif"" corresponds to an output of ""yellow red,"" suggesting that ""zup"" may mean ""yellow"" and ""wif"" means ""red.""
- The third instance of ""wif"" again results in an output of ""red,"" which reaffirms the initial observation.
- In the input ""dax walm wif zup,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the output, and is preceded by ""green green green"", which suggests ""dax walm"" means ""green green"" and ""zup"" still means ""yellow"".
- Lastly, the input ""lug wif dax"" corresponds to an output of ""blue red green,"" which means ""lug"" might mean ""blue,"" ""wif"" again means ""red,"" and ""dax"" means ""green"".

This consistency across all examples suggests that ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
bluf -> the color corresponding to the previous word said twice. Rule:

- In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" after ""lug"" gives two ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" after ""zup"" gives two ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""bluf"" after ""wif"" gives two ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red,"" so it outputs two ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" so it outputs two ""blue.""
From the examples given, we can infer the following:

1. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"". Given that ""dax"" appears both in the input and the output, it implies that ""dax"" might correspond to ""green"" and that ""walm"" is a repetition of the preceding color.

2. ""zup dax lug walm zup"" becomes ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow"". ""zup"" apparently translates to ""yellow"", ""dax"" as established is ""green"", and ""lug"" seems to translate to ""blue"". ""walm"" in this sequence repeats the color ""blue"" twice, suggesting that ""walm"" functions as a repeat of the color directly before it.

3. ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" transforms into ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow"". Here, ""wif"" is translated to ""red"", preserving previous associations for ""zup"" (yellow), ""lug"" (blue), and ""dax"" (green). ""walm"" here repeats ""yellow"" thrice, which follows the rule deduced from the previous examples, as ""zup"" appears three times before ""walm"".

4. ""dax walm wif"" turns into ""green green green red"". Here ""walm"" repeats ""green"" two times, and then ""wif"" is ""red"".

5. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" becomes ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red"". ""lug"" is ""blue"", so ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" two times, ""zup"" is ""yellow"", and ""wif"" is ""red"".

Based on these examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: **walm -> Repeat of the immediately preceding color word the same number of times as the preceding color word has appeared in the sequence up to that point.**

For example, ""dax walm"" repeats ""green"" two times because ""dax"" (green) has appeared once before ""walm"". In ""zup dax lug walm zup"", ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" two times following one instance of ""lug"". However, in ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"", ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times because ""zup"" (yellow) has appeared three times before ""walm"".

    Rules:

- lug wif zup wif -> blue red yellow red (lug corresponds to blue)
- dax zup lug bluf -> green yellow blue blue (lug corresponds to blue)
- dax walm zup lug walm -> green green green yellow blue blue blue (lug corresponds to blue)
- dax wif walm lug zup -> green red red red blue yellow (lug corresponds to blue)
- zup dax lug wif dax -> yellow green blue red green (lug corresponds to blue)

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in each example provided.
From the examples given, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" In each instance, when ""wif"" is presented in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Below are the extrapolations from the given examples:

- In the first example, ""lug wif lug"" corresponds to ""blue red blue,"" with ""wif"" in the middle taking the place of ""red.""
- In the second example, ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red."" The last word in the input is ""wif,"" which corresponds to the last word ""red"" in the output.
- In the third example, ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" becomes ""green green red yellow red."" Here, ""wif"" appears twice and each time corresponds to ""red"" in the output.
- In the fourth example, ""dax wif lug"" translates to ""green red blue."" ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif bluf lug zup"" has the output ""red red blue yellow."" The first word ""wif"" corresponds to the first word in the output, ""red.""

Rule:
wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the relationship between the inputs and their outputs:

1. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
2. ""dax bluf zup"" -> ""green green yellow""
3. ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red""
4. ""dax lug wif bluf"" -> ""green blue red red""
5. ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" -> ""red green red red yellow red""

In each output, the word ""bluf"" results in the duplication of the color of the word that directly precedes it:

1. ""zup"" (yellow) is followed by ""bluf,"" so the output is ""yellow yellow.""
2. ""dax"" (green) is followed by ""bluf,"" so the output is ""green green"" and then followed by ""zup"" (yellow).
3. ""wif"" (red) is followed by ""bluf,"" so the output is ""red red.""
4. ""wif"" (red) is preceded by ""bluf,"" so the output again includes ""red red.""
5. ""wif"" (red) precedes ""bluf,"" so the output has ""red red"" in the position following ""dax.""

Based on this consistency across examples, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it duplicates the output color of the word that comes directly before it in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""bluf"" means to duplicate the color associated with the preceding word in the output.
Based on the examples provided where ""walm"" is used in various sequences, we observe the following:

1. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow""
   When ""walm"" appears after ""zup,"" the color ""yellow"" is repeated thrice.

2. ""lug dax walm wif"" -> ""blue green green green red""
   After ""dax,"" the color ""green"" appears three times due to the presence of ""walm.""

3. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
   Again, the occurrence of ""walm"" after ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"" being repeated thrice.

4. ""zup wif dax walm"" -> ""yellow red green green green""
   ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" resulting in the repetition of ""green"" thrice.

5. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" -> ""green green green yellow blue blue blue""
   The pattern repeats as earlier—the word ""walm"" following ""dax"" results in ""green"" repeated thrice and following ""lug"" leads to ""blue"" repeated thrice.

Based on this analysis, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times. The color to be repeated is determined by the word immediately before ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color word to repeat three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" matches the color ""green"" every time it appears. The colors that correspond to ""zup"" and ""lug walm"" are consistent as well, with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"" and ""lug walm"" corresponding to ""blue blue blue blue."" It appears that the word ""dax"" translates directly and consistently to ""green"" regardless of its position in the input.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red

Every time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the output includes the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in each instance it appears.
bluf -> green

Rule: The word ""bluf"" represents the color ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, we can observe the following pattern:

- The word that comes before ""walm"" dictates the number of times the color that represents it will appear in the output. 
- The word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"".
- The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"".
- The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"".
- The word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"".

Applying this pattern to the examples:

1. ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"", indicating that ""walm"" causes the color represented by ""wif"" (red) to be repeated three times.
2. ""lug wif walm"" leads to ""blue red red red"", so ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times, following ""lug"" which translates to ""blue"".
3. ""dax zup walm wif"" turns into ""green yellow yellow yellow red"". Here, ""walm"" precedes ""wif"" and causes ""yellow"", represented by ""zup,"" to repeat three times before the single ""red"".
4. ""zup dax walm lug wif"" becomes ""yellow green green green blue red"". In this case, ""walm"" precedes ""lug"" and causes ""green"", represented by ""dax,"" to appear three times before ""blue"" and ""red"".
5. ""lug walm wif lug"" leads to ""blue blue blue red blue"". Here, ""walm"" is before ""wif"", which causes the color ""blue"" to be repeated three times before ""red"" and then followed by a single ""blue"" at the end.

Rule: The word ""walm"" when followed by a color word causes the color represented by that word to be repeated three times in the output.

walm -> meaning: ""Repeat the color represented by the following word three times.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Whenever the word ""lug"" is present in the input, the word ""blue"" should be included in the corresponding position in the output.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the consistent mapping from the example inputs to the outputs, we can deduce that the word ""dax"" invariably translates to the color ""green.""
Rule: wif -> a rule that changes the color associated with the preceding word.

Based on the examples, the word ""wif"" has an effect on the preceding word. Every time ""wif"" is used after a word, the color output for that word is changed. For instance, ""zup"" alone does not have a defined color, but ""zup wif"" results in ""yellow red."" Similarly, ""dax walm wif"" includes ""walm"" which is consistently associated with the color green, but the use of ""wif"" causes an extra ""red"" to be added to the output.

Using the given examples, we see the following patterns:

- ""zup wif"" results in ""yellow red""; however, without another instance of ""zup"" without ""wif"" to compare, the specific change caused by ""wif"" remains uncertain.
- ""dax walm wif"" results in ""green green green red""; without ""wif,"" ""dax"" is unknown, but ""walm"" results in ""green"", and the presence of ""wif"" adds a ""red"".
- ""lug walm wif"" outputs ""blue blue blue red""; ""lug"" does not have another instance to compare, but ""walm wif"" consistently ends with a ""red"", suggesting ""wif"" introduces this color into the pattern.
- ""zup wif dax wif"" results in ""yellow red green red red""; we see that ""zup wif"" begins with ""yellow red"" as before, and ""dax wif"" brings in ""green red"". The presence of ""wif"" after ""dax"" adds a ""red"" just as it does with ""walm"".

Thus, ""wif"" appears to change the color output, either by introducing a ""red"" or altering the color sequence in a way that includes ""red"". However, without more context or examples that isolate the word ""wif"" or the words that precede it, we cannot determine a more precise rule that ""wif"" follows. It's possible that ""wif"" triggers the addition of ""red"" after the color patterns of certain words, but more data would be needed to confirm this hypothesis.
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""zup"" translates a color word to the color immediately following it in the sequence of traffic lights, which generally goes red -> green -> yellow. Here's the breakdown:

1. ""wif dax zup"" translates to ""red green yellow"", so ""zup"" makes ""dax"" (green) turn into ""yellow"".
2. ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" translates to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"", so ""zup"" makes ""wif"" (red) turn into ""yellow"".
3. ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"", so ""zup"" alone defaults to ""yellow"".
4. ""zup dax bluf"" translates to ""yellow green green"", so ""zup"" before ""dax"" (green) results in ""yellow"".
5. ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow"", so ""zup"" after ""lug"" (blue) results in ""yellow"".

From this, we can deduce that ""zup"" follows this rule:
zup -> when following a color, it changes that color to ""yellow"". If it does not follow a color, it defaults to ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow (either following a color word, turning it to yellow, or alone by default).
bluf -> blue

Rule: The word ""bluf"" represents the color blue in each example, as it consistently correlates with ""blue"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the correlation between the input where ""walm"" appears and the output given:

1. When ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"" (Input: zup walm), the output is a repetition of the color ""yellow"" for each occurrence of ""zup"" prior to ""walm"" (Output: yellow yellow yellow).

2. While ""lug"" preceding ""walm"" (Input: lug walm), results in the color ""blue"" repeated for each instance of ""lug"" before ""walm"" (Output: blue blue blue).

3. In the presence of ""dax"" after ""walm"", such as ""zup walm dax lug"", the color sequence includes ""green"" after the repetition for ""zup"" and before the color for ""lug"" (Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue).

4. Lastly, with various words before and after ""walm"", such as ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"", the sequence repeats the color for each instance of ""zup"" before the ""walm"" and then continues with the colors corresponding to the words following ""walm"" (Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red).

Based on these examples, ""walm"" seems to act as a modifier that creates a repetition effect for the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, for as many occurrences of that word before ""walm"". If followed by another word, ""walm"" doesn't affect the output for the following words.

Rule: walm -> causes the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word to be repeated for each occurrence of that word before ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm zup
    ",Output: blue blue blue yellow,blue blue blue yellow,True,99
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the provided examples. Whenever ""lug"" appears as an input, the corresponding output is ""blue"".
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at the relationship between the inputs and the outputs in the given examples.

- When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm zup,"" the output is ""green green green yellow.""  
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output is ""green blue.""  
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green.""  
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output is ""red green.""  
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""zup,"" the output is ""green yellow.""

From these examples, we can observe that every time ""dax"" appears, the first color in the output is ""green."" The ""green"" output is consistent regardless of what follows ""dax,"" whether it's another nonce word or not.

- ""walm"" correlates with multiple ""green"" outputs, suggesting that it may also represent ""green.""
- ""zup"" when used after ""dax,"" results in ""yellow,"" suggesting that ""zup"" itself represents ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" only appears once, followed by ""blue,"" so it might represent ""blue.""
- ""wif,"" when preceding ""dax,"" results in ""red green."" Since we already associate ""dax"" with ""green,"" we can infer that ""wif"" represents ""red.""

Based on these observations, the color outputs seem to be associated with the nonce words as follows:

- ""dax"" -> green
- ""walm"" -> green (repeated as many times as the word appears)
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""wif"" -> red

Therefore, the rule that can be induced for the meaning of ""dax"" is:

Rule: ""dax"" represents the color ""green"" in the outputs.
Based on the examples provided:

1. The first example associates ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" and ""walm"" with ""red"" (repeated multiple times, likely because ""walm"" is also repeated).

2. The second example maintains the associations of ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" ""walm"" with ""red,"" and adds ""lug"" with ""blue.""

3. The third example seems to flip the associations due to the order, where ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"" and ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and might be influencing the color assigned to ""walm.""

4. The fourth example pairs ""lug"" with ""blue,"" ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" with ""green,"" and puts ""wif"" at the end with ""red.""

5. The fifth example shows ""wif"" at the beginning, still resulting in ""red,"" while ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

Based on the examples, the rule seems to be:
- ""wif"" directly corresponds to the color ""red.""
- The presence of ""wif"" does not change the associated colors of other words when it follows them, but when it precedes ""walm,"" it causes ""walm"" to also be associated with ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the input to output relationship in the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""

Thus, the rule is:
zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" directly translates to the word ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup,"" to ""red"" when followed by ""dax lug,"" and to ""blue"" when it follows ""lug."" Analyzing the examples:

1. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
2. zup bluf -> yellow yellow (repeating the first example)
3. wif bluf dax lug -> red red green blue
4. lug bluf zup -> blue blue yellow
5. lug dax bluf zup lug wif -> blue green green yellow blue red

From the third and fifth examples, we can see that the presence of the word ""dax"" after ""bluf"" changes the output color for ""bluf"" to neither yellow, blue, nor red. In the third example, ""bluf"" is red and in the fifth example it is green, but the fifth example does not follow the rule perfectly since ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" rather than follows it, which suggests there might be additional rules for the placement of ""dax"" relative to ""bluf.""

Given that there is ambiguity and insufficient data to determine the exact rule for ""bluf"" when ""dax"" is involved, and given that ""bluf"" returns consistent colors when in proximity to ""zup"" or ""lug,"" we will ignore the potential variability caused by ""dax"" and focus on the consistent examples.

Therefore, the most consistent rules that we can deduce are as follows:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it translates to ""yellow.""
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" it translates to ""blue.""

This suggests that ""bluf""'s meaning may be context-dependent, with its translation relying on the preceding word. Given we don't have enough consistent information when ""bluf"" is around ""dax"" or ""wif,"" we will not introduce a general rule for those instances.

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the meaning of ""yellow"" after ""zup"" and ""blue"" after ""lug.""
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Each instance of ""walm"" leads to the preceding color being output multiple times. Here's the analysis for each example:

1. ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"" since ""wif"" means red.
2. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"" since ""dax"" means green.
3. ""wif walm"" again translates to ""red red red"", consistent with the previous examples.
4. ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"" since ""lug"" translates to blue.
5. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"", inline with the second input example.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Input: wif lug zup bluf wif bluf
    ",Output: red blue yellow blue red blue,red blue yellow yellow red red,False,100
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> repeats the color associated with the following word.

Rule:
- When the word ""lug"" precedes another word, the color associated with the following word is repeated once. For example, ""lug wif"" results in ""blue red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and therefore ""blue"" precedes ""red"" to indicate repetition. Similarly, ""lug walm zup walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow"" where ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" hence ""blue blue blue"" precedes the set of ""yellow"" to show the triplet repetition.
It appears that ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green,"" regardless of its position within a sequence or the presence of other words. Therefore, the rule seems straightforward:

Rule: dax -> green

This means that whenever the input contains the word ""dax,"" the output will include the color ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the context.
Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to have a pattern in which it takes on the same color as the word that immediately precedes it. Let's verify this by examining each instance where ""bluf"" appears in the given example inputs and respective outputs:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and ""lug,"" which correspond to ""yellow"" and ""blue,"" respectively. In both cases, ""bluf"" takes on the same color as the preceding word: ""yellow"" after ""zup"" and ""blue"" after ""lug.""
- In the second and third examples, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which translates to ""red."" Both times, ""bluf"" is also ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" is again ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" and ""bluf"" is likewise ""green.""

No counterexamples are present in the data provided that contradict this rule. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it represents the same color as the word that comes directly before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the same color as the preceding word.
Based on the given examples, one can observe a pattern regarding the repetition and position of the nonce word ""walm"" and how it corresponds to the colored outputs. Here's what is noticeable:

1. ""walm"" generates a sequence of ""red.""
2. The sequence length appears to be tied to the number of words that precede ""walm"" in the input.
3. Other words, such as ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax,"" correspond to individual colors ""red,"" ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" and ""green,"" respectively.
4. Each time ""walm"" appears, it has one additional ""red"" beyond the count of the individual word ""wif.""

Let's apply these observations to each input and output to find the rule:

- ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red"" suggests ""walm"" generates two ""red"" plus an additional ""red"" for the preceding ""wif.""

- ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""green red yellow yellow red red red"" indicates ""walm"" at the end generates three ""red"" plus an extra ""red"" for the preceding ""wif.""

- ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif"" -> ""blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red"" shows that for the first ""walm,"" it generates three ""red"" (here represented as ""blue"" because it is immediately preceded by ""lug,"" which changes to ""blue""), and for the second ""walm,"" it generates two ""red"" plus the one for the preceding ""wif.""

- ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow"" confirms that ""walm"" following a single ""wif"" results in two consecutive ""red"" plus one more for the ""wif.""

- ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green green green red"" shows ""walm"" generates two ""red,"" but in this case, the sequence is of ""green,"" suggesting that ""walm"" takes the color of the word just before it and applies the one-plus rule.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it generates a series of colors repeating the color coded by the previous word, with the number of repetitions equal to the total number of words preceding ""walm"" plus one for the immediate preceding word, if it is ""wif.""

Assuming these patterns, the rule could be defined as:
Rule: ""walm"" generates a series of color outputs that match the color corresponding to the word immediately before it in the sequence, and the number of outputs is one more than the number of words that precede ""walm,"" with an additional count if the immediate preceding word is ""wif.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in each example provided.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" could be that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" followed by the color that corresponds to the next word in the sequence. If there's no word following ""zup,"" then ""zup"" is last and it only translates to ""yellow.""

Let's analyze each input and corresponding output:

In the first input, ""zup wif"" leads to ""yellow red,"" which suggests that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" here and ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

In the second input, ""zup wif walm"" leads to ""yellow red red red."" The ""wif"" remains ""red,"" and ""walm"" appears to translate to ""red red,"" augmenting the output by two additional ""red"" after the ""yellow"" for ""zup.""

In the third input, ""lug walm zup lug zup wif,"" we have a sequence of ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red."" The ""lug"" is consistently ""blue,"" ""walm"" again seems to be ""red red,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow"" followed by the color of the next word, which is ""blue"" for ""lug"" and ""red"" for ""wif.""

In the fourth input, ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif,"" we get ""blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red."" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""walm"" appears to translate to a repetition of the prior color, which in this case is ""blue."" ""Zup"" here translates to ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" where ""yellow"" precedes three instances of ""yellow"" due to the ""walm"" that follows, and then ""red,"" as ""wif"" follows.

In the last input, ""dax walm zup lug,"" we get ""green green green yellow blue."" ""Dax"" seems to be ""green,"" and ""zup"" follows the rule of being ""yellow"" followed by the color of the next word, which is ""blue.""

Rule:
zup -> ""yellow"" followed by the color corresponding to the next word in the sequence. If ""zup"" is the last word in the sequence, it translates only to ""yellow.""
Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the color ""yellow"".
walm -> repeats the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: When 'walm' follows a word that has a color association, it repeats that color three times. If another non-'walm' word follows, the output transitions to the color associated with that word. 

For example:
- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"" because 'zup' is associated with yellow.
- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"" because 'lug' is associated with blue.
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"" because 'dax' is associated with green.
- ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red"" because 'wif' is associated with red.
- ""zup walm dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green"" because 'zup' is associated with yellow, followed by 'walm' which repeats the yellow three times, then 'dax' changes the sequence to its associated color, green.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in the outputs.
Based on the examples provided, the following observations can be made:

1. The position of ""dax"" in the sequence does not affect the output color; it is always associated with the same color.
2. Other words like ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" ""lug,"" and ""zup"" are consistently associated with the same output colors in every example.

Given these observations, we can deduce that ""dax"" corresponds directly to a color. Each of the other words in the input (""wif,"" ""bluf,"" ""lug,"" ""zup"") are also consistently associated with colors (""red,"" ""red,"" ""blue,"" ""yellow"" respectively).

As such, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" seems to be:

dax -> green 

Rule: Each nonce word maps directly to a specific color in the output. ""Dax"" consistently maps to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each nonce word corresponds to a color:

- ""wif"" always results in ""red.""
- ""zup"" always results in ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" always results in ""blue.""
- ""dax"" always results in ""green.""
- ""bluf"" always results in ""green.""

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to a repetition of the color word that follows it, except in the case where ""zup"" appears at the end or standalone, where it is interpreted as the single color ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule for the word ""zup"" seems to be as follows:

When ""zup"" precedes a color word, the output is the color of that word repeated. When ""zup"" is at the end or appears on its own, the output is yellow.

Rule:
zup -> When followed by a color word, output that color twice. When standalone or at the end, output yellow.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to examine it in the context provided by the inputs and their respective outputs. Here are observations based on the examples:

- The word ""zup"" consistently results in the output ""yellow."" This indicates that ""zup"" probably means ""yellow.""

- The word ""dax"" results in the output ""green"" when it precedes ""bluf"" (example 1) and when combined with ""wif"" before ""bluf"" (example 4). This suggests that ""dax"" means ""green.""

- The word ""wif"" seems to result in the output ""red"" both when it precedes ""bluf"" (example 3) and when it follows ""bluf"" (example 5). This indicates that ""wif"" means ""red.""

Now let's look at ""bluf"":

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and ""dax"" (example 1), the output is ""green green."" Since ""dax"" means ""green,"" and ""zup"" is followed by a ""green"" in this case, ""bluf"" seemingly takes the previous color (""green"" in this case) and repeats it.

2. When ""bluf"" directly follows ""zup"" (example 2), the output is ""yellow yellow."" This supports the idea that ""bluf"" repeats the previous color since ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

3. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and follows ""zup"" (example 3), the output is ""red red."" Again, ""bluf"" takes the color from ""wif"" (""red"") and repeats it.

4. Similarly, in example 4, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and ""dax"" and the output is ""red red."" This fits the rule since ""wif"" means ""red.""

5. Finally, in example 5, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" after ""zup,"" resulting in ""red red yellow."" As before, ""bluf"" takes the color from ""wif"" and repeats it, then ""zup"" outputs ""yellow.""

Based on the observed pattern, we can reasonably conclude that ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. 

Rule: bluf -> causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.
Based on the examples provided, walm appears to dictate the output color to be used for the following words until a new color is denoted by another word. Here's the breakdown:

- ""wif zup walm dax zup"" results in ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow"". After ""walm"" is stated, ""dax"" and subsequent ""zup"" are yellow until ""zup"" changes the color to green for the last ""zup"".
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"". ""Dax"" is green and the following word(s) are green as well because of ""walm"".
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"". ""Zup"" is yellow and the following word(s) are yellow as dictated by ""walm"".
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"". ""Lug"" is blue and the following word(s) remain blue due to ""walm"".
- ""wif walm dax"" results in ""red red red green"". ""Wif"" is red and ""walm"" causes ""dax"" to be red instead of its default green.

Rule: walm -> makes the following words repeat the color of the word just before ""walm"" until a new color is indicated.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup dax zup
    ",Output: red yellow green yellow,red yellow green yellow,True,103
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in every example provided.
Based on the provided examples, each nonce word translates to a specific color. The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in every instance it appears. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" by looking at its position relative to other words and the corresponding outputs.

Here's what we know from each example:

1. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue

2. Input: zup
   Output: yellow

3. Input: lug dax zup lug wif
   Output: blue green yellow blue red

4. Input: wif dax zup dax
   Output: red green yellow green

5. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

From these examples, it seems that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Other words like ""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" and ""dax"" appear to correspond to different colors (""lug"" to blue, ""walm"" also to blue, ""wif"" to red, and ""dax"" to green) but ""zup"" remains consistently associated with the color yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Reviewing the examples provided:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf dax lug"" translates to ""red red green blue"". 
- In the second example, ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red"".
- In the third example, ""zup bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow red"".
- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"".
- In the fifth example, ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue"".

Analyzing the patterns, it seems clear that ""bluf"" is consistently translated to ""red"" except in the situations where it is the last word in the sequence, where it translates to ""blue."" There is no example where ""bluf"" is both the first and last word; thus, the pattern is inferred based on its position in the sequence and not its repetition count or any preceding colors.

Rule: bluf -> ""red"" when it is not the last word in the sequence, ""blue"" when it is the last word in the sequence.
From the examples provided, we can induce the following rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

- Each occurrence of ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word three times. 

Let's analyze the examples to corroborate this:

1. In ""lug walm wif"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times. Then ""wif"" corresponds to red. Hence we get ""blue blue blue red.""

2. In ""dax lug dax lug walm,"" we first see the pattern ""green blue green blue,"" and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated two more times to give ""green blue green blue blue blue.""

3. In ""wif walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated two more times, giving us ""red red red.""

4. In ""dax walm zup lug walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after the first ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated two more times. Then ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to blue, and after the second ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated two more times, resulting in ""green green green yellow blue blue blue.""

5. In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated two more times, giving us ""yellow yellow yellow.""

So, walm -> Repeats the color of the previous word three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, output the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif bluf
    ",Output: green red red,green red red,True,104
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Here is the induction from the examples:

1. Input: ""dax"" results in Output: ""green""
2. Input containing ""dax"" among other words also results in an Output where ""dax"" is translated to ""green"" while other words are translated to different colors.

Thus, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green. The meaning of ""dax"" is the color green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" is consistently translated to the color red in all given examples.
Based on the provided examples, we can observe the following pattern:

- Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output.

This pattern is consistent across all examples given. It does not depend on the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence or on the presence or absence of other words.

Therefore, the rule we can induce is:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
Rule: bluf -> repeats the color associated with the word preceding it.

Supporting Evidence:

1. When 'zup' precedes 'bluf', the output is 'yellow yellow', suggesting 'bluf' takes the color of 'zup', which is 'yellow'.
2. When 'lug' precedes 'bluf', the output is 'blue blue', which indicates 'bluf' adopts 'lug's color, which is 'blue'.
3. When 'dax' precedes 'bluf', there is no direct output for 'bluf', but following the pattern, if 'dax' meant 'green', 'bluf' would have continued the pattern with 'green' again if it were isolated with 'dax'. The sequence 'wif zup dax' with outputs 'red yellow green' is unrelated to 'bluf', which aligns with the earlier instances of 'bluf' repeating the previous word's color.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns concerning the appearance of ""walm"" in the input string and the respective colors in the output string.

Input: zup dax walm lug wif
Output: yellow green green green blue red
- ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" (green) and then ""wif"" (red).

Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
- ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" (green) and another ""zup"" (yellow).

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
- ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" (green).

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
- ""walm"" appears at the end, preceded by ""dax"" (green).

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
- ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue).

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the following word to take the color of the word immediately preceding ""walm."" If ""walm"" is the last word in a sequence, it takes the color of the word preceding it. There's no example with ""walm"" in the beginning position, so we can't deduce the rule for that scenario.

Rule: walm -> The word following ""walm"" (or ""walm"" itself if it is the last word) takes the color of the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow,yellow yellow yellow,True,105
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" in the input corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at the position of the word 'dax' in each sentence and the corresponding output color.

In the first example:
- ""dax walm wif dax"" corresponds to ""green green green red green.""

In the second example:
- ""wif bluf dax lug"" corresponds to ""red red green blue.""

In the third example:
- ""zup bluf dax lug"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow green blue.""

In the fourth example:
- ""wif lug dax lug"" corresponds to ""red blue green blue.""

In the fifth example:
- ""lug zup dax lug dax"" corresponds to ""blue yellow green blue green.""

Based on these examples, every time the word 'dax' appears, the output is 'green,' except when 'dax' appears at the very end of the input sequence, in which case the output is 'red.'

So the rule appears to be:

dax -> green when not at the end of a sequence.
dax -> red when at the end of a sequence.

Rule: If 'dax' is followed by another word, its corresponding color is green. If 'dax' is the last word in the sequence, its corresponding color is red.
Using the given examples, we can attempt to induce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""wif"". Examining each instance:

1. Whenever ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red"".
2. ""wif"" does not appear to affect the colors associated with the other words (e.g., ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow"", ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green"").
3. When ""wif"" appears alone, the output is a single ""red"".

Based on these observations, the rule can be summarized as:

wif -> ""red"". The presence of ""wif"" in the input always corresponds to ""red"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it looks as if ""zup"" consistently correlates to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Each time the word ""zup"" is included in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
Given the examples:

- zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
- wif bluf dax lug -> red red green blue
- wif lug zup bluf -> red blue yellow yellow
- wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
- zup lug bluf -> yellow blue blue

The rule appears to be that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence. This is clear from the color sequence of the output always matching with the color of the word that comes before ""bluf"".

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" we should look at the consistent patterns in the input-to-output mappings. The outputs are sequences of colors, and each input contains the word ""walm"" along with other words that map to specific colors.

Here are the mappings we can establish from the provided examples:

- ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green.""
- ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red.""
- ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue.""

Now, let's analyze the occurrences of ""walm"" in each input and the corresponding output to find a pattern.

- Example 1 (dax walm lug): ""green green green blue"" - After ""dax,"" which maps to ""green,"" the sequence repeats ""green"" two more times before ""lug,"" which is ""blue."" It suggests ""walm"" may mean repetition of the color of the word before it.
- Example 2 (wif walm zup lug wif walm zup): ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow"" - Here, we see ""red"" repeated three times after ""wif,"" and before ""zup,"" which is ""yellow."" It follows the word ""walm,"" reinforcing the idea that ""walm"" causes a repetition.
- Example 3 (lug zup dax walm): ""blue yellow green green green"" - When ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" we see ""green"" repeated three times. Notice ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is ""green.""
- Example 4 (wif lug walm): ""red blue blue blue"" - ""walm"" after ""lug"" (""blue"") results in ""blue"" being repeated three times.
- Example 5 (dax wif zup bluf wif walm): ""green red yellow yellow red red red"" - After ""wif,"" which maps to ""red,"" we see ""red"" repeated three times followed by a ""walm,"" which fits the repetition pattern.

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to be repeated three times in the output sequence. Hence, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows another word associated with a color, that color is repeated three times in the output.

Therefore, ""walm"" -> meaning: ""Repeat the color of the previous word three times.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,106
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Every time the word 'lug' appears in the input, it corresponds to the word 'blue' in the output, regardless of the context or position in the sequence.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by analyzing its occurrences and the corresponding outputs.

Here are the examples broken down with a focus on ""wif"":

1. wif dax lug walm -> red green blue blue blue
2. zup wif -> yellow red
3. dax wif walm -> green red red red
4. dax lug dax lug wif -> green blue green blue red
5. dax bluf wif zup wif -> green green red yellow red

We can observe the following:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red.""
- The appearance of ""wif"" does not alter the output of subsequent words.
- Other words in the input correspond to their unique colors consistently across multiple examples.

Considering these observations, we can conclude that ""wif"" corresponds directly to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output regardless of its position or the surrounding words.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To determine what ""bluf"" means, let's compare the given inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. dax zup bluf            -> green yellow yellow
2. wif bluf lug zup        -> red red blue yellow
3. dax walm wif bluf       -> green green green red red
4. wif dax wif bluf zup wif-> red green red red yellow red
5. zup lug zup lug zup bluf -> yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow

First, let's notice that all of the inputs have ""bluf"" as the last word before the pattern of colors outputted by the system begins to repeat. This could mean that ""bluf"" signals the end of a unique pattern and the start of a repetition. Let's explore this idea with each input and output sequence:

1. ""dax zup bluf"" yields ""green yellow yellow"". After ""bluf"", the color pattern does not repeat since the sequence ends.
   
2. ""wif bluf lug zup"" yields ""red red blue yellow"". After ""bluf"", ""lug zup"" shows a new sequence ""blue yellow"", but since ""bluf"" is between two ""red"", it might signify a transition point.

3. ""dax walm wif bluf"" yields ""green green green red red"". The sequence ""green green green"" is before ""bluf"" and it is followed by a ""red red"" repetition after ""bluf"".

4. ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" yields ""red green red red yellow red"". Here, ""bluf"" is followed by a repeated sequence ""yellow red"", which was initiated by ""zup wif"" after ""bluf"".

5. ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" yields ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow"". In this sequence, ""yellow"" is repeated after ""bluf"", and before ""bluf"", the pattern ""yellow blue"" was repeating.

Considering the patterns, it appears that ""bluf"" might indicate a point of transition, signaling either the start of a repetition or confirming the end of a unique pattern in the sequence. However, the data is inconclusive because ""bluf"" itself doesn't have a consistent following pattern—sometimes it is followed by a color that was already present in the sequence, and sometimes the sequence ends.

Hence, the rule is not definitive, but it could be something like:

Rule: ""bluf"" signifies the end of a unique color pattern and potentially the beginning of a repetition.
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that `walm` repeats the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule:
- `dax walm` -> `green green green`, which means `walm` repeats the color green associated with `dax`.
- `wif walm dax zup` -> `red red red green yellow`, where `walm` repeats the color red associated with `wif`.
- `lug walm dax` -> `blue blue blue green`, where `walm` repeats the color blue associated with `lug`.
- `wif walm zup lug wif walm zup` -> `red red red yellow blue red red red yellow`, `walm` first repeats red (associated with `wif`), and then again repeats red (associated with the second `wif`).

walm -> meaning is that it repeats the color of the word that comes before it three times.

Rule: When `walm` follows a color-associated word, it produces an output of that color said three times in a row.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,107
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: In each instance, the word ""lug"" corresponded to the color ""blue"" in the output regardless of its position or surrounding context, which indicates that ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
dax -> green

Rule:
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
- Each occurrence of ""dax"" in an input sequence results in the word ""green"" in the output sequence at the same position.
- Other words (e.g., ""walm,"" ""bluf,"" ""zup,"" ""wif"") correspond to different colors in the output sequence (""walm"" responds with multiple greens, ""bluf"" with a yellow, and ""wif"" with a red), but consistently, ""dax"" represents ""green"" regardless of its position or the other words present.
Using the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of ""wif"" by looking at the patterns and the corresponding output colors.

Input: zup lug walm wif dax
Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

Input: lug dax wif
Output: blue green red

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green

Input: wif
Output: red

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red

Looking at the examples, it seems ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" in the output. Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. Thus,

wif -> red. 

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. Each subsequent word corresponds to a color, with ""wif"" being red and ""lug"" being blue. ""Bluf"" might indicate repetition of the previous color, as in the example ""zup bluf wif walm"" the color yellow is repeated before moving on to the next colors. ""Walm"" doesn't change the color but seems to indicate repetition of ""red"" based on the previous examples.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" correlates with a specific color in the output. To deduce its meaning, let's look at each instance where ""bluf"" is present:

Input: dax zup lug zup bluf => Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow
Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm => Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
Input: wif bluf dax => Output: red red green
Input: zup bluf lug zup walm => Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
Input: dax bluf wif => Output: green green red

In each case, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" However, reviewing the instances where ""bluf"" appears, we should notice an inconsistency in the first example; where ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow,"" yet it results in ""blue"" in the output.

Considering the possibility of a typo in the first example, assuming the other four instances provide a consistent pattern, the rule seems to be: bluf -> yellow.

Rule: bluf -> yellow (with a possible exception due to a typo in the first example).
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in how its presence affects the output. Here are the observations:

1. When ""walm"" is present:
   - In Input 1 ""dax zup walm wif"" the output is ""green yellow yellow yellow red"".
   - In Input 2 ""dax walm zup walm"" the output is ""green green green yellow yellow yellow"".
   - In Input 3 ""wif walm zup"" the output is ""red red red yellow"".
   - In Input 4 ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" the output is ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"".
   - In Input 5 ""zup wif walm"" the output is ""yellow red red red"".

2. ""Walm"" is followed by a sequence of yellow output colors, and the number of yellows after ""walm"" corresponds to the number of times ""walm"" occurs in the input. For instance, in Input 1, there is one ""walm"" and three yellows following it. In Input 2, there are two instances of ""walm"" and six yellows following them.

3. Before the occurrence of ""walm,"" the colors in the output do not change from the established pattern (e.g., ""dax"" -> green, ""zup"" -> yellow, ""wif"" -> red). 

From these observations, we can deduce:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the next non-""walm"" word's corresponding output to be repeated until another non-""walm"" word appears.

Therefore:

walm -> the rule stated above.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,108
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples given, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug.""

The word ""lug"" appears consistently in a variety of contexts, but its appearance always results in the output color ""blue."" This is evident because every input that includes ""lug"" (regardless of other words present) generates an output that includes ""blue"" in the corresponding position.

Therefore, we can derive the following simple rule:

lug -> blue

Rule: When ""lug"" is present in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
From the examples provided, we can infer the following relationships between the inputs and their outputs:

Input: dax | Output: green -> dax corresponds to the color green.

Now let's examine the compound inputs:

Input: lug dax | Output: blue green -> This suggests that 'lug' corresponds to the color blue, and 'dax' still corresponds to green.

Input: dax wif | Output: green red -> It appears that 'wif' corresponds to the color red, while 'dax' remains green.

Input: zup walm dax lug | Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue -> This sequence is interesting because we have 'zup walm' preceding 'dax lug'. 'Zup walm' is not separated and corresponds to three yellows in a row, which might suggest 'zup walm' as a repeating pattern of yellow (or that 'zup' and 'walm' each individually correspond to yellow, but there would need to be more data to confirm this). The pattern again concludes with 'dax' as green followed by 'lug' as blue.

Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf | Output: red green yellow red green green -> Based on previous inputs, 'wif' corresponds to red and 'dax' to green. 'zup' has been seen in a sequence before yielding yellow, but it's ambiguous whether it's 'zup' or 'walm' or their combination that gives the yellow color. 'Bluf' is a new element which, in this context, also corresponds to green.

With the provided information, the most consistent rule we can deduce for 'dax' is that it corresponds to the color green:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the outputs provided. Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
Based on the given examples, zup translates to the color yellow. However, it's important to verify the consistency of this rule. In every instance that zup appears, the word yellow is in the corresponding output sequence.

Here is the breakdown by example:

Example 1: ""zup wif lug"" aligns with ""yellow red blue,"" revealing that zup corresponds to yellow, with wif and lug corresponding to red and blue, respectively.

Example 2: ""lug zup"" results in ""blue yellow,"" again indicating that zup corresponds to yellow and lug to blue.

Example 3: ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" produces ""green green red yellow blue."" Here, dax and bluf correspond to green, wif to red, zup to yellow, and lug to blue.

Example 4: ""zup lug"" translates to ""yellow blue,"" consistently identifying zup with yellow and lug with blue.

Example 5: ""dax zup lug wif zup"" maps to ""green yellow blue red yellow."" Following the established translations for dax (green), zup (yellow), lug (blue), and wif (red), the pattern is consistently maintained.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, we can induce that the word ""bluf"" represents the color that is mentioned right before it.

1. For ""lug wif lug bluf,"" we have ""blue red blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" represents blue, and when ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the color blue is repeated.

2. In ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif,"" the output is ""yellow blue red green green red."" We see that ""dax"" represents green and ""bluf"" comes right after ""dax,"" resulting in another green.

3. ""Zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which represents yellow, and we get yellow once more.

4. ""Dax lug wif bluf"" is ""green blue red red."" Following the pattern, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" which represents red, giving us red again.

5. Finally, for ""zup bluf wif dax lug,"" we have ""yellow yellow red green blue."" In this case, ""bluf"" occurs after ""zup,"" which is yellow, thus yielding another yellow.

Rule: bluf -> the color that is mentioned immediately before it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's look at its position relative to other words in the input and the corresponding colors in the output. We will identify patterns before and after the word ""walm"" and see how they correlate with the output colors.

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) and precedes ""wif"" (red).

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) and precedes ""lug"" (blue).

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and is at the end of the sentence, so there's no word after it in the input, but ""walm"" itself is followed by ""blue.""

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
- Here, ""walm"" follows a sequence ""zup lug zup"" (yellow blue yellow) and precedes ""dax wif"" (green red).

Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) and precedes ""lug"" (blue), similar to the second example.

Let's try to ascertain a pattern based on these observations:

- ""walm"" often follows a red or blue output, which could possibly mean that it turns the following word into red if the preceding color is red or blue; it seems to keep or repeat red and blue consistently.
- When ""walm"" precedes a word that has been colored green in a previous example (""dax""), it does not make the following color red; instead, it becomes ""green"" again.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""dax,"" both colors remain yellow and green, respectively.

It appears that ""walm"" has the rule of repeating the color of the word before it, except when it follows the word ""dax,"" which results in a ""green"" rather than a repeat of the previous color.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word, except following ""dax"", which is always green.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow blue,yellow yellow yellow blue,False,109
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> reverse color order. Rule: When ""lug"" appears in an input sequence, it reverses the order of the colors that follow it. The colors prior to ""lug"" remain in the same order. For example: 

- In ""wif lug"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and after ""lug"" comes ""blue"", so ""lug"" causes ""blue"" to come before ""red""; thus, the output is ""red blue"" reversed to ""blue red"".
- When ""wif walm lug bluf"" is given, ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red"", ""lug"" comes next and thus inverts the order of the colors that follow, so ""bluf bluf"" (""blue blue"") is reversed; hence the output ""red red blue blue"" becomes ""red red red blue blue"".
- With ""zup wif lug dax"", ""zup wif"" corresponds to ""yellow red"". ""lug"" reverses the following colors, so ""dax"" which is ""green"" comes before ""blue""; making ""yellow red green blue"" the correct sequence, which is actually ""yellow red blue green"".
- In ""zup bluf wif lug dax"", ""zup bluf wif"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red"". ""lug"" again reverses the following colors, changing ""dax"" which is ""green"" to precede ""blue"", resulting in the sequence ""yellow yellow red green blue"", which becomes ""yellow yellow red blue green"".
Based on the given examples, the rule appears to correlate the nonce word ""dax"" with the color ""green"". Each time the word ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, the color ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
By analyzing the provided examples, we can identify a pattern in the correspondence between input and output:

- Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" is the first word in the output.
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when it comes after ""zup"" but corresponds to ""red"" when it appears without ""zup.""
- ""lug"" always corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""dax"", when present, results in ""green.""

Therefore, we can deduce:

wif -> red

The meaning seems to be consistent across the examples, with ""wif"" always translating to ""red"". 

Rule: Each nonce word in the input maps to a specific color in the output, with ""wif"" mapping to ""red."" The presence of other words may alter the mapping (as seen with ""bluf"") when combined with other words.
Based on the examples provided, we can analyze the occurrences of the nonce word ""zup"" and its corresponding outputs to deduce its meaning:

1. ""dax walm zup walm"" corresponds to ""green green green yellow yellow yellow."" The word ""walm"" that follows ""zup"" is represented by ""yellow,"" repeated three times, while ""dax"" before ""walm"" is represented by ""green,"" repeated three times. 

2. ""zup lug zup wif dax"" corresponds to ""yellow blue yellow red green."" Here, ""zup"" precedes ""lug"" and follows ""wif,"" with each instance of ""zup"" producing a ""yellow."" Meanwhile, ""lug"" itself corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

3. ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" corresponds to ""red yellow yellow red green."" The word ""wif"" represents ""red,"" and we see that ""zup"" again leads to the color ""yellow,"" followed by the color associated with the next word. Since ""bluf"" has not been translated, we can infer ""zup"" causes the repetition of ""yellow"" as it follows ""wif.""

4. ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow."" The presence of ""zup"" before ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" repeated thrice.

5. ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" corresponds to ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue."" The word ""lug"" after ""zup"" generates ""blue"" after ""yellow,"" and the sequence ""zup bluf"" includes two ""yellows"" before the final ""blue.""

From these examples, it seems that the rule for ""zup"" is to repeat the color associated with the following word three times in yellow. If the following word is not known or has no color associated with it, ""yellow"" is repeated once.

Rule: zup -> Repeat the color associated with the following word three times in yellow, or if unknown, once.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""green"" when it follows the words ""wif,"" ""dax,"" or ""zup,"" but it translates to the color ""red"" when it follows the word ""wif"" and precedes the word ""lug."" In cases where ""bluf"" is repeated, it keeps its first assigned color.

From the examples:

1. ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" converts to ""red green yellow red green green,"" where the last word ""bluf"" is following ""dax,"" so it becomes ""green.""
2. ""zup bluf"" converts to ""yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""bluf"" following ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" but since we see from other examples that ""bluf"" is ""green,"" it might be that ""bluf"" is the same color as the word preceding it when it starts a series.
3. ""wif zup dax bluf"" converts to ""red yellow green green,"" where ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and is ""green.""
4. ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" converts to ""green yellow red red blue,"" where ""bluf"" precedes ""lug"" and is ""red.""
5. ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup"" converts to ""yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow,"" where ""bluf"" is ""green"" when it follows ""dax,"" and it maintains the color ""blue"" when it follows ""lug.""

To establish the rule for ""bluf"":

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" ""dax,"" or ""zup,"" it is ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" precedes ""lug,"" it is ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" starts or follows itself, it retains the same color as the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> green (when following ""wif,"" ""dax,"" or ""zup""), bluf -> red (when preceding ""lug""), bluf -> same as preceding color (when at the start or after itself).
To deduce what ""walm"" means, let's analyze the given inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: `zup dax lug walm zup lug`
   Output: `yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue`
   Here, whenever ""zup"" is present it maps to ""yellow"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green"". Following this pattern, ""walm"" seems to map to ""blue"".

2. Input: `zup bluf lug zup walm`
   Output: `yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow`
   Since ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"", it appears that ""walm"" is replaced with ""yellow"" here, but it could also mean ""walm"" duplicates the previous color, which was yellow due to ""zup"".

3. Input: `zup walm lug wif`
   Output: `yellow yellow yellow blue red`
   Here, ""walm"" again follows ""zup"" and gets replaced with ""yellow"". It increases the likelihood that ""walm"" is either ""yellow"" or duplicates the previous color.

4. Input: `wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug`
   Output: `red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue`
   Once more ""walm"" is following ""zup"" which is ""yellow"", and it outputs ""blue"". Since ""lug"" which follows ""walm"" is consistently ""blue"", ""walm"" could again be duplicating the previous color or it could be ""blue"". 

5. Input: `dax walm`
   Output: `green green green`
   Here, there's no preceding word to ""walm"" except ""dax"", which maps to ""green"". So this shows that ""walm"" can map to ""green"" itself, but since we've also seen ""walm"" as ""yellow"", it must not have a fixed color but rather a behavior rule related to context.

To determine the meaning of ""walm"", let's consolidate the observations:

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup"", the color is ""yellow"".
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"", the color is ""blue"".
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the color is ""green"".
- There's also an instance of ""walm"" being followed by ""dax"", and ""walm"" still outputs a ""blue"".

Given all these scenarios, ""walm"" seems not to represent a consistent color but rather a rule to repeat the color output of the word that precedes it. However, in the first input, it's not repeating the color ""green"" from ""dax"", but this could be because the context of two different colors (""dax"" green, ""lug"" blue) led to a default behavior of taking the color from ""lug"". Also, the input of `dax walm` being `green green green` might indicate that when walm stands next to dax specifically, it adopts the color green from dax.

To formulate a general rule based on the provided evidence that handles the inconsistencies:

Rule: ""walm"" -> This word duplicates the color of the word that precedes it, except when paired directly with ""dax,"" where it takes the color green, representative of ""dax"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,110
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently translated as ""blue"" across all examples provided.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the output color is directly related to the input word, with a one-to-one correlation between a specific word and a specific color. From the inputs and outputs provided:

- ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue.""
- ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red.""
- ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green.""
- ""zup"" and ""walm"" both map to ""yellow.""

There is no indication that ""dax"" changes meaning based on context; rather, it consistently corresponds to the same output across all given examples. Therefore:

dax -> ""green.""

Rule: Each nonce word corresponds to a specific color, regardless of its position in the input sequence. ""Dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green.""
Based on the examples provided:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears by itself, the output is ""red"".
- Whenever ""wif"" appears within a sequence, ""red"" is added to the output at the position corresponding to the appearance of ""wif"".

The other words correlate to consistent color outputs as well:
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".
- ""dax"" translates to ""green"".
- ""bluf"" likely translates to ""blue"" given its usage in the same sequence as ""lug"".
- ""walm"" either translates to an unknown color or, given the pattern, to a repetition of the previous word's color. In the sequence ""lug walm,"" ""walm"" outputs ""blue,"" the same as ""lug"". However, in the sequence ""wif walm dax,"" ""walm"" outputs ""red,"" repeating the output ""red"" for ""wif"".
- ""zup"" correlates to the output ""yellow"".

So the term ""wif"" is consistently associated with the output ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: In all the given examples, every instance of the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to mirror the color represented by the word immediately preceding it. To verify this, we can examine each input and corresponding output:

1. Input: ""dax bluf wif zup wif""
   Output: ""green green red yellow red""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", which corresponds to ""green"".

2. Input: ""lug bluf""
   Output: ""blue blue""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", which corresponds to ""blue"".

3. Input: ""dax bluf lug wif""
   Output: ""green green blue red""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", which corresponds to ""green"".

4. Input: ""dax bluf wif lug zup""
   Output: ""green green red blue yellow""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", which corresponds to ""green"".

5. Input: ""lug zup bluf dax""
   Output: ""blue yellow yellow green""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"".

So the rule is:

bluf -> Repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before ""bluf"".

Meaning: ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the preceding word.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repeating output based on the preceding word. Here's how we can figure it out:

- In the first example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red."" Walm follows wif, and the output is thrice red.
- In the second example, ""wif walm dax"" leads to ""red red red green."" Again, walm follows wif and the output is thrice red, and then dax translates to green.
- In the third example, ""wif dax zup walm"" results in ""red green yellow yellow yellow."" Notice that walm is now preceded by zup, and the output is three times yellow.
- In the fourth example, ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow."" Here, walm follows wif and results in thrice red again.
- In the fifth example, ""dax lug walm"" gives ""green blue blue blue."" With walm following lug, it seems to output thrice whatever color lug represents (blue in this case).

Hence, the rule that ""walm"" seems to obey is that it takes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it and repeats it three times. Therefore:

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif bluf zup lug wif
    ",Output: red red yellow blue red,red red yellow blue red,True,111
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's examine the relation between the input and the output. It seems that each word in the input is corresponding to a color in the output. Our goal is to determine what color 'dax' corresponds to.

Looking at the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: ""zup wif dax walm"" | Output: ""yellow red green green green""
2. Input: ""dax"" | Output: ""green""
3. Input: ""zup bluf dax"" | Output: ""yellow yellow green""
4. Input: ""lug dax wif lug"" | Output: ""blue green red blue""
5. Input: ""dax zup walm wif"" | Output: ""green yellow yellow yellow red""

In each output, ""green"" appears every time the word ""dax"" is in the input:

- In the second input, where ""dax"" is the only word, the output is the single color ""green.""
- In all other inputs, whenever ""dax"" appears, the corresponding output includes ""green.""

Based on these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided where the output is always a sequence of colors, it appears that each nonce word maps to a specific color:

- ""zup"" always maps to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" always maps to ""blue""
- ""dax"" always maps to ""green""
- ""walm"" always maps to ""red""

Now, look at the use of ""wif"" in relation to the output:

- Input: ""wif zup"" | Output: ""red yellow"" => ""wif"" is followed by ""zup"" (which maps to ""yellow""), and ""wif"" results in ""red"" being added before ""yellow"".
  
- Input: ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" | Output: ""blue green yellow green green green red"" => In this sequence, ""wif"" comes after ""walm"", and the resulting output ends with ""red"". This is consistent with the individual mappings of ""wif"" to ""red"" and ""walm"" to ""green"".

- Input: ""lug zup wif"" | Output: ""blue yellow red"" => Here, the mapping of ""wif"" is once again to ""red"".

- Input: ""wif walm"" | Output: ""red red red"" => Here, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"", and the output is three ""red""s. Since ""walm"" was already established to map to ""red"", ""wif"" must also map to ""red"" and potentially has a compounding effect of ""red"" being repeated.

- Input: ""dax wif"" | Output: ""green red"" => Again, ""wif"" follows ""dax"" (which maps to ""green"") and leads to the output of ""red"".

From the above, we can conclude the following rule:

Rule: ""wif"" -> ""red""
From the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" by looking for patterns and consistent associations with the given outputs:

1. In the first example, we see that ""lug zup"" corresponds with ""blue yellow"", and considering ""lug walm zup lug zup"" corresponds with ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow"", we can observe that ""zup"" might be associated with the color ""yellow"" since it reliably follows the word ""lug,"" which corresponds with ""blue.""

2. The second example shows ""wif zup bluf"" corresponding with ""red yellow yellow."" Here, the appearance of ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow,"" while ""wif"" becomes ""red"" and ""bluf"" was not previously defined but consistently corresponds to ""yellow.""

3. In the third example, ""zup walm lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue,"" which again shows that ""zup"" could correspond with ""yellow,"" because ""lug"" is the only word previously associated with ""blue.""

4. The fourth example, ""zup lug wif,"" becomes ""yellow blue red,"" supporting earlier observations that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

5. In the fifth example, ""dax wif zup dax"" corresponds with ""green red yellow green."" ""Zup"" is once again associated with ""yellow"" while ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

From these observations, we can deduce that:

Rule: ""zup"" consistently corresponds with the color ""yellow.""
Analyzing the examples:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the output is ""yellow yellow"".
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", the output is ""blue blue"".
3. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output is ""blue blue"".
4. ""bluf"" itself does not seem to correspond to a single color but rather depends on the word that precedes it.

Based on the outputs after the word ""bluf"", it appears that ""bluf"" doubles or repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it. So if ""zup"" is yellow, ""bluf"" after ""zup"" gives another yellow. If ""lug"" is blue, ""bluf"" after ""lug"" gives another blue, and so on.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the word that precedes it.
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it two additional times. For instance, in the second example where ""wif dax walm"" translates to ""red green green green,"" ""walm"" repeats the color ""green"" associated with ""dax"" two more times.

Here are the associated color translations from the examples, which help determine the rule for ""walm"":
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""wif"" -> red

Reviewing the patterns:

- ""lug zup dax walm"" translates to ""blue yellow green green green,"" where ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax"" (green).
- ""zup wif dax walm"" translates to ""yellow red green green green,"" again ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax"" (green).
- ""lug walm dax"" translates to ""blue blue blue green,"" where ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug"" (blue).
- ""dax walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue blue blue,"" where the first ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax"" (green), and the second ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug"" (blue).
- ""dax walm wif walm zup"" translates to ""green green green red red red yellow,"" where the first ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax"" (green) and the second ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif"" (red).

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately before it two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue,"" as shown consistently across all examples.

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the output ""blue.""
Observing the examples provided, we can derive the following outputs for some words:

- 'wif' consistently corresponds to 'red'
- 'zup' consistently corresponds to 'yellow'
- 'lug' corresponds to 'blue' in its single appearance
- 'walm' corresponds to 'yellow' when it is repeated and 'red' when it appears only once

The word 'dax' appears in every input with an output, and each time it correspond to 'green.' There is no variation in this correspondence regardless of the position of 'dax' in the input string or the presence of other words.

Rule: dax -> green. This means 'dax' consistently corresponds to the color 'green'.
Based on the given examples, the rule for the word ""wif"" can be deduced by comparing the inputs and outputs and looking for patterns.

From the first example:
Input: dax lug bluf wif
Output: green blue blue red

From the second example:
Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

From the third example:
Input: lug wif zup wif walm
Output: blue red yellow red red red

From the fourth example:
Input: dax zup dax zup wif
Output: green yellow green yellow red

From the fifth example:
Input: zup wif bluf zup
Output: yellow red red yellow

In every example, the occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output. It doesn't matter where ""wif"" appears in the input sequence; its output is consistently ""red."" Therefore, the rule appears straightforward:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the word ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule seems to be:

zup -> yellow

Rule: When ""zup"" is present in the input, it corresponds to the color yellow in the output.
bluf -> color that is determined by the word preceding it. Rule: lug -> blue, dax -> green, zup -> yellow, wif -> red.
walm -> meaning. Meaning appears to be ""repeat the color corresponding to the previous word."" Rule: Walm causes the output color of the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times. 

- ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""walm"" makes it repeat three times.
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" repeats it three times.
- ""lug walm"" yields ""blue blue blue"" as ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats it three times.
- ""lug zup walm lug"" comes out as ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" here ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"" which repeats ""yellow"" three times, and ""lug"" at the end corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" comes before ""walm,"" leading to ""blue"" being repeated three times, and ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""
Based on the provided examples, we can infer that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output, and the mapping seems consistent across examples. To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's find the color associated with it each time it appears:

1. ""wif zup wif dax"" maps to ""red yellow red green."" Since ""wif"" maps to ""red"" and ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" we can deduce that ""dax"" maps to ""green.""

2. ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" maps to ""blue green yellow green green green red."" Here, ""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" maps to ""red."" ""dax"" is again consistent with mapping to ""green,"" and ""walm"" may be inferred to map to ""green"" as well, since it produces two consecutive ""green"" in the output.

3. ""zup dax"" maps to ""yellow green."" This reinforces the association of ""zup"" with ""yellow"" and ""dax"" with ""green.""

4. ""dax zup lug wif lug"" maps to ""green yellow blue red blue."" The order matches the colors previously associated with each word, with ""dax"" consistently mapping to ""green.""

5. ""wif dax"" maps to ""red green."" This is in line with previous deductions that ""wif"" maps to ""red"" and ""dax"" maps to ""green.""

Based on these observations, the rule for the meaning of the word ""dax"" is consistent across all examples:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each nonce word translates to a specific color. The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""red,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

Given this pattern, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of its position in the sentence.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence or the surrounding words, the output consistently includes ""yellow"" in the position where ""zup"" appeared in the input.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Observing the examples, it seems that 'bluf' repeats the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.

- In the first example, 'zup' translates to 'yellow', and 'bluf' after it also translates to 'yellow'.
- In the second example, 'wif' translates to 'red', and 'bluf' after it also translates to 'red'.
- In the third example, 'zup' is followed by 'bluf' and translates to 'yellow yellow', though 'dax' and 'wif' are also present, they do not directly precede 'bluf' hence aren't repeated.
- In the fourth example, 'zup' precedes 'bluf' and translates to 'yellow yellow'.
- In the fifth example, 'zup' precedes 'bluf' and the pair translates to 'yellow yellow', even though 'wif' and 'lug' are present, 'bluf' only repeats the color of the word directly preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the correspondence between the inputs and outputs in the examples given:

1. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue
2. dax walm zup lug walm -> green green green yellow blue blue blue
3. dax lug dax lug walm -> green blue green blue blue blue
4. wif walm -> red red red
5. lug walm zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow red

Looking at the patterns, it seems that each occurrence of ""walm"" in the input is translated into three instances of the color that precedes it in the output. Here's how this pattern applies to each example:

1. ""wif lug walm"" becomes ""red blue blue blue"" (where ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, and ""walm"" repeats it three times).
2. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" includes two instances of ""walm"": the first ""walm"" repeats the color green three times, and the second repeats the color blue three times.
3. ""dax lug dax lug walm"" results in a final ""walm"" that repeats the color blue three times.
4. ""wif walm"" shows ""walm"" repeating the color red three times, following ""wif"" which is red.
5. ""lug walm zup wif"" has ""walm"" repeating the color blue three times after ""lug.""

Based on this consistent rule throughout the examples, we can deduce:

Rule: ""walm"" -> ""walm"" means repeat the color indicated by the previous word three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup lug
    ",Output: green yellow blue,green yellow blue,True,114
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all given examples, regardless of its position in the sequence.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, we can observe that the output sequence contains colors, with each word from the input being translated into a specific color. For 'dax,' 'lug,' 'zup,' and 'bluf,' the corresponding colors consistently appear to be 'green,' 'blue,' 'yellow,' and 'red,' respectively. However, the word 'wif' always results in the color 'red' preceding another word's corresponding color, regardless of its position in the sentence. 

Therefore, the rule for 'wif' appears to be that it prompts the addition of 'red' before the color that corresponds to the next word in the sequence. 

wif -> Add 'red' before the color corresponding to the next word in the sequence. Rule: When 'wif' appears before a word, put 'red' before the color associated with the next word.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to correspond to a repetitive color sequence in the output. To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can compare the input and output sequences.

- For the first input ""zup dax bluf"", the output is ""yellow green green"". Here, ""bluf"" coincides with a repetition of the color green.
- In the second input ""dax wif bluf"", the output is ""green red red"". Again, ""bluf"" appears to result in a repetition of the color that precedes it, in this case, red.
- The third input ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" has an output of ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". Here, ""bluf"" falls between two instances of blue, further suggesting that it could represent a repetition of the preceding color.
- In the fourth input ""wif zup bluf"", the output is ""red yellow yellow"". Once again, ""bluf"" coincides with the repetition of the preceding color, yellow.
- The fifth input ""wif bluf dax walm"" and its output ""red red green green green"" align with the notion that ""bluf"" is repeating the color before it, as ""bluf"" is associated with the repetition of red.

Analyzing the inputs and their corresponding outputs, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems consistent across all examples:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" means to repeat the color mentioned right before it.
Based on the examples provided where ""walm"" appears and the corresponding output, it can be deduced that ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the following color three times. When ""walm"" follows a color-denoting word, the color associated with that word is repeated three times.

Here is the breakdown by example:
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" so ""walm"" following ""dax"" (which stands for ""green"") results in ""green"" being repeated three times.
- ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" leads to ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow,"" so after the initial ""green"" for ""dax,"" ""wif walm"" results in ""red"" being repeated three times and ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow"" being repeated three times.
- ""zup walm lug wif"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red,"" indicating that ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow"" being repeated three times.
- ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" leads to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red,"" meaning that after a yellow and blue for ""zup"" and ""lug"", respectively, ""zup walm"" once again results in ""yellow"" being repeated three times.
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" again showing that ""walm"" following ""lug"" (which stands for ""blue"") results in ""blue"" being repeated three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word that corresponds to a color, the output is that color repeated three times.

walm -> causes the immediately preceding color word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,115
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it seems that each nonce word translates to a color and the repetition of colors may be influenced by certain words. Here's the pattern I deduce from the examples:

- ""zup"" appears to translate to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" appears to translate to ""red""
- ""lug"" seems to translate to ""blue""
- ""walm"" provides repetition of the last color mentioned
- ""bluf"" seems to also translate to ""blue""
- ""dax"" seems to translate to ""green""

From this, we can conclude:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, the output seems to be a sequence of colors that correspond to the input words. The input always includes the nonce word ""dax"", and the output includes the color ""green"" in positions corresponding to the occurrence of ""dax"" in the input. It appears that the input words other than ""dax"" also correspond to specific colors in the output.

Here are the observed correlations for each word:

- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"" (seen in input 1 and 2).
- ""walm"" correlates with ""green"" (seen in input 2 and 4).
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"" (seen in input 2 and 3).
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red"" (seen in input 3 and 4).
- ""bluf"" correlates with ""red"" (seen in input 4 and 5), although this is not consistent with the name ""bluf"" suggesting a relation to ""blue."" However, given the limited data, it seems to correlate with ""red"" in the output.

Given this information, the rule for ""dax"" appears to be consistently associated with the output color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or surrounding context. Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" When ""wif"" appears alone, the output is ""red"". When ""wif"" appears with another word, it maintains its meaning, but the meaning of the additional word must be inferred separately; for example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is present in the input, the color ""yellow"" appears in the output. The other words in the input correspond to different colors (e.g. ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" to a repetition of the last mentioned color).

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to take on the meaning of the English color word that precedes it. Here is the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"" and ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green.""
- In the second example, ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow,"" where ""bluf"" takes the meaning of ""yellow"" from the word ""zup"" that precedes it.
- In the third example, ""lug bluf wif"" translates to ""blue blue red,"" where ""bluf"" means ""blue"" which is the color associated with the word ""lug"" that comes just before it.
- In the fourth example, ""dax bluf"" simply translates to ""green green,"" where ""bluf"" means ""green,"" the color associated with ""dax.""
- In the final example, ""lug bluf zup lug"" translates to ""blue blue yellow blue,"" where once again ""bluf"" takes the meaning of ""blue"" from ""lug.""

Given the consistent pattern, we can propose the following rule for the nonce word ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" -> takes the meaning of the English color word immediately before it. If the preceding word is a color, then ""bluf"" is a repetition of that color. If there is no color word preceding it, the examples do not provide guidance as to what ""bluf"" might mean, so it can't be determined from the given data.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", let's analyze the patterns seen in the given examples:

- ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""walm"" may cause the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, which in this case is ""zup -> yellow.""
- Similarly, ""dax walm"" yields ""green green green,"" which supports the idea that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word before it, with ""dax -> green.""
- In the example ""dax zup walm wif"", the output is ""green yellow yellow yellow red"". This further suggests that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color tied to the word that comes immediately before it, as ""zup -> yellow"" is repeated thrice, followed by ""wif -> red.""
- The input ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" which is consistent with our working hypothesis.
- Lastly, ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" produces ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here ""wif -> red"" is repeated three times after ""walm"" and then ""zup -> yellow"" is similarly repeated three times after another ""walm,"" while ""lug"" introduces a new color ""blue.""

So we can conclude:

Rule: ""walm"" -> ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif
    ",Output: green red,green red,True,116
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue.""
Based on the given examples, we can infer the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" by looking at the corresponding color output in each instance. Here is what we can observe from each input-output pair:

1. Input: ""dax lug wif walm""  -> Output: ""green blue red red red""
Here, ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

2. Input: ""wif zup dax bluf"" -> Output: ""red yellow green green""
Here, ""dax"" again corresponds to the color ""green.""

3. Input: ""zup dax"" -> Output: ""yellow green""
Once more, ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

4. Input: ""dax zup lug wif zup"" -> Output: ""green yellow blue red yellow""
In this sequence, ""dax"" maps to ""green.""

5. Input: ""zup bluf dax"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow green""
And again, ""dax"" is equivalent to the color ""green.""

Given that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"" in each provided example, we can deduce that:

Rule: dax -> ""green""
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we must compare the inputs and their corresponding outputs, looking for patterns associated with the usage of the word ""wif.""

Let's look at the commonalities and differences in the examples provided:

1. Input: ""dax walm wif zup"" => Output: ""green green green red yellow""
   - ""dax"" and ""walm"" both correlate with ""green.""
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow.""

2. Input: ""zup wif lug wif"" => Output: ""yellow red blue red""
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow.""
   - ""lug"" correlates with ""blue.""

3. Input: ""wif walm dax zup"" => Output: ""red red red green yellow""
   - ""walm"" and ""dax"" again correlate with ""red"" and ""green"" respectively, which is different from the first example.

4. Input: ""wif lug wif"" => Output: ""red blue red""
   - ""lug"" correlates with ""blue.""

5. Input: ""zup wif dax"" => Output: ""yellow red green""
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"" and ""dax"" with ""green.""

From these observations, we can notice that every time the word ""wif"" appears, it corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. It doesn't seem to matter what position ""wif"" is in the input; it consistently results in ""red"" in the output.

We can then conclude the following rule:

Rule: ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input or the context of other words. Thus:

wif -> red
From the given examples, we can try to deduce the meanings of the words based on their consistent associations with certain outputs.

- In examples where ""zup"" is present, the output always contains the word ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" in the output.
- ""bluf"" seems to translate to ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup"" and to ""red"" when not, based on the second example, although this isn't consistent with the fourth and fifth examples. 
- ""lug"" correlates with the output ""blue.""

Now, focusing on ""zup,"" we can see that regardless of its position, whether it is at the beginning, middle, or end of the input, the corresponding output always contains ""yellow."" Furthermore, ""zup"" does not appear to modify the words around it based on the given examples; it just translates directly to ""yellow.""

Based on this analysis, the rule seems to be:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Let's analyze the instances where ""bluf"" is used:

1. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
- ""zup"" yields ""yellow""
- ""wif"" yields ""red""

2. wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
- ""lug"" yields ""blue""
- ""walm"" yields ""blue""
- ""dax"" yields ""green""

3. wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> red green red red yellow red
- ""dax"" yields ""green""
- ""zup"" yields ""yellow""

4. zup lug zup lug zup bluf -> yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
- The pattern ""zup lug zup lug zup"" is consistent with ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow.""

5. wif dax bluf -> red green green
- We can see that ""wif"" yields ""red"" and ""dax"" yields ""green.""

Looking at the sequences, ""bluf"" seems to take the color of the previously mentioned color in the sequence except in the second example where ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which yields green but ""bluf"" yields yellow. Given the examples we have, the behavior of ""bluf"" does not seem consistent.

However, in examples 1, 3, and 4 where ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (which yields ""yellow"") or ""wif"" (which yields ""red""), ""bluf"" yields a similar color to its preceding word (""yellow"" following ""zup"" and ""red"" following ""wif""). This may suggest that when following ""zup"" or ""wif"" ""bluf"" repeats the color.

Based on the evidence at hand, a potential rule could be:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the same color as the preceding word if the preceding word is ""zup"" (yellow) or ""wif"" (red). However, this rule does not explain the second example where ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (green) but produces ""yellow"" instead of ""green."" In this case, more examples or additional context would be necessary to determine the rule governing the output of ""bluf."" 

Given the inconsistency observed, we might be missing a crucial piece of context that impacts how ""bluf"" behaves, or there may be additional conditions affecting its output that are not evident from the examples provided.
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" as follows:

When we observe the output of examples 1 and 4, the pattern for ""wif walm"" is consistently ""red red red"". This suggests that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the word just before it.

In example 2, ""zup dax lug walm zup"" translates to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow."" Here, ""walm"" again seems to cause the repetition of the color associated with ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

In example 3, ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" becomes ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue,"" and here ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" once more resulting in repeating the color ""blue.""

Finally, in example 5, ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue,"" reinforcing the rule deduced from the prior examples.

The induced rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color last referenced before it. Therefore:

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the preceding color's name in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup walm dax lug zup
    ",Output: blue yellow yellow yellow green blue yellow,blue yellow yellow yellow green blue yellow,True,117
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" in each example corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples provided, whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""green."" Therefore, it can be deduced that ""dax"" means green.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of the context in which it is used. Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. The other words in the inputs (""dax,"" ""bluf,"" and ""zup"") similarly correspond to other colors (""green"" and ""yellow"") in the outputs. No evidence suggests that ""wif"" has a more complex meaning or changes based on context within these examples. Therefore:

wif -> meaning: The word ""wif"" means ""red."" 

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" is presented as input, it is translated directly to ""red"" in the output.
zup -> ""yellow""

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it translates to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position or the context within the sequence of words.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" results in the output color being repeated for however many nonce words precede it. 

Let's break down each example:

1. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red: ""bluf"" follows two nonce words (""zup"" and ""wif""), resulting in ""red"" being repeated twice.
2. wif bluf zup -> red red yellow: ""bluf"" follows one nonce word (""wif""), resulting in ""red"" being repeated once.
3. dax bluf -> green green: ""bluf"" follows one nonce word (""dax""), resulting in ""green"" being repeated once.
4. lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue: ""bluf"" follows one nonce word (""lug""), resulting in ""blue"" being repeated once.
5. wif lug zup bluf -> red blue yellow yellow: ""bluf"" follows three nonce words (""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""zup""), resulting in ""yellow"" being repeated three times.

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> The color corresponding to the nonce word immediately before ""bluf"" is repeated for as many times as there are nonce words before ""bluf"" in the sequence.

(Note: It is assumed that each word corresponds to a specific color, for example, ""wif"" might correspond to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue,"" based on the provided examples.)
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we'll examine its position relative to the other words and the corresponding outputs.

In the first example, ""lug walm zup lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue."" Here, the word ""lug"" results in ""blue."" ""zup"" results in a single ""yellow."" Notice that ""walm"" appears twice and is followed by ""blue"" thrice both times, just like the output for ""lug.""

In the second example, ""dax walm wif zup,"" we have ""green green green red yellow."" ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow."" After ""walm"" the output sequence of colors is ""green red yellow,"" which corresponds with the sequence that ""dax,"" ""wif,"" and ""zup"" should produce based on individual color assignments.

In the third example, ""wif walm dax zup,"" we have ""red red red green yellow."" Here, ""walm"" precedes a sequence ""red green yellow,"" which would match the outputs of ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup,"" respectively.

In the fourth example, ""dax wif walm,"" the result is ""green red red red,"" which indicates that ""walm"" results in multiple ""red"" outputs, the same as ""wif.""

In the last example, ""lug walm,"" we have ""blue blue blue,"" showing that ""walm"" results in multiple ""blue"" outputs, indicating that it duplicates the output of the preceding word.

Rule: ""walm"" appears to repeat the color associated with the word that precedes it three times.

Walm -> meaning. Meaning: ""walm"" causes the next three colors in the output to be the same as the color designated to the word that appears immediately before ""walm.""

Rule: When ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output is ""blue"" thrice. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" thrice. When ""walm"" is after ""wif,"" the output is ""red"" thrice.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax
    ",Output: red green,red green,True,118
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" is encountered in the input, it translates to ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green. 

Rule: ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the provided sequence of examples, irrespective of its position within the sequence. Other words such as ""lug"" and ""wif"" translate to ""blue"" and ""red"" respectively, and maintain their translation even when the position of ""dax"" changes.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Each instance of ""wif"" in the input is replaced with ""red"" in the output. Additionally, other nonce words seem to correlate with other colors: ""bluf"" with blue, ""lug"" with blue, ""zup"" with yellow, and ""dax"" with green.

Thus, the rule for the word ""wif"" is:

wif -> red
Based on the examples provided:

- When ""zup"" is combined with ""dax,"" ""bluf,"" ""wif,"" ""walm,"" and ""lug,"" the outputs are a sequence of colors. Specifically, ""zup"" precedes colors such as: yellow, green, yellow for ""dax zup bluf.""
  
- ""Zup"" on its own translates to ""yellow,"" as seen in the final example: ""zup"" produces the output ""yellow.""

- In all instances, ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow,"" regardless of the context or the words that follow it.

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" across the given examples is:

Rule: zup -> yellow. The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
Rule: ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the word before it. 

For example:
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red.""

Specifically:
- ""wif bluf lug"" shows that ""lug"" on its own corresponds to ""blue,"" but it is not affected by ""bluf"" because ""bluf"" only affects the word immediately before it.
- ""zup wif bluf"" once again demonstrates that ""bluf"" affects ""wif,"" resulting in ""yellow red red,"" not ""yellow yellow"" which would have been the case if ""bluf"" repeated ""zup.""

Therefore:
bluf -> meaning is that it causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to replicate the color implied by the word preceding it. Here's the pattern seen in each line:

- In ""dax wif walm,"" ""dax"" correlates with green, and ""wif"" with red. ""Walm"" replicates the red color mentioned directly before it, thus leading to the output ""green red red red.""
- In ""dax lug walm,"" ""lug"" correlates with blue. ""Walm"" replicates the blue, leading to the output ""green blue blue blue.""
- In ""dax walm zup,"" ""walm"" comes directly after ""dax,"" which correlates with green, and before ""zup,"" which correlates with yellow. ""Walm"" replicates the green from ""dax,"" leading to an output of ""green green green yellow.""
- In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" correlates with yellow. Without any word between ""zup"" and ""walm,"" ""walm"" replicates the yellow from ""zup,"" resulting in the output ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" correlates with blue. Without any word between ""lug"" and ""walm,"" ""walm"" replicates the blue from ""lug,"" leading to the output ""blue blue blue.""

From these examples, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" replicates the color value of the word that immediately precedes it in the list.

Rule: walm -> replicates the color value of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: 'lug' consistently translates to the color 'blue' regardless of its position in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we need to look for patterns in the input and the corresponding output.

1. In the first example, ""dax walm zup walm"" is translated to ""green green green yellow yellow yellow"". The repetition of ""walm"" and ""yellow"" suggests that ""walm"" correlates with ""yellow."" Additionally, both ""dax"" and ""zup"" result in ""green,"" but ""zup"" also appears in other sequences with different colors in the output.

2. The second example, ""dax zup lug wif lug,"" yields ""green yellow blue red blue."" ""Dax"" results in ""green"" again, and the repetition of ""lug"" yielding ""blue"" both times suggests that ""lug"" correlates with ""blue."" ""Wif"" results in ""red.""

3. In the third example, the word ""dax"" again correlates with ""green"" in the output, while the word ""lug"" consistently yields ""blue.""

4. The fourth example shows ""dax"" in between two ""bluf"" words and the output is ""red red green green."" It seems that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""

5. The fifth example again has ""dax"" at the beginning, and it translates to ""green.""

From these examples, we can notice that no matter where ""dax"" appears in the sequence, the color ""green"" is always the output. Thus, we can deduce that ""dax"" always correlates with the color ""green,"" regardless of context or position within the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it seems that each nonce word translates to a specific color. The word ""wif"" appears to correspond to the color ""red"" each time it is used. Here are the corresponding associations based on the input and output provided:

- lug -> blue
- bluf -> red (although it might be a mistake since the word suggests blue, but based on the provided data, it translates to red)
- dax -> green
- walm -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" means ""yellow"" in this context, consistently translating to the color yellow regardless of its position in the sequence.
bluf -> meaning. Rule: ""bluf"" causes the preceding word's color to be repeated. For example, following ""dax"" with ""bluf"" leads to ""green"" being repeated, just as ""wif"" leads to ""red"" being repeated, and ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"" being repeated.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to cause the output to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it, three times. Here is the rule deduced from the examples:

1. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"": ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" so ""walm"" causes it to repeat three times.
2. ""dax walm wif dax"" -> ""green green green red green"": ""dax"" results in ""green,"" so ""walm"" causes ""green"" to repeat three times followed by ""wif"" which translates to ""red"" and another ""dax"" which is ""green.""
3. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue"": ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" so after ""dax green,"" ""lug"" is followed by ""blue,"" and ""walm"" makes it repeat three times.
4. ""zup dax lug walm zup"" -> ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow"": ""lug"" before ""walm"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats it three times with ""zup"" resulting in ""yellow"" at the beginning and the end.
5. ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue"": ""lug"" before ""walm"" translates to ""blue,"" so ""walm"" repeats it three times after ""wif"" which is ""red.""

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color output of the word immediately before it to repeat three times.

Walm -> meaning: A repetition operator that causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow blue,yellow yellow yellow blue,True,120
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To determine the meaning of ""lug,"" let's examine where it appears and what outputs correspond to its presence:

In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" 

- Input: wif lug dax walm
- Output: red blue green green

In the second example, despite ""lug"" being in the middle of other words, it still corresponds to ""blue.""

- Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
- Output: yellow yellow blue yellow red green

In the third example, ""lug"" is adjacent to ""walm,"" and both times it corresponds to ""blue.""

- Input: lug walm
- Output: blue blue blue

In the fourth example, ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue.""

- Input: lug wif dax
- Output: blue red green

In the fifth example, ""lug"" appears at the end and corresponds to ""blue.""

- Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
- Output: green yellow red red blue

Across all the examined instances, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of position in the sequence or the surrounding words. Therefore, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Each time ""dax"" appears in an input, ""green"" appears in the output. Other words in the examples (like ""wif"" and ""lug"") seem to correspond to their own respective colors, with ""wif"" corresponding to red and ""lug"" to blue. The word ""walm"" does not correspond to its own color, but rather causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated; thus ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green.""
Based on the given examples, the nonce word 'wif' can be translated to the color 'red' each time it appears in the input. Here's how it correlates with the outputs:

- In the first example, 'wif' corresponds to 'red', and 'dax' corresponds to 'green'.
- In the second example, 'wif bluf dax walm' corresponds to 'red red green green green', with 'wif' translating to 'red', and it follows the pattern established in the first example.
- In the third example, 'wif' on its own translates to 'red'.
- In the fourth example, 'dax zup lug wif lug' has 'wif' translate to 'red', consistent with its translation in the rest of the examples.
- In the fifth example, 'dax walm wif' translates to 'green green green red', with 'wif' once again meaning 'red'.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in a sequence of words.
Based on the provided examples, the word 'bluf' consistently corresponds to 'red' except when it follows the word 'dax' (in input example 4), where it results in 'green.' In the third example, 'bluf' follows 'zup' and yields 'yellow.' However, in the first two examples, 'bluf' is also preceded by different words ('wif' and 'dax', respectively), but still corresponds to 'red.' This inconsistency suggests that the rule for 'bluf' is context-dependent. 

Here’s the breakdown by each example:

- Example 1: 'wif bluf' results in 'red red.' 'Bluf' here corresponds to 'red'.
- Example 2: 'wif bluf' also results in 'red red.' The context is the same as in Example 1, reinforcing that 'bluf' translates to 'red' after 'wif.'
- Example 3: 'zup bluf' results in 'yellow yellow,' indicating that when 'bluf' follows 'zup,' it means 'yellow.'
- Example 4: 'lug dax bluf' results in 'blue green green.' The only change to the color sequence occurs after 'dax,' where 'bluf' results in 'green.'
- Example 5: 'wif bluf' results yet again in 'red red,' supporting the initial conclusion when 'bluf' follows 'wif.'

Rule: The meaning of 'bluf' changes based on the word that comes immediately before it. When 'bluf' follows 'wif' or stands alone, it means 'red.' When 'bluf' follows 'dax,' it means 'green.' When 'bluf' follows 'zup,' it means 'yellow.' There is no information on what 'bluf' means when it follows 'lug,' as it is always paired with 'dax' in that context, so we assume the 'dax' rule takes precedence.

bluf -> meaning:
- After 'wif' or standalone: 'red'
- After 'dax': 'green'
- After 'zup': 'yellow'
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we look at the patterns before and after the word appears in each input and their corresponding outputs.

- In the first example, ""dax wif walm"" turns into ""green red red red,"" where ""red"" is the only color that repeats, and ""walm"" is the only word in the input that does not correspond to a single color in the output.

- In the second example, ""lug walm wif lug"" maps to ""blue blue blue red blue."" We can see that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" likely corresponds to ""red,"" as seen in the first and last examples. ""Walm"" occurs once and correlates with three instances of ""blue.""

- The third example, ""lug dax walm,"" outputs ""blue green green green."" Again, ""lug"" and ""dax"" correspond to ""blue"" and ""green"" respectively. Since ""walm"" results in ""green green green,"" it seems to repeat the color prior to its position.

- In the fourth example, ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red."" The word ""walm"" again correlates with a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

- The fifth example, ""dax walm wif,"" turns into ""green green green red."" Here ""walm"" repeats the color related to ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

From these observations, the rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color of the word before it thrice. For instance, if the word before ""walm"" corresponds to ""green,"" then ""walm"" results in ""green green green.""

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow yellow blue blue blue red yellow green,yellow yellow yellow blue blue blue red yellow green,False,121
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" is present in the input, the output always includes the color ""blue"". It appears to be an independent component in the pattern, as the occurrence of ""lug"" does not seem to depend on the presence of other words, and it always directly translates to ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the inputs and outputs provided, it is possible to induce the meaning or rule of the nonce word ""dax."" By checking where ""dax"" is in the input and what word is it translated to in the output, we can deduce the following:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, it is translated to ""green"" in the output.
- It seems that ""dax"" is independent of its position in the input sequence since it always results in ""green,"" whether it is at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of the input string.
- Other words in the examples—such as ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""wif""—are consistently translated to ""blue,"" ""yellow,"" and ""red,"" respectively.

Hence, the rule for ""dax"" can be written as:

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning or the rule that the word ""wif"" follows, we can look for a consistent pattern between the input and the output in the examples given:

- Input: wif -> Output: red
- Input: lug wif walm -> Output: blue red red red
- Input: dax wif -> Output: green red
- Input: zup walm wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow red
- Input: wif -> Output: red

In each of these examples, whenever the word 'wif' appears in the input, a 'red' appears in the output. No other word in the input is consistently translated to 'red' in the output.

Also, notice that 'walm' always results in repeated output colors ('red' or 'yellow') corresponding to the number of letters in the preceding word. For instance, 'lug walm' results in 'blue red red red', indicating the color 'red' repeats three times just as 'lug' has three letters.

Now we know that 'walm' also has a meaning; it means to repeat the color of the preceding word a number of times equal to the number of letters in that word.

Let's deduce the rules with this information:

- The word 'wif' is directly translated to the color 'red' in every instance.
- Other words seem to be translated into distinct colors ('lug' into 'blue', 'dax' into 'green', 'zup' into 'yellow').

Rule: wif -> red.
Rule: zup -> yellow

The pattern consistently shows that any word after ""zup"" gets the color that represents it, followed by ""yellow"" which represents ""zup"". Thus, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".
Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the rule behind the nonce word ""bluf."" Let's analyze the correspondence between the input items and their outputs:

1. wif bluf dax -> red red green
2. wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> red red yellow red blue green
3. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
4. lug wif dax bluf wif lug -> blue red green green red blue
5. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green

From the examples, we can observe that ""bluf"" always corresponds to the same color that directly precedes it:

1. ""wif"" is red, and ""bluf"" after it is also red.
2. The sequence ""zup wif lug dax"" repeats as ""yellow red blue green,"" and ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" which is yellow, so ""bluf"" becomes yellow as well.
3. ""zup"" is yellow and is directly followed by ""bluf,"" which is also yellow.
4. In this case, ""dax"" is green, and ""bluf"" after it is also green.
5. Again, ""dax"" is green and is directly followed by ""bluf,"" which is also green.

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it duplicates the color associated with the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the word before it.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine its occurrences in the inputs and corresponding outputs:

1. lug walm zup lug walm -> blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
2. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
3. wif lug dax walm -> red blue green green green
4. dax walm -> green green green
5. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green

If we try to identify a pattern correlating to ""walm,"" we need to observe what each item translates to and how ""walm"" affects the sequence.

- Each word in the input (non-""walm"") results in a color in the output: ""lug"" is blue, ""zup"" is yellow, ""wif"" is red, and ""dax"" is green.

- When ""walm"" appears after a single word, the output is three instances of the color associated with that word. For example:
  - dax walm -> green green green
  - zup wif walm -> yellow red red red (note that ""wif"" is red, followed by three reds)
  
- When ""walm"" appears after two words, as in the first example, it seems that the first word's color is repeated twice (blue blue for ""lug""), followed by the second word's color once (yellow for ""zup""), and then ""walm"" introduces two more of the first word's color (more ""blue"").

Based on these observations, a rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it triggers repetition of the colors preceding it, with a specific pattern of the number of times:

First case: When ""walm"" is preceded by one word, it produces three instances of the color.
Second case: When ""walm"" follows a two-word sequence where ""lug"" precedes it, it repeats the first color twice, allows the second color once, and then repeats the first color twice more.

However, we have insufficient data to fully determine what would happen if ""walm"" follows a two-word sequence where ""dax"" or ""zup"" precedes it, or if ""walm"" follows more than two words.

Based on the limited examples we have:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color word, it repeats the corresponding color three times. When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and then another color word, it repeats the ""lug"" color twice, places the second color once, and repeats the ""lug"" color twice more. The rule for sequences of two words other than ""lug"" followed by ""walm,"" or if there are more than two words before ""walm"" is indeterminate with the provided data.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,122
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position or repetition in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Here is the breakdown of the rule induction:

- In the first example, ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the output is ""green"" followed by ""blue,"" which seems to indicate that ""lug"" means ""blue."" Since ""dax"" precedes ""lug,"" it is logical to assume that ""dax"" means ""green.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" appears twice, and each time it is followed by the output ""green."" ""Walm"" appears after ""dax"" and the output ""green,"" followed by ""red,"" followed by ""blue,"" followed by ""green,"" seems to indicate the color sequence and confirms that ""dax"" is indeed ""green.""
- The third example again includes ""dax"" before ""lug,"" which produces ""green"" before ""blue."" ""Zup"" appears before ""bluf"" and ""wif,"" leading to outputs ""yellow"" and ""red"" respectively, further confirming that ""dax"" is ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf,"" resulting in ""green"" and then ""green"" again for ""zup,"" which seems to break the rule. However, since the sequence is ambiguous, let's assume ""dax"" stands for ""green,"" and look for explanations in the broader context.
- In the last example, ""zup"" and ""dax"" appear one after the other, resulting in ""yellow"" and ""green,"" which fits our running theory.

Considering the information from all the examples, the most consistent interpretation is that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" we first need to look for patterns in the examples provided. Let's start by seeing where ""wif"" appears and what the corresponding output is:

- Example 1: dax bluf wif zup wif -> green green red yellow red
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and is followed by ""zup"" (yellow) and then ""wif"" again (red).
  
- Example 2: wif zup -> red yellow
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and is followed by ""zup"" (yellow).

- Example 3: wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and is followed by ""bluf"" (red), ""dax"" (green), and ""walm"" (green green).
  
- Example 4: zup wif lug dax -> yellow red blue green
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and is followed by ""lug"" (blue) and ""dax"" (green).
  
- Example 5: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and appears after ""bluf"" (yellow) and ""dax"" (green), and is followed by ""zup"" (yellow) then ""bluf"" again (yellow) and ""lug"" (blue).

Now, let's try to deduce the rule:

- In all instances, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red.""

There are no obvious conditions or context-dependent rules that affect the output for ""wif"" based on the examples provided. It appears to have a one-to-one mapping with the color ""red,"" regardless of its position or the surrounding words. 

Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Regardless of its position in the input sequence or the number of times it appears, ""zup"" consistently translates to the word ""yellow"" in the given examples.
bluf -> repeats the color associated with the word that precedes it. 

Rule: When bluf follows another word, the output color is the same as the color represented by the word before bluf. For example:
- ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"" because lug means blue.
- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"" because wif means red.
- ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"" because dax means green.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the output is a sequence of colors, with each color corresponding to a specific input word. 

For ""zup,"" the consistent output is yellow. 
For ""lug,"" the consistent output is blue. 
For ""wif,"" the consistent output is red. 
For ""dax,"" the consistent output is green. 

Now examining the instances where ""walm"" is used, it consistently results in repeating the color associated with the preceding word three times. For instance:

- In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In ""lug wif walm lug,"" we see that after ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, the output is ""red red red,"" and then it continues with ""blue"" for ""lug.""
- In ""dax wif walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, and the output is ""green red red red"" (with ""dax"" corresponding to green before that).
- In ""lug walm zup lug zup wif,"" the sequence following ""walm"" is ""blue blue blue,"" which is the repetition of the color associated with ""lug.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,123
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word 'lug' appears in the input, the corresponding output is 'blue'.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the output colors corresponding to each appearance of ""dax"" and the other words in the inputs:

In the first example, ""wif walm dax"" gives the output of ""red red red green."" Since ""dax"" is different from ""wif"" and ""walm,"" and the colors associated with them (""red"") are also different, it's reasonable to assume that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

In the second example, ""dax wif dax"" gives the output ""green red green."" Both instances of ""dax"" correspond to ""green,"" supporting the initial assumption.

In the third example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" which implies that ""dax"" is once more translating to ""green,"" but it also raises the possibility that ""walm"" might be related to ""green"" under certain conditions.

In the fourth example, ""zup dax wif"" results in ""yellow green red."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"" again, which is consistent with our earlier observations.

In the fifth example, ""dax lug wif"" gives ""green blue red."" ""Dax"" is still associated with ""green,"" further reinforcing the idea that ""dax"" means ""green.""

Taking into account all the examples provided, we can deduce that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided:

- ""lug walm wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue red""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- ""lug wif dax zup walm"" translates to ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow""
- ""dax wif"" translates to ""green red""
- ""dax zup wif"" translates to ""green yellow red""

It seems that regardless of the position of ""wif"" in a sequence or the words that come before or after it, the output for ""wif"" is always ""red"".

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of context. There is no example that contradicts this direct substitution. Each time ""zup"" is in the input, ""yellow"" appears at the corresponding position in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word that directly precedes it. Here's the evidence supporting this deduction:

1. In ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, and the output is ""red red,"" showing that ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""wif,"" which is red.
2. ""lug bluf zup lug"" translates to ""blue blue yellow blue,"" so ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""lug,"" which is blue, before it moves on to the next word, ""zup,"" which is yellow.
3. ""dax lug bluf wif"" produces ""green blue blue red,"" so ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""lug,"" which is blue, again.
4. Finally, ""lug bluf zup"" translates to ""blue blue yellow,"" which further supports that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it.

Given these observations, we can write the rule as follows:

Rule: In this context, ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Hence:
bluf -> meaning. Meaning is to repeat the color of the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to indicate a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. Here's the breakdown:

- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"" implying that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" indicates repeating that color thrice.
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" which means ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats that color thrice.
- ""dax lug wif walm"" provides ""green blue red red red,"" showing that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats the color of the immediately preceding word (""wif"" in this case) thrice.
- ""dax walm wif walm zup"" results in ""green green green red red red yellow,"" which confirms that ""walm"" is consistent in behavior - repeating the color associated with the directly preceding word. ""Zup"" introduces ""yellow,"" reinforcing that ""walm"" doesn't affect colors that are introduced after it.
- Finally, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" meaning ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats that color thrice.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position or the context in which it appears in the sentence.
Based on the provided examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green

Input: dax lug
Output: green blue

Input: dax
Output: green

Input: dax lug
Output again: green blue

Input: dax
Output again: green

Taking these examples into account, we can determine that every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" is included in the output. This consistency allows us to conclude that the meaning of ""dax"" is directly associated with the output ""green."" The rest of the inputs (""wif walm"" and ""lug"") correspond to other colors in the output (""red"" and ""blue"" respectively), but ""dax"" is consistently related to ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we need to compare inputs with their respective outputs:

1. dax wif bluf -> green red red
2. wif lug dax lug -> red blue green blue
3. lug wif dax bluf wif lug -> blue red green green red blue
4. wif zup dax -> red yellow green
5. dax bluf wif lug -> green green red blue

By comparing the inputs and outputs, we can see that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" to ""green"" as well. Let's isolate the instances of ""wif"":

1. wif in ""dax wif bluf"" corresponds to red
2. wif in ""wif lug dax lug"" corresponds to the first red
3. wif in ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" corresponds to the first and third red
4. wif in ""wif zup dax"" corresponds to red
5. wif in ""dax bluf wif lug"" corresponds to red

So based on the examples provided, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
Analyzing the given examples:

1. Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
   Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow

2. Input: dax wif zup dax
   Output: green red yellow green

3. Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
   Output: green green red yellow red

4. Input: zup dax lug zup
   Output: yellow green blue yellow

5. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue

From the above examples, it can be observed that whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output. The word ""zup"" does not depend on its position in the sentence or the context of the surrounding words. Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" can be stated as a direct translation regardless of context. 

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" represents a color. However, the specific color that ""bluf"" represents changes based on the preceding word. Here's the pattern deduced from the examples:

1. ""dax wif bluf"" outputs ""green red red"", where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" in this context.
2. ""dax bluf"" outputs ""green green"", where ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""bluf"" is also ""green"" when it follows ""dax"".
3. ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" outputs ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow"", where ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", and ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup"".
4. ""zup bluf lug"" outputs ""yellow yellow blue"", where ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup"", and ""lug"" is ""blue"".
5. ""zup bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow"", where ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup"".

From these examples, we can deduce a rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" mirrors the color represented by the word immediately preceding it.

Therefore, based on the above rule:

bluf -> When following ""dax,"" ""bluf"" means green.
bluf -> When following ""zup,"" ""bluf"" means yellow.
bluf -> When following ""wif,"" which is not demonstrated, but would likely follow the established pattern, ""bluf"" would mean the color represented by ""wif."" (From the given examples we know ""wif"" represents red, so in that specific instance ""bluf"" would mean red when following ""wif"").
Rule: walm -> ""Repeat the color of the previous word one or more times""

Explanation:

- In the first example, ""lug dax walm"" translates to ""blue green green green green,"" which means ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax"" (green) three times.

- In the second example, ""wif zup walm dax zup"" gives ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow."" Here, ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup"" (yellow) three times.

- In the third example, ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red"". ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" and repeats its color (blue) twice.

- In the fourth example, ""zup walm"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow,"" so ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup"" (yellow) twice.

- In the fifth example, ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red,"" again ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup"" (yellow) three times.

Therefore, ""walm"" indicates the repetition of the color of the word that comes directly before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug wif lug
    ",Output: green blue red blue,green blue red blue,True,125
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Given the examples, we can infer the following:

- When the input is a single ""lug,"" the output is ""blue."" This suggests that ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

- In the second example, ""wif lug walm"" translates to ""red blue blue blue."" We can notice that ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" also to ""blue."" This suggests that ""lug"" consistently means ""blue,"" but we do not have enough information to infer a rule for ""walm"" yet.

- In the third example, ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" appears to translate to ""yellow"" as well, given the context.

- In the fourth example, ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" translates to ""blue red red green blue blue."" ""Lug"" means ""blue,"" ""wif"" means ""red,"" ""bluf"" may mean ""red"" here, and ""dax"" translates to ""green."" However, this contradicts the previous example where ""bluf"" translated to ""yellow."" It's possible that ""bluf"" changes meaning based on context, or an additional rule applies that has not yet been discerned.

- In the final example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue."" This suggests ""lug"" means ""blue"" and ""walm"" means ""blue blue"" or that ""walm"" causes the color blue to be repeated once.

From the given information, the best rule we can deduce is that ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" However, more information would be needed to accurately determine the meaning or rule governing the words ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" ""dax,"" and ""walm.""

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce a consistent pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"". In the context of each input-output pair, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"". 

Every time ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the same position in the output sequence. Here are the interpretations of each example:

- Input: dax zup lug wif zup | Output: green yellow blue red yellow
- Input: zup dax bluf | Output: yellow green green
- Input: zup wif zup dax | Output: yellow red yellow green
- Input: lug dax lug | Output: blue green blue
- Input: dax wif bluf | Output: green red red

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.
zup -> yellow. Rule: Every instance of the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow.
To figure out the rule for ""bluf,"" we observe the relationship between the given inputs and their corresponding outputs. Here's a summary of the examples:

1. ""zup bluf dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow green blue""
2. ""dax wif bluf"" -> ""green red red""
3. ""lug wif bluf lug wif"" -> ""blue red red blue red""
4. ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green yellow red green green""
5. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""green red yellow yellow red red red""

Looking at the data, we can try to identify a pattern for ""bluf"":

In example 1, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" and the output is ""green"" (same color as ""dax""). So, ""bluf"" might take on the color that follows it. 

However, in example 2, ""bluf"" doesn't have a word following it, yet the output is ""red."" This contradicts our initial guess.

In examples 3 and 5, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" and ""wif"" respectively, and the output is ""red"" for both, which doesn't align with ""lug"" (blue) or ""wif"" (red).

Example 4 is key: ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green yellow red green green."" Here ""wif"" and ""dax"" come before and after ""bluf,"" but the output for ""bluf"" is ""green,"" which corresponds only with ""dax.""

Looking at all the patterns, we can conclude that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word that comes before it, but when ""bluf"" is the last word in the sequence, as in example 2, it defaults to ""red.""

Thus the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be: 

Rule: bluf takes on the color of the word that directly precedes it in the sequence; if bluf appears at the end with no word following it, the output is ""red."" 

Therefore: bluf -> meaning. Meaning: follow the color of the preceding word or default to red if there is no following word.
Based on the given examples, we can establish a few preliminary observations:

1. The output always contains a sequence of color words.
2. When the word ""walm"" is used, the output color appears to repeat.
3. The number of repeated colors is equal to the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence + 1.

Using these observations to establish a rule, let's examine the examples more closely:

- Input: ""zup wif walm"" and Output: ""yellow red red red""
  Here, ""walm"" is in position 3, thus there are 3 ""red"" in the output plus the color corresponding to ""zup"" which is ""yellow"".

- Input: ""dax lug walm"" and Output: ""green blue blue blue""
  Similarly, ""walm"" is in position 3, resulting in 3 ""blue"" plus the color for ""dax"" which is ""green"".

- Input: ""zup walm"" and Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
  ""Walm"" is in position 2, leading to 2 ""yellow"", and no color before ""zup"" in this instance.

- Input: ""wif dax zup walm"" and Output: ""red green yellow yellow yellow""
  ""Walm"" is in position 4, so there are 4 ""yellow"" plus the colors for ""wif"", ""dax"", and ""zup"" preceding them.

- Input: ""zup walm lug wif"" and Output: ""yellow yellow yellow blue red""
  ""Walm"" is in position 2, so there are 2 ""yellow"" following, and then the colors corresponding to ""lug"" and ""wif"".

Based on the above, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the color word that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm"". The number of repetitions equals the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word directly before ""walm"" to repeat a number of times equal to its position in the input list.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow,yellow yellow yellow,True,126
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided where the word ""lug"" appears and its relationship to the output, we can induce the following rule:

Input: lug zup
Output: blue yellow
Here, ""lug"" precedes ""zup"" and translates to ""blue"".

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
In this example, ""lug"" follows ""bluf"" and ""dax"" and still translates to ""blue"", asserting consistency.

Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
Output: red red yellow red blue green
Again, ""lug"" stands alone and translates to ""blue"".

Input: dax lug zup dax
Output: green blue yellow green
Here, ""lug"" follows ""dax"" and before ""zup"" and translates to ""blue"".

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue
Once more, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" and translates to ""blue"".

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the provided examples, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples given, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. 

The other words seem to correspond to other colors, but since the task is to deduce the meaning of ""wif"" only, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of the word ""zup,"" let's examine the input and output pairs:

1. When ""zup"" appears alone (""zup"" -> ""yellow""), ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow.""
2. When ""zup"" precedes ""lug"" (""zup lug"" -> ""yellow blue""), ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is translated to ""blue.""
3. When ""zup"" is surrounded by ""lug"" (""lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue""), ""zup"" is still translated to ""yellow.""
4. When ""zup"" comes after ""dax"" (""dax zup walm wif"" -> ""green yellow yellow yellow red""), ""zup"" is still translated to ""yellow.""
5. When ""zup"" is in a sequence with other words (""zup bluf lug dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow blue green blue""), the position of ""zup"" does not seem to change its translation; it consistently translates to ""yellow.""

From the available examples, it seems that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
From the provided examples, we observe the following:

- In the first input, the word 'bluf' is preceded by 'dax' and followed by 'wif'. The corresponding output sequence is ""green red green"". It's not immediately clear what 'bluf' corresponds to since we have two different colors flanking it.

- The second input consists of just 'wif bluf', with the output being ""red red"". Here, 'bluf' follows 'wif', and the output color for both is red.

- The third input consists of ‘zup bluf’ with the output ""yellow yellow"". Again, 'bluf' follows another word, this time 'zup', and the resulting color is the same for both.

- In the fourth input, 'bluf' is preceded by 'wif' and followed by 'dax'. The output sequence for these three is ""red red green"". Yet again, 'bluf' corresponds to red when followed by 'wif'.

Based on these examples, the rule is most clear in the cases where 'bluf' follows 'wif' or 'zup'; the output color is the same as the color representing the word preceding it. In the case with the sequence 'lug dax bluf wif dax', it's not immediately clear because 'bluf' sits between different colors.

However, in every instance where the context is clear, 'bluf' takes the same color of the word preceding it. When 'bluf' is preceded by 'wif' it is red, and when it is preceded by 'zup' it is yellow. Even though 'bluf' is not directly followed by any word in the second and third examples, the pattern of 'bluf' adopting the color of the preceding word appears to hold consistently.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: 'bluf' takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

bluf -> meaning: The color that corresponds to the word immediately before 'bluf'.
Considering the provided examples, each instance of ""walm"" appears to correspond to the repetition of the output color of the word directly preceding it. Observing the input and output pairs:

- In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". After ""walm"" is said, there is a repetition of ""yellow"" (which is the color associated with ""zup"").
- In the second and third examples, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the output is a repetition of ""yellow"" again.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". After ""walm"", there is an extra ""red"" in the output sequence.
- Lastly, in the fifth example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". After ""walm"", there is an extra ""blue"" in the output sequence.

From this pattern, we can deduce:

Rule: walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color of the previous word in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,127
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the inputs and outputs provided, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" Notice that in the first example:

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red

The word ""walm"" does not appear in any of the outputs, and thus its presence doesn't affect the sequence of colors. However, ""lug"" results in the output ""blue,"" and it's always followed by ""wif."" Examining the other inputs confirms the pattern that ""lug"" precedes another word and corresponds to ""blue."" Therefore, we can induce that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" no matter what word follows.

Rule: lug -> blue. The word ""lug"" directly translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" through pattern recognition:

Input: dax zup lug bluf -> Output: green yellow blue blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue""

Input: wif zup dax bluf -> Output: red yellow green green
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" (Note: This contradicts the previous example where ""bluf"" corresponded to ""blue"". It's possible that there's a typo or inconsistency in the examples. For this exercise, let's assume the color associated with ""bluf"" in this example is an error, and the correct output should be ""blue"" to maintain consistency.)

Input: lug zup dax zup -> Output: blue yellow green yellow
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Input: dax -> Output: green
- ""dax"" stands alone as ""green""

Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm -> Output: green green green red blue green green green
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""walm"" has no direct corresponding color, but it appears that it might have no output (null effect) or be a repetition, as the output is just a repetition of ""green"". 
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""walm"" (assuming it's null or a repetition, the output after it repeats the previous color)

Using these patterns across the examples, we can deduce that the nonce word ""dax"" means ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, we can induce the rule that each nonce word corresponds to a color. By examining the position and repetition of the word ""wif"" relative to other words and their associated colors, we aim to understand what ""wif"" represents.

Here is the analysis for each example:

Example 1:
- Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
- Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
- The words ""lug"" and ""zup"" are consistently mapping to ""blue"" and ""yellow,"" respectively. ""wif"" starts and ends the sequence, mapping to ""red"" initially and then ""red"" again when it repeats.

Example 2:
- Input: zup wif walm lug
- Output: yellow red red red blue
- Here, ""zup"" again maps to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"". ""wif"" and ""walm"" are followed by ""red,"" but ""wif"" comes second, and ""walm"" is associated with ""yellow"" in the first example, which suggests ""walm"" is not consistently representing ""red"".

Example 3:
- Input: wif lug zup bluf
- Output: red blue yellow yellow
- Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"".

Example 4:
- Input: dax wif
- Output: green red
- ""dax"" is followed by ""green,"" and ""wif"" is followed by ""red"".

Example 5:
- Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
- Output: blue green yellow green green green red
- Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""wif"", which appears at the end, to ""red"" once more.

There is a clear pattern where ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" whenever it appears in the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Here's the mapping according to each example:

- ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red""
- ""wif zup bluf lug"" translates to ""red yellow yellow blue""
- ""zup lug"" translates to ""yellow blue""
- ""wif zup lug"" translates to ""red yellow blue""
- ""lug zup dax wif"" translates to ""blue yellow green red""

In every case, the appearance of the word ""zup"" coincides with the color ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the sequences given in the examples, we can see a pattern regarding the word ""bluf"" and its translation:

1. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup lug"", the output is ""yellow blue blue"".
2. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug zup"", the output is ""blue yellow yellow"".
3. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax lug"", the output is ""green blue blue"".
4. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output is ""red red"".
5. When ""bluf"" stands alone following ""wif"", the output is still ""red red"".

Given this, it appears that ""bluf"" represents a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Specifically, the repeated word appears twice. Therefore, ""bluf"" means to repeat the color of the previous word twice. Additionally, when it stands alone following ""wif"", it may just denote repeating the color red twice without requiring a word to repeat.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word twice. If the previous word is ""wif"", the color is ""red""; otherwise, it follows the color for the word immediately before ""bluf"". If ""bluf"" stands alone after ""wif"", it defaults to ""red red"".
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look for patterns that correlate with the introduction of ""walm"" and how the outputs change in its presence:

1. When ""lug walm"" is in the input, the output is always ""blue blue blue."" When ""lug"" is present without ""walm,"" it also results in ""blue."" Therefore, ""lug"" correlates with ""blue.""

2. ""walm"" without ""lug"" or ""dax"" just precedes it seems to reproduce the color of the word just before it:
   - ""lug walm zup wif"" resulted in ""blue blue blue yellow red,"" where ""zup"" follows ""walm"" and ""yellow"" is introduced.
   - ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" resulted in ""blue blue blue green red blue red,"" where ""dax"" follows ""walm"" and ""green"" is introduced once ""dax"" appears.

3. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" gives ""green blue blue blue yellow red,"" suggesting that ""dax"" may introduce ""green,"" but when followed by ""walm,"" the ""blue"" from ""lug"" is repeated.

4. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" (like in ""dax walm wif""), the output is ""green green green red."" In this case, ""walm"" seems to repeating the color related to ""dax.""

Considering these examples, ""walm"" seems to be a word that repeats the color associated with the last unique color word before it. In other words, ""walm"" repeats the color output of the word immediately preceding it unless it is the same word.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the word before it unless that word is repeated. If the same word is repeated before ""walm,"" then ""walm"" continues to output the color associated with that word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,128
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, the output is ""blue.""
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the term ""dax"" consistently translates to the color green. Here is the analysis for each example:

- In the first example, the output ""blue green green green red"" corresponds to the inputs ""lug dax walm wif"", with ""dax"" correlating to the second green.
- In the second example, ""dax wif"" translates to ""green red,"" suggesting that ""dax"" means green.
- In the third example, ""lug dax wif lug"" translates to ""blue green red blue."" Here, ""dax"" again corresponds to green.
- In the fourth example, ""dax bluf zup bluf dax"" translates to ""green green yellow yellow green,"" indicating that both instances of ""dax"" mean green.
- In the fifth example, ""zup dax lug dax"" translates to ""yellow green blue green,"" which again points to ""dax"" representing green.

From these examples, it appears that regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the series of words, it consistently corresponds to the color green. Hence, the rule seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""wif"" consistently outputs the color ""red"" regardless of its position within the input sequence or the surrounding words. Therefore, we can deduce that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" 

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word 'zup' translates directly to the color 'yellow'. Each time 'zup' is used in the input, the term 'yellow' appears in the exact position in the output. There seems to be no dependence on context or position for the word 'zup' to mean 'yellow'. 

Rule: 'zup' -> 'yellow'
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the word that immediately precedes it (but in a different color). Let's examine the evidence:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"". ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""bluf"" repeats that color.
- In the second example, ""dax bluf wif"" becomes ""green green red"". Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""bluf"" repeats the green again before moving on to ""wif"", which is ""red"".
- In the third example, ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red"" again, confirming the pattern we've observed so far.
- In the fourth example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"". ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""bluf"" repeats that color once more.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf wif"" is ""yellow red"". The word ""bluf"" here takes the color from ""zup"", which is ""yellow"".

Therefore, based on these examples, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately before it and represents that color twice in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the previous word, displayed twice.
Using the examples provided, we can attempt to infer the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""walm.""

In the first example, ""lug walm zup"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow."" Here, ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of ""blue"" repeated three times. To confirm, let's look at other examples.

In the second example, ""walm"" appears between ""lug"" and ""wif"" and is followed by ""dax."" The corresponding output is two instances of ""blue"" and then a sequence of colors that do not include ""blue"" until ""dax,"" which is ""green."" This suggests that ""walm"" might relate to repeating the color that comes after it until a different color (or ""word"") appears.

In the third example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green."" Here, ""green"" follows ""walm"" and is repeated three times. If ""walm"" meant to repeat the following color three times, this would be consistent with our observation from the first example.

In the fourth example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" translates to a sequence that includes ""red red green green red red red blue red."" The ""walm"" here is followed by ""lug"" and then ""wif,"" where the color ""blue"" appears only once after the three ""reds,"" suggesting that ""walm"" caused ""blue"" to repeat once in this context based on its positioning.

In the final example, ""lug walm dax"" results in ""blue blue blue green."" ""Walm"" is surrounded by ""lug"" and ""dax,"" which correspond to ""blue"" and ""green"" respectively. ""Walm"" precedes the ""blue"" sequence and is followed by ""green.""

Combining our observations from the examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word just after ""walm"" to be repeated three times. It seems to act as a multiplier for the next color word.

Rule: walm -> causes the next color in the sequence to repeat three times.

This would mean for each sequence where ""walm"" is present:
- ""lug walm zup"" has the blue corresponding to ""lug"" repeated due to ""walm"" and then ""yellow"" for ""zup.""
- ""zup lug walm wif dax"" sees ""walm"" making ""blue,"" which comes after it for ""lug,"" repeated, before continuing with the sequence.
- ""dax walm"" has ""green"" repeated three times due to ""walm.""
- ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" is a bit more complex but since ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" but because ""lug"" comes immediately after ""walm,"" it causes ""blue"" to appear before continuing with ""red"" for ""wif.""
- ""lug walm dax"" simply repeats ""blue"" for ""lug"" because of ""walm"" before ending with ""green"" for ""dax.""

So: walm -> causes the next color word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif zup bluf
    ",Output: green red yellow yellow,green red yellow yellow,True,129
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each given example.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. The word 'dax' always corresponds to 'green' irrespective of its position in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the correlation between the inputs and outputs:

Input (I): wif lug
Output (O): red blue
- ""lug"" correlates with the color ""blue""
- ""wif"" is placed before ""lug"" and correlates with the color ""red""

I: zup lug walm wif walm
O: yellow blue blue blue red red red
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
- ""lug"" still correlates with a single ""blue""
- ""walm"" appears three times after ""wif"" and correlates with three ""red""
- It seems that one ""wif"" changes the following ""walm"" to triple its output from ""blue"" to ""red.""

I: wif lug dax walm
O: red blue green green green
- ""lug"" is blue
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green""
- ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and is ""green"" instead of ""blue"" or ""red,"" implying the ""wif"" effect on ""walm"" doesn't carry over past a different word in between.

I: lug wif bluf
O: blue red red
- ""lug"" and ""wif"" aren't followed by ""walm,"" so there is no color repetition.
- ""bluf"" is not preceded by a ""wif"" and correlates with a single ""red"" when following ""wif""

I: zup wif
O: yellow red
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
- ""wif"" has no word after it, and it correlates with ""red""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be that it correlates with the color ""red"" when it precedes a word. Additionally, when ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output for ""walm"" triples (changes from ""blue"" to three ""red""). However, this tripling effect is interrupted by a different word, as seen in Example 3.

Rule: wif -> translates into the color ""red."" When followed by ""walm,"" it causes the output for ""walm"" to be tripled in occurrences of the color ""red,"" unless the sequence is interrupted by another word.

Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in the output. There is no variation in the output every time ""zup"" appears in the input, regardless of its position or the words around it. Therefore, we can deduce that ""zup"" corresponds directly to the color yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word in the sequence. Here's how we can deduce this:

1. In the first example, ""zup wif bluf,"" the output is ""yellow red red."" We know zup is yellow and wif is red, so bluf seems to repeat the color of wif.

2. In the second example, ""zup bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow."" Bluf repeats the color of zup, which is yellow.

3. In the third example, ""wif zup dax bluf,"" the output is ""red yellow green green."" We can surmise that dax is green, and bluf repeats this color.

4. In the fourth example, ""wif dax zup bluf,"" the output is ""red green yellow yellow."" It confirms that bluf repeats the color of the preceding word, which in this case is zup (yellow).

5. In the fifth example, ""wif bluf,"" the output is ""red red."" Again, bluf repeats the color of wif, which is red.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word.
walm -> repeats the color of the word that precedes it three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the color associated with that word is repeated three times. For instance, ""dax"" corresponds to green, so ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"". Similarly, ""wif"" corresponds to red, so ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"". The word ""zup"" correlates with yellow, making ""zup walm"" yield ""yellow yellow yellow"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug bluf dax
    ",Output: blue blue green,blue blue green,True,130
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided:

zup lug -> yellow blue
lug zup -> blue yellow
lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue
lug wif bluf dax lug bluf -> blue red red green blue blue
zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

The word ""lug"" seems to be consistently translated as ""blue"" regardless of its position relative to other words.

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
Analyzing the input-output patterns, we can deduce the meaning of ""zup"" based on its placement within different strings of words and their corresponding color outputs.

Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""walm"" corresponds to blue, and since ""zup"" is the third word and the color changes, it is reasonable to infer that ""zup"" produces the color yellow.

Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
- The string starts with ""zup"" which gives yellow, ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""lug"" to blue, ""walm"" to blue again, followed by another ""zup"" which also produces yellow, and ""lug"" produces a blue.

Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
- ""zup"" starts and is followed by yellow, ""bluf"" does not have an established color but is followed by another yellow, suggesting ""bluf"" may be ""zup"" or has the same color output as ""zup"". ""lug"" corresponds to blue, followed by ""zup"" which is followed by yellow.

Input: wif zup dax bluf
Output: red yellow green green
- ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""zup"" to yellow, ""dax"" to green, and ""bluf"" also to green which suggests ""bluf"" is green.

Input: zup dax zup wif
Output: yellow green yellow red
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""dax"" to green, followed by another ""zup"" which is also yellow, and ""wif"" gives red.

From these examples, the rule for ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the sequence of words.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" aligns with the output color that directly precedes it in the input. By observing the corresponding output for each appearance of ""bluf,"" we can deduce the following pattern:

- ""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green"" means that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" when it follows ""dax.""
- ""dax lug bluf wif"" -> ""green blue blue red"" means that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" when it follows ""lug.""
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"" means that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" when it follows ""wif.""
- ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" -> ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red"" means that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" when it follows ""lug,"" and ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup.""
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"" again shows that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" when it follows ""wif.""

From the above, it is observed that ""bluf"" translates to the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color associated with the preceding word.
walm -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, ""walm"" translates to a repetition of three color words. The specific color word is contextually dependent on the word that precedes ""walm."" 

Rule:
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" so when ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the meaning is three repetitions of the word ""blue.""
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" so when ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the meaning is three repetitions of the word ""green.""
- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" as in ""zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" meaning that ""walm"" transforms into three repetitions of the word ""yellow.""

Therefore, ""walm"" seems to function as a modifier that, when combined with the preceding word, outputs a color word repeated three times, with the specific color being determined by the preceding word (e.g., ""lug"" for blue, ""dax"" for green, and ""zup"" for yellow).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,131
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""lug"" corresponds directly to the color ""blue"". Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output. There isn't enough context to determine if there are any other conditions or rules affecting ""lug,"" so the simplest assumption is a direct translation.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following mapping for words to colors:

bluf -> green
lug -> blue
zup -> yellow
wif -> red
walm -> green

Observe that regardless of the position in the input, each of the words maps consistently to the same color in the output. For the nonce word dax, we notice that it consistently maps to green in the output, regardless of its position or the other words in the input string.

Hence, the rule is:

dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word wif translates to the color red, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided:

1. ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow""
2. ""zup wif zup"" translates to ""yellow red yellow""
3. ""wif zup walm dax zup"" translates to ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow""
4. ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" translates to ""green green red yellow blue""
5. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" translates to ""blue red yellow red red red""

From these examples, I notice that every instance of ""zup"" in the input is translated to ""yellow"" in the output. I can then conclude:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" appears to result in repetition of the color word immediately preceding it. To confirm, let's review the examples with this rule in mind:

1. Input: lug wif lug bluf
   Output: blue red blue blue
   Analysis: ""lug"" before ""bluf"" is ""blue"", and after ""bluf"" is ""blue"".

2. Input: dax bluf wif lug
   Output: green green red blue
   Analysis: ""dax"" before ""bluf"" is ""green"", and after ""bluf"" is ""green"".

3. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue
   Analysis: ""lug"" before ""bluf"" is ""blue"", and after ""bluf"" is ""blue"".

4. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   Analysis: ""wif"" before ""bluf"" is ""red"", and after ""bluf"" is ""red"".

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   Analysis: ""zup"" before ""bluf"" is ""yellow"", which appears twice after ""bluf"", and ""lug walm"" is ""blue blue"", which is not immediately relevant to ""bluf"" since it doesn't follow the repetition pattern observed with ""bluf"".

Given these observations, the rule seems consistent:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> the color word preceding ""bluf"" is repeated.

Hence, ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the color mentioned just before it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can look at the patterns in the examples given:

- When ""dax"" is present, the output often starts with green.
- When ""lug"" is present, the output often starts with blue.
- When ""zup"" is present, the output often starts with yellow.
- When ""wif"" is present, the output contains red.
- When ""bluf"" is present, the corresponding output is blue.

Now, let's evaluate the examples involving ""walm"":

1. ""dax walm zup"" leads to ""green green green yellow""; ""walm"" seems to trigger an extra green before ending with the color for ""zup"" (yellow).
2. ""lug walm wif bluf"" results in ""blue blue blue red red""; here ""walm"" results in two additional blues, and then follows the pattern for ""wif"" (red) and ""bluf"" (blue).
3. ""dax wif walm"" produces ""green red red red""; “walm” here adds two more reds after ""wif"" has set the red color.
4. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" gives ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue""; ""walm"" introduces two additional yellows after ""zup"" before adopting the pattern for ""lug.""
5. ""zup bluf wif walm"" yields ""yellow yellow red red red""; ""walm"" adds an extra red after the pattern for ""wif.""

From these patterns, ""walm"" appears to repeat the color indicated by the word before it except in the first example where ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" yet it creates a repetition of the color that corresponds with ""dax,"" which is green.

Rule:
walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word except if preceded by ""dax,"" in which it may not relate directly to the word immediately before it but rather to the color associated with ""dax"" (green). 

However, since we only have one example with ""dax"" before ""walm,"" the specific rule for ""dax"" may need more examples to be more confidently deduced. Considering this, a possible general rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color output of the preceding word one or more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,132
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
From the given examples, we can infer that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the context or the words it is combined with. The other words, such as ""dax"" and ""wif,"" are each consistently translated to a different color (""green"" and ""red"" respectively) when they appear alongside ""lug.""

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Each occurrence of ""dax"" in the input is translated to ""green"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's examine its consistent presence in the examples provided:

1. lug wif => blue red
2. lug zup wif zup => blue yellow red yellow
3. wif walm dax zup => red red red green yellow
4. wif => red
5. wif walm dax => red red red green

Considering these examples, each time ""wif"" appears, the word ""red"" is included in the output. The position of ""wif"" does not seem to change the color it represents. Based on this consistency, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red

Therefore, ""wif"" means ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples given, the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Each instance of the word ""zup"" in the input results in ""yellow"" in the output. Additionally, it seems that other words correspond to different colors (""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""). Therefore, the rule is as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Analyzing the provided examples, let's try to deduce the meaning or rule behind the word ""bluf"":

- zup dax zup dax wif bluf -> yellow green yellow green red red
- lug wif bluf dax lug bluf -> blue red red green blue blue
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow
- zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
- dax bluf lug wif -> green green blue red

In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red red,"" which appears to be a repeated color following a sequence of other colors.

In the second example, ""bluf"" occurs twice, both times corresponding to ""blue.""

In the third, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output color is yellow, the same as ""zup.""

In the fourth, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output is green, which is the color corresponding to ""dax.""

In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and again the output for ""bluf"" is green, the color corresponding to ""dax,"" even though ""lug"" follows ""bluf"" and the output for ""lug"" is blue.

From these examples, we can derive the following rule: ""bluf"" results in a repetition of the output color of the immediately preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color output of the preceding word.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be associated with repeating the color that was just mentioned. This repetition of the color is consistent across all examples when the word ""walm"" is used. Each time ""walm"" is present, the color word that immediately precedes it is repeated a number of times equal to the total number of colors (including ""walm"") up to that point in the sequence.

Here are the examples broken down:

1. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" is yellow (mentioned once).
   - ""bluf"" is red (mentioned once).
   - ""wif"" comes just before 'walm' and is red.
   - ""walm"" results in red being repeated two more times for a total of three colors mentioned (including ""walm"").

2. lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - ""lug"" is blue (mentioned three times before ""walm"").
   - ""bluf"" is green (mentioned once).
   - ""dax"" is blue (mentioned once).
   - ""zup"" comes just before 'walm' and is yellow.
   - ""walm"" results in yellow being repeated two more times for a total of three colors (including ""walm"").
   - The final ""lug"" is blue and does not involve ""walm"".

3. dax walm -> green green green
   - ""dax"" is green.
   - ""walm"" results in green being repeated two more times for a total of three instances (including ""walm"").

4. zup lug walm wif walm -> yellow blue blue blue red red red
   - ""zup"" is yellow.
   - ""lug"" comes just before the first 'walm' and is blue.
   - The first ""walm"" causes blue to be repeated two more times for a total of three instances (including ""walm"").
   - ""wif"" comes just before the second 'walm' and is red.
   - The second ""walm"" causes red to be repeated two more times for a total of three instances (including ""walm"").

5. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" is yellow.
   - ""walm"" results in yellow being repeated two more times for a total of three instances (including ""walm"").

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning: Repeat the color word that immediately precedes it a number of times, with the total count equal to the number of colors mentioned up to ""walm"" in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow,yellow yellow yellow,True,133
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" is present in the input, ""blue"" is present in the output. Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the examples given and the colors associated with the words that follow ""dax.""

Examining the sequences and their outputs:

1. dax -> green
    zup -> yellow
    walm -> yellow
    wif -> red

2. dax -> green
    wif -> red

3. dax -> green
    bluf -> green
    wif -> red
    zup -> yellow
    wif -> red

4. dax -> green
    lug -> blue
    wif -> red

5. dax -> green
    wif -> red
    bluf -> red

From these sequences, we observe the following:

- ""dax"" invariably results in ""green.""
- The color following ""dax"" seems unrelated to the word that comes after ""dax,"" suggesting that ""dax"" itself induces the color ""green"" regardless of its position or the words that follow.
- Other words, like ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""walm,"" ""bluf,"" and ""lug,"" produce different colors, but the color ""red"" is consistent for ""wif"" regardless of its position.

Based on the given examples, the rule for ""dax"" is consistent in producing the color green. Other words seem to have their own associated colors, but for the purpose of this task, we are only concerned with the meaning of ""dax.""

Rule: dax -> green. The word ""dax"" always corresponds to the color ""green.""
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be a direct correlation between nonce words and specific color names:

- ""wif"" always corresponds to the output ""red.""
- ""zup"" when mentioned corresponds to the output ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""red.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green.""

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" is:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the examples given.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we must look for patterns in the examples provided:

1. In the first example, ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green."" Here, ""bluf"" corresponds with the second ""red.""

2. In the second example, ""wif bluf lug"" results in ""red red blue."" Similarly, ""bluf"" matches up with the second ""red.""

3. The third example, ""zup bluf dax lug,"" translates to ""yellow yellow green blue."" Again, ""bluf"" aligns with the second ""yellow.""

4. In the fourth example, ""wif bluf lug zup"" becomes ""red red blue yellow."" ""Bluf"" is linked with the second ""red.""

5. Finally, the fifth example, ""wif bluf zup bluf wif,"" corresponds to ""red red yellow yellow red."" Both instances of ""bluf"" match up with either the second ""red"" or the second ""yellow.""

Analyzing these examples, we can establish a pattern: The word ""bluf"" always corresponds to a color, and it always matches the color of the word immediately preceding it. It seems that ""bluf"" is a placeholder for ""repeat the previous color.""

Rule: bluf -> repeat the previous color.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in the input and their corresponding outputs.

- ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" must therefore have a pattern resulting in ""blue blue.""
- ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" translates to ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow."" In this instance, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" The only unaccounted for output is the ""yellow yellow yellow"" at the end, which corresponds to ""walm.""
- ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" yields ""blue blue blue red blue blue,"" where once again, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" has not been previously defined but gives an output ""blue"" which is consistent with ""lug."" Thus, ""walm"" corresponds with ""blue blue.""
- ""lug walm"" gives ""blue blue blue."" We've compared ""lug"" to ""blue"" earlier, so ""walm"" again results in ""blue blue.""
- ""zup wif walm"" turns into ""yellow red red red."" From prior examples, ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""wif"" is ""red."" The word ""walm"" here corresponds with ""red red.""

So, ""walm"" seems to duplicate the color of the word immediately preceding it, producing that color twice in succession in the output.

Rule: walm -> meaning. Meaning: walm duplicates the color associated with the word immediately before it in the output, resulting in that color being outputted twice.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided:

- ""zup dax zup lug"" corresponds to ""yellow green yellow blue""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""lug dax"" corresponds to ""blue green""
- ""wif lug"" corresponds to ""red blue""
- ""lug dax"" corresponds to ""blue green""

It can be deduced that every single instance of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" correlates to the color ""green"". Here is the rule induction based on the input and output pairs given:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green"".
- The appearance of ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in repeated ""green"" corresponding to the number of times ""walm"" appears after ""dax"".
- Other words like ""wif"" and ""zup"" seem to correspond to other colors, ""red"" and ""yellow"" respectively. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green

This indicates that ""dax"" refers to the color green, irrespective of its position or the context in which it is used.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Each occurrence of the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the outputs provided.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"". Here's how it breaks down:

1. In the first example, ""zup bluf dax lug"" becomes ""yellow yellow green blue"". The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue.

2. In the second example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"". This doesn't specifically help with the word ""bluf"" but it does establish that ""wif"" corresponds to red, which is consistent in other examples.

3. In the third example, ""zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue"", reinforcing the association of ""bluf"" with blue.

4. In the fourth example, ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red"". Here, ""zup"" means yellow, and ""wif"" means red. This reinforces earlier observations but does not add new information about ""bluf"".

5. The fifth example, ""lug wif lug dax bluf"", translates to ""blue red blue green green"". The only new word before the colors change is ""bluf"", which again corresponds with the color blue.

From these examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> blue.
From the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it, three times. Here's the breakdown:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"", suggesting ""walm"" causes the color associated with ""lug"" (blue) to be repeated three times.
- ""lug wif walm"" results in ""blue red red red"", where ""wif"" is associated with ""red"", and ""walm"" causes it to be repeated three times.
- ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" results in ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". The word ""zup"" is before ""walm"" and corresponds to ""yellow"", so ""walm"" causes it to repeat three times.
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow red red red"" with ""wif"" before ""walm"" being associated with ""red"" and repeated three times.
- ""dax walm"" gives ""green green green"", indicating that ""dax"" is green, and ""walm"" has caused it to be repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the next color word to repeat three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
From the examples provided, we can infer the following patterns:

- Every instance of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- Every instance of ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- Every instance of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- Every instance of ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue.""
- Every instance of ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Given these patterns, we can deduce that ""dax"" essentially means ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided:

- Input ""dax lug wif"" corresponds to ""green blue red"".
- Input ""wif"" alone corresponds to ""red"".
- Input ""lug wif walm"" corresponds to ""blue red red red"".
- Input ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red"".
- Input ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red blue green"".

From these examples, we can infer that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red"", regardless of the other words (or nonce words) that accompany it. Thus, the meaning of ""wif"" is not influenced by position or surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can analyze the pattern by examining each instance of ""zup"" and its corresponding output. 

In each of the examples, ""zup"" always corresponds to the output ""yellow."" Here's the breakdown:

- Example 1: ""zup wif walm lug"" -> ""yellow red red red blue""
- Example 2: ""lug dax zup"" -> ""blue green yellow""
- Example 3: ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow blue yellow yellow""
- Example 4: ""zup dax lug"" -> ""yellow green blue""
- Example 5: ""dax wif zup dax"" -> ""green red yellow green""

In each case, irrespective of the position of ""zup"" amongst other nonce words, it correlates with ""yellow."" There's no indication that the meaning of ""zup"" changes based on context or its position in the input string.

Given the consistent mapping in all examples, we can induce that:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
Analyzing the inputs and outputs, we can see that each time the word ""bluf"" appears, the output is a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word that immediately follows ""bluf"". For instance, in the first example, ""wif bluf zup bluf wif"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". When ""bluf"" is followed by these words, ""red"" and ""yellow"" are repeated.

Let's solidify this with the given examples:

Example 1:
- wif bluf zup bluf wif
- red red yellow yellow red

Example 2:
- lug bluf wif
- blue blue red

Example 3:
- wif bluf lug zup
- red red blue yellow

Example 4:
- wif lug zup bluf
- red blue yellow yellow

Example 5:
- zup bluf
- yellow yellow

As we can see from these examples, the rule seems clear:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the next word. If there is no next word, repeat the color that corresponds to the last word before ""bluf"".
walm -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" can be deduced as follows:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green,"" where the word ""dax"" is known to correspond to the color ""green."" This suggests that ""walm"" could mean ""repeat the previous color.""

- When ""lug"" and ""wif"" precede ""walm"" in the second example (""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug""), the output is ""blue blue red blue red red red blue."" Since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" the appearance of ""walm"" here leads to repeating the color ""red"" three times, which corresponds to the number of times ""wif"" appears before it.

- In the third example (""lug walm""), the output is ""blue blue blue,"" which reinforces the rule that ""walm"" repeats the color mentioned directly before it, in this case, ""blue"" from ""lug.""

- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" in the fourth example (""wif walm zup""), the output is ""red red red yellow."" This indicates that ""walm"" repeats the color ""red"" three times because ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

- In the fifth example (""zup wif dax walm lug""), ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the series ""green green green"" is produced. ""Lug"" then translates to ""blue."" This supports the idea that ""walm"" repeats the color before it.

Rule: ""walm"" causes the previous color word's corresponding color to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,136
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.
Examining the given examples and their corresponding outputs, we can attempt to determine the rule underlying the word ""dax."" Let's look at each example:

- In the first example, ""dax"" precedes ""zup lug wif lug"" and the output is ""green yellow blue red blue."" Since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in both of its appearances, and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" we can rule out a one-to-one correspondence for ""zup."" ""Zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow"" even though it only appears once.
  
- In the second example, ""dax walm zup lug walm"" corresponds to ""green green green yellow blue blue blue."" Here, ""walm"" appears twice, and for each occurrence, there are two ""greens"" in the output. This could suggest that ""walm"" corresponds to two repetitions of ""green,"" indicating a doubling rule.
  
- In the third example, ""dax lug dax"" corresponds to ""green blue green,"" suggesting that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" consistently, as ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
  
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" on its own corresponds to ""green.""

- In the fifth example, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" which fits with the previous doubling rule suggested by the appearance of ""walm.""

From these observations, we can deduce that ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green."" There is no context where ""dax"" correlates with any output other than ""green."" Therefore, we can conclude the following:

Rule: dax -> green. This means ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs given in the examples.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that:

- When the input includes just ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""
- When the input includes ""wif"" alongside other words such as ""zup,"" ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" or ""walm,"" the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.

Each of the other words corresponds to a unique color: for example, ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and so on.

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" based on the given examples is that ""wif"" translates directly to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the preceding nonce word. 

For example:
- ""dax"" is associated with the color green, so ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green"".
- ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow, so ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"". 
- If more than one color precedes ""bluf"", only the color associated with the directly preceding nonce word is repeated.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the immediately preceding word. This is evident as each time ""walm"" is used, the output is a repetition of the color generated by the previous word.

Here are the specific rules we can deduce from each line of your examples:

1. ""lug walm wif zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue red yellow red""
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and the output is ""blue blue,"" indicating repetition.

2. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and the output is ""yellow yellow,"" indicating repetition.

3. ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red""
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and the output is ""yellow yellow,"" indicating repetition.

4. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and the output is ""blue blue blue,"" indicating repetition.

5. ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue""
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and the output is ""blue blue blue,"" indicating repetition.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color code of the immediately preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug
    ",Output: green blue,green blue,True,137
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule:
The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in every instance.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Each instance of ""dax"" in the input is translated to ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position or the presence of surrounding words.

Rule: dax -> green.
From the examples given, we can attempt to induce the rule by looking at the pattern of colors corresponding to the words.

- ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" is translated to ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow""
- ""wif"" on its own results in ""red""
- ""dax walm wif walm"" results in ""green green green red red red""
- ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" results in ""green yellow red red blue""
- ""dax wif"" gives us ""green red""

Assuming ""dax,"" ""walm,"" ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""bluf"" each correspond to the colors ""green,"" ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" ""yellow,"" and ""blue"" respectively, as seen where they are the solitary word or the immediate repetition of the word reflects the immediate repetition of the color, the word ""wif"" seems to correspond with ""red.""

Additionally, we can see a pattern where ""wif"" appears to generate multiple ""red"" outputs when preceded or followed by certain other words. The number of ""red"" outputs seems to match the total number of words following ""wif,"" including ""wif"" itself, up until a new word that has a different corresponding color is introduced or the sequence ends.

Let's describe it in terms of the rule:

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"", and it induces a sequence of ""red"" that matches the number of immediately following words until a word with a different color output is encountered or the sequence terminates.

Using these observations, we define:

wif -> red 

When isolated or followed by other words without an intervening word that maps to a different color, the number of ""red"" outputs corresponds to the number of occurrences of ""wif"" plus the number of following words, stopping at a word that translates to a different color.

Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Here is the breakdown of the examples:

- wif lug bluf wif zup -> red blue blue red yellow
- zup wif -> yellow red
- dax zup dax -> green yellow green
- lug walm zup lug walm -> blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
- zup dax -> yellow green

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" based on these examples is:

zup -> yellow. 

Rule: ""zup"" translates to the word ""yellow"".
Analyzing each instance where the word ""bluf"" is used and its corresponding output:

1. wif bluf lug dax wif -> red red blue green red
2. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
3. dax zup wif bluf lug -> green yellow red red blue
4. zup bluf wif lug dax -> yellow yellow red blue green
5. wif bluf dax -> red red green

Looking at the patterns, whenever the word ""bluf"" appears, the color ""red"" directly follows in the output, with one exception: in the first line, ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue."" The context of ""bluf"" also does not seem to change its output— ""bluf"" always corresponds to either ""red"" or ""blue,"" regardless of the words around it. It looks like ""bluf"" correlates with ""red,"" but it does not explain why it is ""blue"" in the first example. There is no visible pattern that links ""bluf"" to ""green,"" ""yellow,"" or any other colors.

This irregularity in the first example could be a result of a mistake or there might be an additional rule not apparent from the given data. However, assuming no mistake in the dataset, it is necessary to find an explanation for the first instance. A potential pattern could be positional, where ""bluf"" takes the color value of ""blue"" if it is preceded by another specific word or in a specific position.

Given that the first line is the only instance where ""bluf"" outputs ""blue,"" and it occurs right after the word ""lug,"" we might deduce that ""bluf"" usually means ""red,"" but when it follows ""lug"" it means ""blue.""

However, in the third example ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and yet it outputs ""red."" Thus, it's unclear why it corresponds to ""blue"" in the first instance. With the available data, the safest interpretation for ""bluf"" consistently is ""red,"" assuming that the irregularity observed may be due to an error or an unknown contextual rule.

Rule: bluf -> red
Based on the given input and output pairs, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color word that follows it three times. In cases where there is no color word following ""walm"", it repeats the previous color word three times. Here's the observed rule applied to each example:

1. ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue blue"". Here, ""walm"" results in the repetition of ""blue"" three times because ""lug"" means blue.
2. ""lug walm zup walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow"". In this case, ""walm"" first causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times, then it causes ""yellow"" to be repeated three times after ""zup"".
3. ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"". Here, ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times as ""wif"" means red.
4. ""dax wif walm lug zup"" translates to ""green red red red blue yellow"". ""Walm"" in this instance results in ""red"" being repeated three times following ""wif"".
5. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"". At the end of the sequence, ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which means ""yellow"", so it repeats ""yellow"" three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the immediate preceding color word to be repeated three times. If walm is followed by a color word, it repeats that color instead.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup dax
    ",Output: red yellow green,red yellow green,True,138
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"", regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the rule for the word ""dax,"" we will analyze the provided inputs and their corresponding outputs.

- In the first and second input-output pairs, ""dax wif"" consistently corresponds to ""green red."" 
- In the third pair, ""lug dax wif lug"" translates to ""blue green red blue,"" which suggests that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and the ordering of ""dax"" and ""wif"" is preserved as ""green"" and ""red,"" respectively.
- In the fourth example, ""dax zup wif"" corresponds to ""green yellow red."" Since ""dax"" precedes ""zup"" and ""wif,"" and knowing that ""dax"" relates to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red"" from the previous examples, it can be inferred that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax zup"" translates to ""green yellow,"" which is consistent with the above deductions.

So, analyzing all the correlations between the input nonce words and their respective output color terms, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" seems to consistently correspond to the color ""red"" in the output. This is evident from the following observations:

1. When ""wif"" appears alone in the input, the output is ""red"".
2. When ""wif"" appears alongside ""lug"", which corresponds to ""blue"", the sequence ""wif lug"" leads to ""red blue"".
3. In a longer sequence involving ""lug"" and ""wif"", such as ""lug wif lug"", the output matches each input term with its color ""blue red blue"".
4. Additionally, in the input ""zup wif lug wif"", where ""zup"" is another nonce word that corresponds to ""yellow"", ""wif"" continues to correspond to ""red"".

Therefore, based on these examples, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" appears to be:

wif -> red

Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in each given example, regardless of its position or surrounding context.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can look at the patterns in the input and their corresponding outputs. Let us examine each pair to understand the rule.

Input: wif zup bluf
Output: red yellow yellow

In this example, the word ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" ""zup"" maps to the first ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" maps to the second ""yellow.""

Input: wif bluf zup
Output: red red yellow

Here, the output shifts such that ""wif"" still maps to ""red,"" ""bluf"" now maps to ""red"" instead of ""yellow,"" and ""zup"" remains ""yellow.""

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

The word ""wif"" remains ""red,"" ""bluf"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is the first ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it, resulting in two more ""green.""

Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red

""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""bluf"" is ""red.""

Input: wif bluf dax lug
Output: red red green blue

""wif"" is ""red,"" ""bluf"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue.""

From these examples, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be context-dependent. Specifically, ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it. For example, when ""wif"" (red) comes before ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is also ""red."" When another color would precede ""bluf,"" it would take on that color as well.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the word before it in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's take a look at the patterns in the given examples:

- In the first example, the input ""zup wif dax walm"" corresponds to the output ""yellow red green green green."" The nonce word ""walm"" is associated with three ""green"" colors at the end.
  
- In the second example, ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" and is associated with three ""yellow"" colors.
  
- The third example provides the input ""dax lug walm zup wif"" and the corresponding output ""green blue blue blue yellow red."" The ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and ""dax"" and precedes ""zup"" and ""wif,"" again resulting in three ""blue"" colors.

- The fourth example is ""zup lug walm,"" with the output ""yellow blue blue blue."" The word ""walm"" is associated with three ""blue"" colors following ""lug.""

- Finally, in the fifth example ""wif dax lug walm,"" the output is ""red green blue blue blue."" The nonce word ""walm"" follows ""lug"" again and results in three ""blue"" colors.

The pattern suggests that ""walm"" is associated with a triplet of colors. The rule seems to be influenced by the word that immediately precedes ""walm."" Specifically, if ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the resulting color is blue. There is one instance of ""dax"" preceding ""walm"" that resulted in a ""green"" triplet, but ""walm"" is not directly after ""dax."" In the second example where ""walm"" stands alone followed by ""lug,"" it results in a ""yellow"" triplet. There is not enough information to define a clear rule for when ""walm"" stands alone without ""lug"" following it, but we can tentatively say that ""lug"" before ""walm"" significantly influences the outcome to be blue.

Rule: When ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output is three times the color corresponding to ""lug"" which is blue. Without sufficient examples of ""walm"" standing alone or followed by other words, it is difficult to conclusively define a rule for those cases.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax wif dax
    ","Based on the rules deduced from the examples provided:

- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word before it in the sequence
- ""walm"" follows the rule that when ""lug"" precedes it, the result is three times the color corresponding to ""lug,"" which is ""blue"". However, in the absence of ""lug"" preceding it and without additional examples, the exact behavior is unclear.

Nonetheless, using these rules to parse the input ""wif dax wif dax"" results in:

- ""wif"" is ""red""
- ""dax"" is ""green""
- The second ""wif"" is ""red""
- The second ""dax"" is ""green""

Therefore, the input ""wif dax wif dax"" would result in the output of corresponding colors ""red green red green.""

Output: red green red green",red green red green,True,139
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue in the outputs. We notice that other words are associated with different colors as well: ""wif"" corresponds with red, ""bluf"" with blue (redundant with ""lug"" in this context), ""dax"" with green, and ""zup"" with yellow.

Therefore, we can infer the following rule: 

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" seems to correspond to the color ""green."" When ""dax"" is presented alone or with other non-color words, the output remains consistently “green.”

However, alongside ""dax,"" other words appear to be triggering outputs that are colors as well:

- ""wif"" produces ""red""
- ""zup"" produces ""yellow""
- ""walm"" does not have a consistent color representation in the examples, but seems to cause the repetition of the color produced by the word before it. In the provided example, ""walm"" is after ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" so the color ""yellow"" is repeated after ""walm.""

As such, the rule seems to be:
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is combined with other specific words, those words correspond to their respective colors.
- The word ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color word directly before it.

Therefore, the rule is: dax -> green. Other words trigger their respective color output, while ""walm"" repeats the previous color.
Based on the input and output pairs provided, we can infer the following color associations for each of the nonce words:

- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- walm -> green (it's repeated three times consecutively in the last example)

Now, looking at the context of where 'wif' appears, it always translates to 'red.' Therefore, it doesn't seem to depend on context, position in the sequence, or any other visible factors. Each appearance of 'wif' corresponds to the word 'red'.

wif -> red. Rule: 'wif' consistently means 'red' irrespective of context or position.
Given the provided examples, we can analyze the input and output pairs to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""zup."" We need to consider the instances where ""zup"" is present and determine what it corresponds to in the output:

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
- Here we see that ""zup"" directly maps to ""yellow"". However, since ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""yellow"", we need more information to differentiate if ""zup"" has a unique translation or is context-dependent.

Input: dax zup lug bluf
Output: green yellow blue blue
- ""dax"" maps to ""green"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""bluf"" to ""blue"" again. Here ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"", consistent with the first example.

Input: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup
Output: blue blue red blue blue yellow
- ""lug"" and ""bluf"" consistently map to ""blue"", ""wif"" maps to ""red"", and ""zup"" again appears to correspond to ""yellow"" at the end.

Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow
- ""dax"" maps to ""green"", ""walm"" to ""green"" again, and ""zup"" to ""yellow"".

Input: dax wif zup dax
Output: green red yellow green
- Both instances of ""dax"" map to ""green"", ""wif"" maps to ""red"", and ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"".

Based on these observations, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of a nonce word like ""bluf,"" we should consider the common factor in all outputs when ""bluf"" is present in the input. Let's analyze each occurrence:

1. Input: ""dax wif bluf"" -> Output: ""green red red""
2. Input: ""wif bluf dax lug"" -> Output: ""red red green blue""
3. Input: ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" -> Output: ""red yellow yellow red green""
4. Input: ""zup bluf dax lug"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow green blue""
5. Input: ""wif zup dax bluf"" -> Output: ""red yellow green green""

In each case ""bluf"" occurs, the word that comes after ""bluf"" in the input list gets translated to ""green"" in the output list. If there's no word after ""bluf,"" like in Example 1, we can't use this pattern. But for the rest of the examples, it holds up. So, based on the available data, the rule seems to be:

Rule: When ""bluf"" occurs in the input, the output for the next word is ""green,"" regardless of what that next word is.

Bluf -> makes the following word produce the output ""green"".
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the consistent patterns across the examples:

1. ""wif walm zup"" translates to ""red red red yellow,"" and ""wif"" alone corresponds to ""red."" Thus, ""walm"" in this context also means ""red.""
   
2. ""lug walm zup"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow,"" and ""lug"" alone equals ""blue."" So, here, ""walm"" again corresponds to ""blue.""

3. ""wif dax lug walm"" translates to ""red green blue blue blue."" We know that ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug"" correspond to ""red,"" ""green,"" and ""blue,"" respectively. ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" and is also translated to ""blue.""

4. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""walm"" is also ""green"" in this context.

5. ""dax zup walm wif walm"" translates to ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red."" Each instance of ""walm"" follows a color that's repeated three times.

From these examples, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it. If there is no preceding color, as in the case of #4 (""dax walm""), it seems to take the meaning of the color associated with the word just before it, which in example #4 was ""dax"" corresponding to ""green"".

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" represents a repetition of the color denoted by the immediately preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, ""lug"" always corresponds to the color ""blue."" Each appearance of ""lug"" in the input results in ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position or the other words present.

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
From these examples, the rule appears to be that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" This is consistent in every example where ""wif"" directly translates to ""red"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples given:

- wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
- zup wif -> yellow red
- zup -> yellow
- zup -> yellow
- wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow

It appears that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" irrespective of its position in the sequence or the words around it. 

Rule: zup -> yellow.
From the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" appears to trigger a repeat of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here's the analysis based on the examples:

1. ""zup dax bluf"" -> yellow green green; ""dax"" corresponds to green, followed by ""bluf,"" which repeats the green.
2. ""lug bluf"" -> blue blue; ""lug"" corresponds to blue, followed by ""bluf,"" which repeats the blue.
3. ""dax bluf zup bluf dax"" -> green green yellow yellow green; ""dax"" (green) is followed by ""bluf"" (repeats green), ""zup"" (yellow) followed by ""bluf"" (repeats yellow), then ""dax"" again (green).
4. ""dax bluf wif"" -> green green red; ""dax"" (green) followed by ""bluf"" (repeats green), then ""wif"" (red).
5. ""wif bluf zup bluf wif"" -> red red yellow yellow red; ""wif"" (red) is followed by ""bluf"" (repeats red), ""zup"" (yellow) followed by ""bluf"" (repeats yellow), then ""wif"" again (red).

Rule:
bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the correspondence between the input and output sequences. Here's the breakdown of inputs and their respective outputs:

1. lug walm -> blue blue blue
2. wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
3. lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
4. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
5. lug dax walm wif -> blue green green green red

Looking at the sequences, here's what we can infer about other words:
- lug seems to correspond to blue, as it always produces ""blue"" in the output.
- zup seems to correspond to yellow, as it always produces ""yellow"" in the output.
- wif seems to correspond to red, as it always produces ""red"" in the output.

When ""walm"" appears in the sequence, it seems to repeat the color word that precedes it three times.

Using this information, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"":
Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color word, it repeats that word's corresponding color three times in the output.

Therefore:
walm -> meaning: Repeat the preceding color word's corresponding color output three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,141
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue each time it is used. The output is consistently ""blue"" whenever ""lug"" is mentioned:

- ""lug wif bluf lug wif"" -> ""blue red red blue red"" (note that ""lug"" is always output as ""blue"")
- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"" (the repetition suggests that ""walm"" might also mean ""blue"" but we have no example where ""walm"" is used alone to confirm that)
- ""zup lug"" -> ""yellow blue"" (here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"")

Rule: lug -> blue
Analyzing the provided input and output pairs, we can deduce a correlation between the non-English words in the input and the color words in the output. To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at each instance where it appears in the input and the corresponding color in the output:

1. Input: ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" 
   Output: ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue""
   
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green"" in the output.

2. Input: ""dax lug wif""
   Output: ""green blue red""
   
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" again.

3. Input: ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm""
   Output: ""green red yellow yellow red red red""
   
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" once more.

4. Input: ""wif zup dax""
   Output: ""red yellow green""
   
   ""dax"" follows ""zup"" and corresponds to ""green"" again.

5. Input: ""wif bluf lug dax wif""
   Output: ""red red blue green red""
   
   ""dax"" comes after ""lug"" and translates to ""green.""

From all the above examples, we can establish that regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words, ""dax"" consistently corresponds with the color ""green"" in the output. Therefore, the meaning of ""dax"" is ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the output color depends on the associated input word, with each word translated to a specific color. However, when the word ""wif"" is included, there is an additional ""red"" in the output. We can infer that ""wif"" triggers the addition of the color ""red"" to the sequence. 

To confirm this, we can check across all examples:

- zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red (Without ""wif"": yellow yellow red)
- zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red (Without ""wif"": yellow yellow yellow blue red)
- lug wif lug -> blue red blue (Without ""wif"": blue blue)
- dax wif -> green red (Without ""wif"": green)
- wif dax bluf -> red green green (Without ""wif"": green green)

In each case, the presence of ""wif"" in the input directly adds one instance of ""red"" to the output sequence that would be expected without ""wif."" It appears independently of the order of words, so it's not dependent on a preceding or following word to exist in the output.

Rule: wif -> The presence of ""wif"" in the input adds ""red"" to the output color sequence.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of the context in which it appears.
bluf -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: 

In each input, when the word ""bluf"" is present, it corresponds with an output of ""red blue"" (two words). 

The other words in the input correspond with a single color in the output: ""wif"" corresponds with ""red"", ""dax"" corresponds with ""green"", ""walm"" corresponds with ""green"", ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue"", and ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow"".

So, bluf corresponds to the output sequence ""red blue"". This indicates that ""bluf"" means two consecutive colors ""red"" followed by ""blue"".
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the relationship between the input and the output in each example.

In the first example, ""dax lug dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue green blue blue blue."" Since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" the addition of ""walm"" at the end resulted in two extra ""blue"" in the output.

The second example, ""lug wif walm,"" produces ""blue red red red"" as output. Since ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""wif"" is ""red,"" the presence of ""walm"" has added two additional ""red"" in the output.

The third example, ""wif dax lug walm,"" gives ""red green blue blue blue."" Here, each of ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""green,"" and ""blue,"" respectively. ""Walm"" then seems to produce two extra ""blue.""

The fourth example, ""zup wif dax walm lug,"" has an output of ""yellow red green green green blue."" Each input word corresponds to a color, and the presence of ""walm"" is followed by two extra ""green.""

The fifth example, ""wif walm lug bluf,"" translates to ""red red red blue blue."" Since ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" also seems to correspond to ""blue,"" we can focus on ""walm,"" which again results in two extra occurrences of the color directly preceding it (""red"" in this case).

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" is that it seems to double the color that directly precedes it in the input sequence.

Rule: walm -> Doubles the preceding color in the output sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug zup
    ",Output: green blue yellow,green blue yellow,True,142
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
From the provided examples, it seems that the word ""lug"" represents the color ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

lug -> blue
Rule: The word ""lug"" signifies the color ""blue.""
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""dax"" seems to correspond to the color ""green."" Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. The other words in the examples (""lug"", ""wif"", ""bluf"", ""zup"", ""walm"") are associated with different colors (""blue"", ""red"", ""blue"", ""yellow"", ""green"" respectively), but the term ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green.""

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, where the input is a series of words and the output is a series of colors, we need to determine the color that corresponds to the nonce word ""wif"". By examining the inputs and their respective outputs, we can try to discern a pattern:

1. ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" -> ""green blue yellow red red green""
2. ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" -> ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow""
3. ""zup walm wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow red""
4. ""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red""
5. ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green yellow red green green""

By cross-referencing each input with its output, we can see that every time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the same position in the output. Therefore, it is reasonable to deduce that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns in each example.

From the first example:

- dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> green blue yellow red red green

Here, ""bluf"" appears before a repeated ""dax,"" and the output is ""red"" followed by ""green,"" which is the color associated with ""dax.""

From the second example:

- dax bluf wif lug -> green green red blue

The word ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""wif,"" with the output colors being ""green red.""

From the third example:

- dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow

Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is two ""yellow"" colors, showing that ""bluf"" might be taking the color of the word it follows.

From the fourth example:

- zup wif bluf zup -> yellow red red yellow

""Bluf"" is in between ""wif"" and ""zup,"" and its corresponding output color is ""red,"" the same as ""wif.""

From the fifth example:

- dax bluf wif zup wif -> green green red yellow red

In this example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and ""wif"" follows ""bluf."" The corresponding output color for ""bluf"" is ""green,"" the same as ""dax.""

Based on the examples, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color of the immediately preceding word. Hence, the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" is that it takes on the color of the word that appears directly before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word.
From the examples provided, we can infer that the word ""walm"" causes the output of the following word to be tripled based on some color-coded rule. To deduce the rule for the color association, we can analyze the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. lug walm -> blue blue blue
2. dax walm wif -> green green green red
3. dax walm wif walm zup -> green green green red red red yellow
4. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
5. wif lug dax walm -> red blue green green green

With this information, we can establish the following associations:
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red

Given these associations, ""walm"" appears to take the color of the word it follows and triples its output.

Rule: walm -> Triples the color associated with the word that precedes it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup walm
    ",Output: green yellow yellow yellow,green yellow yellow yellow,True,143
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.
dax -> meaning. The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" is included in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red"". Each time ""wif"" appears in an input, the output includes a ""red"". When it appears more than once in sequence as in ""wif walm"", it results in repeating ""red"" for the number of times ""walm"" follows ""wif"". This pattern holds true irrespective of the position of ""wif"" in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" is associated with a consistent output, irrespective of its position in the input string or the presence of other words. Whenever ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow"". Therefore, the rule appears to be:

zup -> yellow

Meaning that the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
The examples suggest that the word ""bluf"" in each input corresponds directly to the color that is listed last in the output sequence. In each case, the color mentioned at the end of the output is not red or yellow, and it is the same as the color that precedes it. Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it stands for the word that represents the color preceding it. 

Given the examples, we can see that:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue"" in the output, and the word preceding ""bluf"" is ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is once again followed by the word ""red,"" which corresponds to the preceding word ""wif.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow,"" which corresponds to the preceding word ""zup.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""green,"" which corresponds to the preceding word ""dax.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" once more, which aligns with the preceding word ""dax.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> the color represented by the word immediately preceding ""bluf.""
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" affects the outcomes in a specific way. It seems to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it. Here’s the breakdown of the rule:

- Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
  Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
  Explanation: ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which translates to ""yellow"", so it repeats ""yellow"".

- Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
  Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
  Explanation: ""walm"" first follows ""wif"" which is ""red"", hence ""walm"" becomes ""red"". The second ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which is ""blue"", so it becomes ""blue"".

- Input: dax lug walm
  Output: green blue blue blue
  Explanation: ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which is ""blue"", hence ""walm"" repeats ""blue"".

- Input: lug wif walm
  Output: blue red red red
  Explanation: ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which is ""red"", and so ""walm"" repeats ""red"".

- Input: wif lug walm
  Output: red blue blue blue
  Explanation: ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which is ""blue"", so ""walm"" repeats ""blue"".

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" means to repeat the color word that comes immediately before it in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,144
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce a pattern between the input and the output. The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Here is the correlation based on the input-output pairings:

1. ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue""
2. ""zup dax lug"" -> ""yellow green blue""
3. ""lug wif lug"" -> ""blue red blue""
4. ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue""
5. ""zup wif lug"" -> ""yellow red blue""

The word before ""lug"" seems to correspond to another color: ""wif"" to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The additional word ""dax"" in the second input seems to correspond to ""green."" 

When ""lug"" appears more than once in the input, its corresponding output color of ""blue"" is repeated for each occurrence. 

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the examples provided:

- Every time 'dax' is mentioned, the output is 'green'.
- The output 'green' is consistent regardless of the position of 'dax' within the input sequence.

From this, we can induce that 'dax' corresponds to the color 'green'.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples given:

Input: lug dax wif -> Output: blue green red
Input: wif -> Output: red
Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm -> Output: green green green red blue green green green
Input: dax wif dax zup bluf -> Output: green red green yellow yellow
Input: wif -> Output: red

The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the word ""red"" irrespective of its position or surrounding words in the sequence. Therefore, the rule appears simply to be:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" means ""red"".
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Every instance when ""zup"" was mentioned, regardless if it was at the beginning, middle, or end of a sequence, the output was ""yellow.""

For the additional words, we can deduce the following:
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" except in the fifth example where it appears twice in sequence and translates to ""blue blue,"" and then follows ""zup,"" so the pattern could be repeating the ""lug"" color, except when it follows the word ""zup.""
- ""walm"" is a bit unclear as it only appears once, but it also translates to ""blue"" in that instance. 

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" translates to a color, and the color it translates to depends on the word that comes immediately before it. This is rule induction derived from the outputs correlating with varying inputs:

- When ""lug"" comes before ""bluf"" the output color is blue.
- When ""zup"" comes before ""bluf"", the output color is yellow.
- When ""dax"" comes before ""bluf"", the output color is green.
- There is no example provided with ""wif"" or ""walm"" directly before ""bluf"", but these words correspond to red and red, respectively, in other instances.

It is possible that the word, ""bluf"" refers to the color that the preceding word represents, essentially a repetition of the last color mentioned.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> takes the color value of the word immediately preceding it.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Let's investigate each example:

In the first example:
- zup walm -> yields ""yellow yellow""
- lug zup -> yields ""blue yellow""
- zup wif -> yields ""yellow red""
- wif dax -> yields ""red green""
Here, ""walm"" immediately follows ""zup"" which outputs ""yellow,"" so ""walm"" takes the color yellow.

In the second example:
- wif lug -> yields ""red blue""
- lug walm -> yields ""blue blue""
Here, ""walm"" immediately follows ""lug,"" which outputs ""blue,"" so ""walm"" takes the color blue.

In the third example:
- wif walm -> yields ""red red""
- walm dax -> yields ""red green""
- dax zup -> yields ""green yellow""
Again, ""walm"" takes on the color of ""wif,"" which is red.

In the fourth example:
- dax walm -> yields ""green green""
- walm zup -> yields ""green yellow""
- zup lug -> yields ""yellow blue""
- lug walm -> yields ""blue blue""
Consistently, ""walm"" takes on the color of the preceding word.

In the fifth example:
- wif walm -> yields ""red red""
- walm zup -> yields ""red yellow""
Here, after ""wif,"" which is red, ""walm"" also takes the color red.

So the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" in these examples appears to be:

Rule: walm -> Takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup
    ",Output: blue yellow,blue yellow,True,145
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following rule for the nonce word ""lug"":

Rule: lug -> blue

Every instance of ""lug"" in the input correlates to ""blue"" in the output.
Rule: dax -> green

Every instance where the word ""dax"" appears in the input correlates to the color green in the output. Regardless of its position or the other words around it, ""dax"" consistently results in the color green.
Rule: wif -> red

In each example, the occurrence of ""wif"" translates to ""red"" in the output.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
From the examples given, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green"". Each time ""bluf"" is used, the output is ""green"". Let's confirm this with each instance:

- In the first input, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""yellow"", but this could be a repeated output from ""zup"". We need more information to confirm.
- In the second input, ""bluf"" appears twice and each time the word ""green"" is added to the output. Other nonce words in the sequence (""zup"", ""dax"", ""wif"", ""lug"") are consistently mapped to ""yellow"", ""green"", ""red"", and ""blue"" respectively. Since ""dax"" is also ""green"" and comes before the first ""bluf"", this suggests that the word ""bluf"" represents the color ""green"" and does not depend on the position or surrounding words.
- In the third and fourth inputs, ""bluf"" again corresponds to ""green"" in the output sequence.
- The fifth input isolates ""bluf"" with ""wif"", showing they both correspond to ""red"" in the output. However, since ""red"" appears twice and there are no other words to differentiate the meaning between ""wif"" and ""bluf"", we focus on other examples to deduce that ""wif"" consistently equates to ""red"", thereby suggesting ""bluf"" is most likely ""green"" by elimination and consistency with previous examples.

Even though there is one case where ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"", the majority of evidence from the examples suggests that ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""green"" except when it is preceded by ""wif,"" which seems to modify the next color to ""red"". However, there is not enough information to definitively conclude a modifying rule for ""wif"" without seeing more examples.

Rule: bluf -> green (with a caveat regarding the inconsistency in the last example which might imply an interaction with ""wif"" that we cannot confirm with the given data).
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the word that comes after it to be repeated in the output, with the color associated with that word. The initial insertion of ""walm"" is also associated with the color yellow, just like ""zup"". 

Here's the assessment of the examples:

- In example 1, ""zup walm dax lug"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow green blue"". Here, the ""walm"" before ""dax"" leads to an extra ""yellow"", then ""dax"" leads to ""green"" and finally ""lug"" leads to ""blue"".
  
- In example 2, ""lug walm wif"" leads to ""blue blue blue red"". ""Lug"" leads to ""blue"", the ""walm"" before ""wif"" leads to an extra ""blue"", and ""wif"" leads to ""red"".

- In example 3, ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" leads to ""green red yellow yellow red red red"". ""Dax"" leads to ""green"". ""Wif"" leads to ""red"". ""Zup"" leads to ""yellow"". ""Bluf"" leads to another ""yellow"". The next ""wif"" leads to ""red"", and ""walm"" coming at the end repeats the previous color ""red"".

- In example 4, ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"". ""Zup"" leads to ""yellow"", ""walm"" before ""lug"" leads to two extra ""yellow"", then ""lug"" leads to ""blue"", followed by ""wif"" leading to ""red"", and ""bluf"" to another ""red"".

- In example 5, ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"". ""Zup"" leads to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" does not have a word after it, but it still leads to two more instances of ""yellow"".

Thus, the rule appears to be:
**walm** -> Causes the next word to be repeated in the output (leading to a repeat of the associated color), but is itself associated with yellow when it is the first word or is preceded by another ""walm"". If there's no word after ""walm"", then it just repeats the color associated with itself, which is yellow.

Rule:
- If ""walm"" is followed by another word, that word's color is repeated in the output.
- If ""walm"" is the first word or if it is preceded immediately by another ""walm"", it produces the color yellow in the output.
- If ""walm"" is at the end of the list or not followed by another word, it produces the color yellow for each instance.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
Based on the given examples, it is possible to deduce that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time ""dax"" is used in the input, it is replaced with ""green"" in the output. Here are the rules inferred from the examples:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

The rule is as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"", let's look at the input-output pairs and try to find the pattern.

Looking at the provided examples:

- When the input contains ""wif"" followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""red red"".
- Whenever ""wif"" is followed by ""dax"", the output starts with ""red"" followed by ""green"".
- ""wif"" followed by a pair ""dax lug"" or ""dax zup"" results in ""red"" followed by the colors that ""lug"" (""blue"") and ""zup"" (""yellow"") represent, so ""wif dax lug dax"" gives ""red green blue green"" and ""wif dax zup dax"" gives ""red green yellow green"".

Based on these patterns, it seems that ""wif"" might represent ""red"" as it always precedes ""red"" in the output. However, ""wif"" alone cannot result in the subsequent color since it requires another word to determine the next color in the sequence.

Rule: ""wif"" correlates to the output ""red"" and is followed by the color represented by the word that comes after ""wif"". If ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"", the output sequence repeats ""red""; if it's followed by ""dax"", it's followed by ""green"" and influenced by the word after ""dax"" for the subsequent color.

Hence, the rule could be:

wif -> The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the output and affects the next color based on the following word's associated color.
Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" can be deduced as follows:

Input: zup
Output: yellow

Input: zup
Output: yellow

Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow

Input: lug zup
Output: blue yellow

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

In all instances, regardless of what other words accompany ""zup,"" the output for ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow."" The other words in the examples that precede or follow ""zup"" correspond to their own colors—namely, ""wif"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""red,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" also corresponds to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow. The meaning of ""zup"" is the color yellow.
bluf -> blue

Rule: The word ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the output color sequences and see how they correlate with the input sequences that include the word ""walm.""

1. Example:
Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

In this example, we see ""lug"" follows ""dax"" and the color changes from green to blue. After ""lug"" comes ""walm"" and the color stays blue. ""Zup"" follows ""walm"" and the color stays blue before changing to yellow with ""wif."" From this example, it's not clear what ""walm"" does, but we can note that the color stays consistent through its use.

2. Example:
Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the color remains green, then ""zup"" follows and the color changes to yellow, and then ""walm"" results in the color staying yellow. So, it appears ""walm"" may keep the color consistent, not changing it.

3. Example:
Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

""Zup"" followed by ""walm"" results in the same color, suggesting ""walm"" may reinforce or duplicate the preceding color.

4. Example:
Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Here, ""wif"" results in red, ""walm"" follows and the color remains red, and then ""dax"" changes the color to green followed by ""zup"" which changes it to yellow. This also supports the idea that ""walm"" keeps the color constant.

5. Example:
Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow

""Dax"" results in green, followed by ""wif"" which changes the color to red, then ""walm"" keeps it red. ""Lug"" changes the color to blue and ""zup"" to yellow. Again, the presence of ""walm"" keeps the color unchanged from the previous one.

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color that comes before it. If the input before ""walm"" changes the color, ""walm"" continues that color until a different input word changes it again.

Rule:
walm -> repeats or maintains the previous color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each provided example.
Based on the examples provided, we can determine that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" This can be seen as each occurrence of ""dax"" in the input results in ""green"" in the output. 

The rule is as follows:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" It seems that the other nonce words correspond to different colors: ""lug"" to blue, ""dax"" to green, ""bluf"" to green, and ""zup"" to yellow. There are no variations or additional contexts that alter the meaning of ""wif"" in the given examples. Therefore, the rule for the word ""wif"" concerning the examples provided is as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> meaning

Based on the examples provided:

- ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" maps to ""green blue yellow red red green"". The color sequence mirrors the word sequence with ""bluf"" corresponding to the color ""red"" which is then followed by the word ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"".
- ""lug bluf"" maps to ""blue blue"". Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and is followed by ""bluf"" which also corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""zup bluf"" maps to ""yellow yellow"". Similarly, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is followed by ""bluf"" which also corresponds to ""yellow"".
- ""lug bluf"" (repeated example) confirms that ""bluf"" maps to ""blue"".
- ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" maps to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red"". ""Wif"" typically maps to ""red"", and in this sequence, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and also corresponds to ""red"".

Based on this, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word that immediately precedes it. If ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", it's ""blue""; if it follows ""zup"", it's ""yellow""; and if it follows ""wif"", it's ""red"".  We don't have an example of what color ""bluf"" would correspond to if it comes after ""dax"" or ""walm.""

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color meaning of the immediately preceding word.
From the examples provided, we can infer the following instances of ""walm"":

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug **walm**
   Output: red yellow yellow blue **blue blue**

2. Input: dax wif **walm** lug zup **walm**
   Output: green red **red red** blue yellow yellow yellow

3. Input: dax **walm**
   Output: green **green green**

4. Input: dax **walm** wif **walm** zup
   Output: green **green green** red **red red** yellow

5. Input: lug dax **walm** wif
   Output: blue green **green green** red

To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we must observe what changes in the output when it's included:

- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" or ""dax,"" the color of ""wif"" (red) or ""dax"" (green) repeats in the output.
- When ""walm"" stands alone after ""dax"" as in example 3, it results in the color of ""dax"" (green) being repeated.
- ""Walm"" does not seem to produce a new color itself. It behaves more like a repeater or duplicator of the previous color mentioned.

Therefore, a potential rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color of the previous word. Let's express this as a rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif
    ",Output: green red,green red,True,148
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color in the output. Mapping each word to its respective color:

- ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red""
- ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue""
- ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow""

Given that ""dax"" maps to ""green"" in each example where it appears, we can deduce the meaning for ""dax"" as follows:

dax -> green

Rule: Each nonce word corresponds to a specific color output. The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a color, and the repetition of colors in the output is related to the presence of the word 'wif'. When the word 'wif' is followed by 'bluf', the output consistently includes two instances of the color 'red'. There isn't enough information to ascertain if 'wif' has an effect on preceding or following non-'bluf' words because it only follows another color nonce word once ('zup') and it's not followed by any words in the given examples.

From the examples we can deduce:

- lug walm -> blue blue 
- bluf -> red 
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- wif bluf -> red red

Now, to come up with a rule for 'wif':

- In every instance 'wif' is followed by 'bluf', and the output is 'red red' as opposed to a single 'red' for 'bluf' when it stands alone. 
- 'Wif' does not appear alone or followed by any other word than 'bluf' in the examples. 
- There is no example of 'wif' preceding another color word other than 'bluf', thus we cannot deduce its effect in such a case.

Considering these observations, the simplest rule we can induce from the examples provided is:

Rule: When 'wif' precedes 'bluf', the output is 'red red' rather than just 'red' which would be the output for 'bluf' alone.

So, in terms of a meaning or rule depicted by the word 'wif' as seen in these examples:

wif -> a modifier that when preceding 'bluf' duplicates the color word that follows 'wif', in this case resulting in 'red red' rather than 'red'.
zup -> yellow

Rule: Regardless of the position of ""zup"" within the input sequence or the other words present, it consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. The other words must correspond to different colors; for instance, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" The order of words in the input affects the order of colors in the output.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" triggers the repetition of the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it. 

For instance:
- If ""wif"" (which translates to ""red"") comes before ""bluf"", the output is ""red red"".
- If ""zup"" (which translates to ""yellow"") is before ""bluf"", the output will be ""yellow yellow"".
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax wif"" (which translates to green red), the output after is ""red red"".

So, in short:

bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to correlate with a sequence of the color blue. To synthesize the rule from the given input-output pairs:

- Each instance of 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red'.
- Each instance of 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow'.
- Each instance of 'bluf' corresponds to two instances of the color 'yellow'.
- Each instance of 'lug' corresponds to the color 'blue'.
- Each instance of 'walm' following any word corresponds to repeating the last color mentioned.
- Each instance of 'dax' corresponds to the color 'green'.

Thus, ""walm"" appears to function as an instruction to repeat the last mentioned color in the sequence. If we apply this logic to the inputs and outputs, it matches:

For example: 
- ""lug walm"" would correspond to ""blue blue blue"" because 'lug' is 'blue', followed by two additional blues as per the rule of 'walm'.
- ""zup walm"" would be ""yellow yellow yellow"" because 'zup' is 'yellow', followed by two additional yellows as per the rule of 'walm'.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last color stated in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax
    ",Output: yellow green,yellow green,True,149
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
From the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" Each occurrence of ""lug"" in the input results in ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""lug"" in the sequence or the other words present. The translations of the other nonce words, ""zup,"" ""dax,"" and ""wif,"" appear to correspond to the colors ""yellow,"" ""green,"" and ""red,"" respectively.

Rule:
lug -> blue
Based on the input-output pairs provided, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" appears in the corresponding output. 

Despite a variety of other words appearing in the inputs (such as ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""bluf""), and each of these words being associated with their respective color outputs (""wif"" with ""red,"" ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" potentially indicating a repetition of the color associated with the previous word if we consider the third input), the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""

Thus, the rule can be stated as: 

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" indicates the color ""green"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, wif appears to translate to the color red every time it is used. No matter what other words it is paired with (e.g., bluf, dax, lug), the output consistently includes red whenever wif is present. Other words do not seem to affect this translation.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is mentioned, the word ""yellow"" is produced in the output. Here is how it appears in context:

- ""zup lug"" produces ""yellow blue,"" with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow.""
- In ""zup wif bluf zup,"" the output is ""yellow red red yellow,"" with both instances of ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow.""
- ""dax bluf wif lug zup"" turns into ""green green red blue yellow,"" with ""zup"" at the end corresponding to ""yellow.""
- In ""dax zup wif zup,"" the output ""green yellow red yellow"" shows ""zup"" correlating to ""yellow"" both times it appears.
- Lastly, ""zup dax walm zup wif"" becomes ""yellow green green green yellow red,"" with the first and second-to-last instances of ""zup"" resulting in ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we have to look for patterns in how it corresponds with the given outputs. We'll look for what ""bluf"" is associated with in each example's output:

1. ""dax zup bluf"" corresponds with ""green yellow yellow.""
2. ""zup bluf wif walm"" corresponds with ""yellow yellow red red red.""
3. ""wif bluf dax lug"" corresponds with ""red red green blue.""
4. ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" corresponds with ""red green red red yellow red.""
5. ""zup bluf"" corresponds with ""yellow yellow.""

We can note that ""bluf"" always corresponds to the color ""yellow."" This pattern holds regardless of its position in the input string or the words around it. Thus, we can conclude with a high degree of confidence that ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> yellow.
To induce the rule for ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns and their outputs.

1. zup walm dax zup dax wif -> yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
2. zup dax walm -> yellow green green green
3. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
4. dax walm -> green green green
5. lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow

Looking at these examples, we can identify a pattern for ""walm"". It seems that ""walm"" causes the word that follows it (when there is one) to repeat the color of the word that precedes ""walm"". When ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, it repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

Let's break it down:

1. ""zup walm dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"", ""walm"" caused ""dax"" to repeat the color of ""zup"" once.
2. ""zup dax walm"" -> ""yellow green green green"", ""walm"" at the end makes ""dax""'s color (""green"") repeat three times.
3. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red"", ""walm"" at the end makes ""wif""'s color (""red"") repeat three times.
4. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"", ""walm"" at the end makes ""dax""'s color (""green"") repeat three times.
5. ""lug wif dax walm zup"" -> ""blue red green green green"", ""walm"" caused ""zup"" to repeat the color of ""dax"" (""green"").

The rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that comes before it, once if it’s followed by another word, and three times if it’s at the end of the sequence.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word, once if followed by another word and three times at the end of a sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    ",Output: blue green,blue green,True,150
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the rule for the word ""lug.""

In the first example, ""lug walm zup walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""lug"" precedes ""walm zup walm"" which translates to ""blue blue blue..."" indicating that ""lug"" might carry the meaning ""blue"" since the word ""blue"" is repeated three times as well.

In the second example, ""dax lug dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue green blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" appears to again be associated with the word ""blue"". The repetition of ""blue"" twice after ""lug"" may indicate that ""lug"" carries a repetition factor as well.

In the third example, ""wif dax lug dax"" becomes ""red green blue green,"" here ""lug"" is directly followed by ""blue"" without the repetition seen in the first two examples.

In the fourth example, ""lug dax lug"" translates to ""blue green blue,"" we see that ""lug"" is translated directly to ""blue"" both times it is used.

In the fifth example, ""dax walm zup lug"" becomes ""green green green yellow blue."" Here ""lug"" is at the end and translates to just ""blue.""

Based on these observations, the most consistent meaning for ""lug"" across all examples is that it translates to ""blue."" There doesn't seem to be a consistent repetition rule associated with ""lug,"" as the number of blue outputs vary.

Rule: lug -> blue.
Rule: dax -> green

Each instance of ""dax"" in the examples corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" I'll analyze the patterns in the examples provided:

1. Whenever ""wif"" appears, ""red"" is in the output.
2. The other colors in the output correspond to the words present in the input, but not directly before or after ""wif.""

Now, examining the position of ""wif"" in the inputs and the corresponding outputs:

1. ""zup wif dax"" -> ""yellow red green""  
   ""wif"" appears after ""zup"" and before ""dax,"" the output contains ""red"" between ""yellow"" and ""green.""

2. ""lug dax zup wif"" -> ""blue green yellow red""  
   ""wif"" is at the end, following the sequence ""lug dax zup."" The output ends with ""red.""

3. ""dax zup wif zup"" -> ""green yellow red yellow""  
   ""wif"" is in between two ""zup,"" resulting in ""red"" placed between two ""yellow.""

4. ""wif zup lug wif"" -> ""red yellow blue red""  
   Here, ""wif"" is both at the start and at the end, and ""red"" appears both at the start and end of the output.

5. ""zup lug walm wif walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""  
   ""wif"" comes after ""walm."" Post-""wif,"" every ""walm"" corresponds to an additional ""red.""

From these observations, it appears that ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red."" However, its placement also suggests it might duplicate the color that matches ""walm"" following it. Thus, it seems ""wif"" contributes a ""red"" to the output sequence and duplicates the following color if the next word is ""walm."" Otherwise, it simply contributes ""red"" without duplication.

Rule: wif -> contributes ""red"" to the output sequence and duplicates the following color if the next word is ""walm"".
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in the output irrespective of its position in the input sequence. Here is the evidence from each given example which supports this conclusion:

- In the first example, ""dax zup"" results in ""green yellow,"" with no other indication of what ""dax"" could mean, but ""zup"" aligns with ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""zup bluf lug zup"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue yellow,"" clearly indicating ""bluf"" equals ""blue,"" ""lug"" has been shown in another example to equal ""blue,"" and ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow"" in two positions.
- The third example ""zup"" alone results in ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm zup walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow,"" and considering previous examples, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" thus ""walm"" seems to double the color preceding it; in this case, ""zup"" precedes the doubled yellow.
- Finally, ""wif zup lug"" becoming ""red yellow blue"" with previous knowledge tells us ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and again, ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

Based on these examples, the rule for zup can be defined as:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the position of the word and the corresponding color output in each example.

1. In the first input ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm,"" the output is ""green red yellow yellow red red red."" We note that ""bluf"" corresponds to the first ""yellow"" in the sequence.

2. In the second input ""dax bluf zup,"" the output is ""green green yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""

3. In the third input ""zup wif bluf,"" the output is ""yellow red red."" ""Bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red.""

4. In the fourth input ""wif dax zup bluf,"" the output is ""red green yellow yellow."" ""Bluf"" corresponds to the first ""yellow.""

5. Finally, in the fifth input ""dax wif dax zup bluf,"" the output is ""green red green yellow yellow."" ""Bluf"" corresponds to the first ""yellow.""

From these examples, we see that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color immediately preceding it in the sequence. However, since ""bluf"" is sometimes followed by ""yellow"" and other times by ""red,"" but never by ""green,"" it appears that ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" when it is preceded by ""zup"" (yellow), and to ""green"" when preceded by ""dax"" (green); we don't see a direct previous ""wif"" (red) followed by a ""bluf"" to conclusively deduce what ""bluf"" translates to in this context, but considering the pattern, ""bluf"" could take on the color of the word before it.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> Takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence. If ""dax"" (green) precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" translates to ""green."" If ""zup"" (yellow) precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" is ""yellow."" If ""wif"" (red) precedes ""bluf,"" the assumption is that ""bluf"" would be ""red.""
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns before and after the word in each example and the corresponding outputs. 

Here are the observations:

1. ""dax walm wif walm zup"" produces ""green green green red red red yellow."" Green follows ""dax,"" red follows ""wif,"" and yellow follows ""zup."" The word ""walm"" appears twice and is followed by words that trigger ""green"" and ""red"" respectively.

2. ""lug walm"" yields ""blue blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" without another following word, and ""blue"" is repeated thrice.

3. ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red."" In this case, ""zup"" yields ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" does not seem to correspond to any output (since it is not followed by any color output), ""wif"" yields ""red,"" and ""walm"" results in a repetition of ""red.""

4. ""zup walm lug wif"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow blue red."" We have already established that ""zup"" yields ""yellow,"" and in this context, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue."" ""Walm"" seems to cause a repeat of the color assigned to the word that follows it, in this case, ""blue"" for ""lug."" ""Wif"" at the end yields ""red.""

5. ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red."" The word ""wif"" yields ""red"" on its own, and since ""walm"" follows, it results in a repetition of ""red.""

Based on the observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the repetition of the output color associated with the word that immediately follows it.

Thus, the meaning can be written as:

walm -> a function that repeats the color output of the word that comes after it.

If no word follows ""walm,"" it repeats the color of the previous word an additional two times, for a total of three instances of the color output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be quite straightforward:

Rule: lug -> blue

This indicates that whenever the nonce word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output.
Rule: dax -> green

Looking at the examples:

- lug dax translates to blue green, indicating that dax corresponds to green whenever paired with lug, which translates to blue.
- dax lug dax lug walm shows the pattern green blue green blue, followed by a sequence of blue blue, which suggests that walm translates to blue blue (repeated twice). So, dax alone and when followed by lug translates to green.
- lug dax in the third example reaffirms that this combination translates to blue green with lug translating to blue and dax to green as before.
- dax bluf wif zup lug shows dax at the beginning translating to green, followed by other color translations, including bluf as green, wif as red, zup as yellow, and lug as blue.
- lug zup dax wif translates to blue yellow green red, which is consistent with previous translations, with dax translating to green.

Thus, across all examples, dax consistently translates to green regardless of its position.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's first examine instances where ""zup"" appears and what colors are associated with it in the output.

1. ""zup lug zup wif dax"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow red green"". Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" both times it appears, while other words correspond to their respective colors.

2. ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red"". Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""bluf"" seems to correspond to ""red"" as well.

3. ""zup bluf lug dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue green blue"". ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" once again corresponds to ""yellow"".

4. ""zup dax bluf"" translates to ""yellow green green"". ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""; ""dax"" and ""bluf"" translate to ""green"".

5. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" translates to ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow"". The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", while ""walm"" does not appear in previous examples but also corresponds to ""yellow"" based on this output.

Considering the examples provided, every instance of the word ""zup"" corresponds consistently to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence. ""Bluf"" appears to change its corresponding color based on context, likely dependent on the word preceding it (e.g., ""wif bluf"" or ""dax bluf"" results in red and green respectively), indicating that the rule for ""bluf"" might depend on another factor. However, for ""zup"", there appears to be a direct and consistent translation.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
bluf -> repeats the color of the word that comes before it.

Rule: If a word ""X"" is followed by the word ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" will be the same color as the output for word ""X.""
walm -> repeat the color of the previous word. Rule: When the word ""walm"" is used after another word, it indicates that the color associated with the previous word should be repeated three times.

For example:

In ""dax walm,"" since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" the presence of ""walm"" means ""green"" is repeated three times, resulting in ""green green green.""

In ""wif walm,"" since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" the output after ""walm"" is ""red red red.""

If ""walm"" is followed by another word, such as in ""walm zup,"" it first repeats the color of the word before it, then presents the color for the word after. For example, with ""dax walm zup lug walm,"" it goes ""green (for dax) green green (due to walm) yellow (for zup) blue (for lug) blue blue (due to walm)."" 

The rule remains consistent regardless of which word precedes ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup wif dax
    ",Output: red yellow red green,red yellow red green,True,152
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" correspondents to the color ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears each unique word corresponds to a unique color:

- dax corresponds to green
- lug corresponds to blue
- wif corresponds to red
- zup corresponds to yellow

So the rule would be:

Rule: In this context, dax means green.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that there is a direct mapping from each of these nonce words to color words. From the given inputs and outputs, we can derive the following associations:

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue

Typically, each nonce word is consistently translated to the same color word in the output. Therefore, it seems that the word ""wif"" always corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" seems to signal a change in the color naming pattern. Here's the observed pattern:

- When ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue.""
- When ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- When ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" the output remains ""blue.""
- When ""zup"" appears between repetitions of ""lug"" or ""dax,"" the output is ""yellow"" following the appearance of ""zup.""

The pattern suggests that ""zup"" indicates a switch to ""yellow,"" but when followed by another word (like ""lug"" or ""dax"") without another intervening ""zup,"" it switches back to the respective color assigned to that word. When ""zup"" is at the beginning as in the last example, it starts with ""yellow"" followed by the respective colors without any interruption since ""zup"" does not appear to reset the pattern.

Rule: zup -> switches the output to ""yellow"" when it appears. If followed by another color word (without another ""zup"" intervening), continue with the respective color(s) for the following word(s) until ""zup"" appears again.
bluf -> rule. Rule: The word ""bluf"" duplicates the color word that precedes it. If there is no color word before ""bluf,"" it duplicates the color associated with the word before it. For example, ""lug"" means blue, so ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue."" Similarly, ""wif"" means red, so ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red."" If there are multiple color words before ""bluf,"" it duplicates the color associated with the last color word before it, such as in ""dax zup bluf"" which translates to ""green yellow yellow"" (the color before ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" which means yellow).
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine its use in the different given examples. It appears that ""walm"" corresponds to a color, but the specific color it translates to changes based on context.

Looking at the outputs, each time ""walm"" is used, it translates to a repetition of the color outputted immediately before it.

1. dax lug wif walm -> green blue red red red
   ""walm"" corresponds to ""red,"" which is the color associated with the word that appears right before it, ""wif.""

2. lug walm zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow red
   ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue,"" repeating the color outputted for the word that precedes it, ""lug.""

3. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
   ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" again repeating the color for the preceding word, ""zup.""

4. lug wif zup wif walm -> blue red yellow red red red
   ""walm"" corresponds to ""red,"" repeating the color of the word before it, ""wif.""

5. dax zup walm wif -> green yellow yellow yellow red
   ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" which is the color outputted for the preceding word, ""zup.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:

Walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: ""walm"" translates to the repetition of the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

So, the rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color associated with the preceding word in the list.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf lug walm
    ",Output: yellow yellow blue blue blue,yellow yellow blue blue blue,True,153
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the provided examples.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""dax,"" when it appears, consistently translates to the color ""green."" Without further context, the specific rules relating to the other nonce words (""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""bluf,"" ""zup"") and their corresponding colors can be deduced as follows:

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- walm -> red
- bluf -> green
- zup -> yellow

Using this information to determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we have:

dax -> green

Rule: Each nonce word is associated with a specific color in the output. ""Dax"" is always associated with the color ""green.""
Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following:

- In the first example, ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red"". Since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" (as shown in the second example), and assuming ""walm"" also corresponds to ""red"", ""zup"" is likely translating to ""yellow"".
- In the second example, ""wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow"". This further supports ""zup"" as ""yellow"" since ""wif"" is shown to correspond to ""red"".
- In the third example, ""dax zup lug wif lug"" translates to ""green yellow blue red blue"". ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug wif lug"" translates to ""blue red blue"". This leaves ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"" again.
- In the fourth example, ""zup dax"" translates to ""yellow green"". ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"", hence ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- The fifth example, ""dax zup lug wif zup"" translates to ""green yellow blue red yellow"". ""Dax"" is ""green"", ""lug wif"" corresponds to ""blue red"", and the final ""zup"" once again corresponds to ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow.
bluf -> color

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" changes to a color based on the word preceding it. The preceding word determines which color ""bluf"" represents:

- ""lug"" before ""bluf"" turns ""bluf"" into ""blue.""
- ""zup"" before ""bluf"" turns ""bluf"" into ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" before ""bluf"" turns ""bluf"" into ""green.""

If no word precedes ""bluf,"" additional context would be needed to determine its meaning. In the examples where ""bluf"" is followed by another word (""wif""), this does not seem to affect the meaning of ""bluf"" itself but rather adds another color (""red"") at the end of the output sequence. When ""bluf"" is preceded by two color-indicating words (""dax zup""), it takes the color meaning of the immediate precursor (""zup"" in this case, resulting in ""yellow"").
To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" based on the given examples, let’s first look at the correlation between the inputs and the outputs:

Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow
- Here, ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" output.
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red"" when it appears after ""walm"", but before ""walm"", it doesn't influence the output.
- ""walm"" seems to cause the word after it to repeat its associated color three times.
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"".

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red"" when it doesn't follow ""walm"".
- ""bluf"" correlates with ""green"" when it follows ""dax"", but when it precedes ""dax"" its color is not provided.
- When ""lug"" follows ""walm"", we see ""blue"" output once.

Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"".
- ""walm"" followed by ""zup"" yields three times ""yellow"".
- ""walm"" followed by ""wif"" yields ""red"" three times.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
- ""lug"" again correlates with ""blue"".
- ""walm"" makes ""lug"" repeat the ""blue"" color two more times.

Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
Output: green green green red blue green green green
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green"".
- ""walm"" followed by ""wif"" again yields three ""red"".
- ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in repeating ""green"" twice more.

Based on these observations, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word that directly follows it to be output three times instead of once.

Rule: walm -> Causes the next color to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup dax lug dax
    ",Output: green yellow green blue green,green yellow green blue green,True,154
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" is present in the input, it translates to ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green. 

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the given examples. Every time the word ""dax"" appears, it is translated to ""green"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Here is the breakdown of each given example:

1. ""wif bluf lug zup"" translates to ""red red blue yellow."" Since ""bluf"" has consistently been associated with the color ""blue"" and ""lug"" with ""blue"" as well, we can deduce that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

2. ""wif"" on its own translates to ""red,"" which supports the deduction from example 1.

3. ""lug walm wif bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red red."" Here ""lug"" is again associated with ""blue,"" and the duplication of ""bluf"" results in two instances of ""red,"" which matches the number of times ""wif"" and ""bluf"" appear respectively. Since ""walm"" is not provided in other examples, we assume it translates to ""blue"" to maintain consistency with the output.

4. ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green."" Here ""dax"" is new, but by now we know ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""bluf"" is typically ""red"" (when following ""wif""), thus ""dax"" must mean ""green.""

5. ""wif bluf lug"" translates to ""red red blue."" Again, ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" ""bluf"" is also ""red"" following ""wif,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule is:
wif -> red
Based on the given examples, ""zup"" consistently produces the output ""yellow."" It does not seem to change based on position or surrounding words. Each instance of ""zup"" is unrelated to the context of the other words and independently translates to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the rule for the meaning of ""bluf,"" we will look at the position of ""bluf"" in the input and the corresponding output color. 

From the examples given:

1. Input: zup bluf dax  =>  Output: yellow yellow green
2. Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf  =>  Output: blue red red green blue blue
3. Input: wif lug zup bluf  =>  Output: red blue yellow yellow
4. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax  =>  Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
5. Input: wif lug bluf wif zup  =>  Output: red blue blue red yellow

After observing the patterns, the word preceding ""bluf"" corresponds to the color named in the subsequent output:

- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" we have ""yellow"" following ""bluf"" in the output.
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" we have ""red"" following ""bluf"" in the output.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" we have ""blue"" following ""bluf"" in the output.

It seems that the word ""bluf"" changes its output color accordingly to imitate the color associated with the word preceding it:

- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Therefore, we can induce the rule that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word that precedes it.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to examine the contexts in which it appears and the corresponding outputs. Here are the examples you provided, with the related parts of the outputs in brackets:

1. wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> red red red [green] yellow red blue blue blue
2. wif walm dax zup -> red red red [green] yellow
3. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue [green]
4. wif dax lug walm -> red green blue blue [blue]
5. zup walm dax lug -> yellow yellow yellow [green] blue

By inspecting the patterns associated with the word ""walm"" in the provided input and output sequences, we can observe the following:

- Every time ""walm"" appears in the input, the word immediately after it translates to ""green"" in the output.
- ""Walm"" does not affect the translation of the words that come before it; their corresponding colors do not change whether ""walm"" is present or not.
- The appearance of ""walm"" does not seem to change the output color of any subsequent words either, as seen by comparing the outputs of the first and last examples to the others.

Given these observations, it appears that ""walm"" serves as an indicator for the next word to be translated as ""green,"" but does not contribute a color by itself; it only affects the color translation of the word that follows it.

Rule: walm -> The next word is translated as ""green"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,155
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the output.
Using the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the nonce word dax by looking at the corresponding outputs:

Example 1:
Input: wif zup dax bluf
Output: red yellow green green

Example 2:
Input: lug dax zup
Output: blue green yellow

Example 3:
Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green

Example 4:
Input: dax
Output: green

Example 5:
Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Based on the outputs, whenever the word dax appears in the input, the output is consistently ""green."" There is no other context provided that alters this outcome. Therefore, the rule seems to be straightforward:

Rule: dax -> green. The meaning of dax is green.
The examples provided suggest that ""wif"" correlates with a specific color output whenever it appears within a sequence of inputs. Looking closely at the output of each example when ""wif"" is present, it consistently results in the color ""red."" 

To verify, let's consider the examples:

- ""zup walm wif"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow red.""
- ""wif"" alone leads to ""red.""
- ""dax lug wif"" leads to ""green blue red.""
- ""zup wif dax walm"" leads to ""yellow red green green green.""
- ""dax wif dax"" leads to ""green red green.""

In each case, regardless of what precedes or follows ""wif,"" its presence always corresponds to ""red."" No other word in the examples consistently correlates with the color ""red.""

Therefore, the inferred rule is:

wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, it is possible to deduce that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Here is the derivation:

- Example 1: ""lug zup dax wif zup"" translates to ""blue yellow green red yellow."" The word ""zup"" appears twice and is replaced with ""yellow"" each time.
- Example 2: ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow,"" and since ""lug"" is consistently translated to ""blue"" in other examples, ""zup"" must mean ""yellow.""
- Example 3: ""zup bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow red."" Given that ""bluf"" also translates to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""zup"" is responsible for the first ""yellow"" in the output.
- Example 4: ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" further reinforcing that both ""zup"" and ""bluf"" mean ""yellow.""
- Example 5: ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red,"" and since ""wif"" is known to mean ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To figure out what the word ""bluf"" means, let's analyze the appearance of ""bluf"" and its corresponding color in all given examples.

- Example 1: ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" translates into ""yellow yellow red green red yellow."" The word ""bluf"" corresponds with the second ""yellow.""
- Example 2: ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" translates into ""green blue blue blue green red red green."" Here ""bluf"" corresponds with the first ""red.""
- Example 3: ""wif bluf dax"" translates into ""red red green."" In this example, ""bluf"" corresponds with ""red.""
- Example 4: ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" translates into ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" In this case, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red.""
- Example 5: ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" translates into ""green yellow red red blue."" ""Bluf"" aligns with the second ""red.""

Analyzing these associations, we can notice that ""bluf"" does not always correspond to the same color. However, it seems to always correspond to the repeated color that immediately follows its occurrence. Looking closely, ""bluf"" always precedes the immediately following word except for the last example where ""lug"" follows ""bluf"" and the ""blue"" appears at the end, hence it precedes and doubles the color word that follows it:

- Example 1: ""wif"" follows ""bluf"" and ""red"" is doubled.
- Example 2: ""dax"" follows ""bluf"" and ""red"" is doubled.
- Example 3: ""dax"" follows ""bluf,"" hence ""red"" (even though it is actually ""green"" for ""dax"") suggests that there might be an exception when ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence.
- Example 4: ""dax"" follows ""bluf"" and ""red"" is doubled.
- Example 5: ""lug"" follows ""bluf"" and ""blue"" which corresponds to ""lug"" is doubled at the end.

Considering all these observations, the rule for the word ""bluf"" seems to be that it causes the next color word to be doubled in output. The exception is when ""bluf"" ends the sequence, in which case it may apply to the word that it precedes, if applicable, or the rule doesn't apply since there's no color immediately following to be doubled.

Rule: bluf -> immediately following color is repeated or if it is the final word, the preceding color might be repeated.
From the examples provided, we can deduce the following patterns:

1. 'wif' always translates to 'red'.
2. 'lug' always translates to 'blue'.
3. 'dax' always translates to 'green'.
4. 'zup' always translates to 'yellow'.
5. 'walm' produces a sequence of the color that precedes it in the input.

Analyzing the examples given:

- In the first example, ""wif walm lug bluf"", 'wif' is 'red' and it is followed by 'walm' which leads to a sequence of ""red red red"" before it proceeds with 'lug' and 'bluf', translating to ""blue blue"".
- the second and third examples also show 'walm' producing a sequence of colors matching the preceding word in the input (either 'wif', 'lug', or 'dax').
- The fourth example shows 'lug walm' turning into ""blue blue blue"", again reinforcing that 'walm' repeats the color of the preceding word.
- In the fifth example ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"", after 'zup', 'walm' creates more 'yellow' and then the pattern continues normally with the colors for 'wif' and 'lug'.

Given these observations, the rule for 'walm' is that it repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it in the sequence, and the number of times it repeats that color is the number of characters 'walm' has, which is three.

Rule: walm -> repeats the previous color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,156
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each instance it appears.
From the examples provided, it appears that the words correspond to colors in the following manner:

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow (from the 5th input, where bluf and zup precede a lug, both result in yellow)
- walm -> blue (from the 5th input, it follows a bluf which resulted in yellow, and precedes a dax, which results in blue, and is followed by another lug which also results in blue, walm is thus associated with blue)

We still deduce the meaning of ""dax"" to be ""green"" based on each instance of its occurrence:

1. In the first input, ""dax"" is surrounded by ""wif"" which outputs ""red"", thus ""dax"" in the middle outputs ""green"".
2. In the second input, ""dax"" precedes ""wif"" and the pattern ""green red"" follows, directly attributing ""green"" to ""dax"".
3. In the third input, ""dax"" on its own outputs ""green"".
4. In the fourth input, ""dax"" appears at the end after ""wif"" which is ""red"", and outputs ""green"".
5. In the fifth input, ""dax"" appears towards the end after a sequence including ""walm"" (blue) and ""lug"" (blue), and ""dax"" itself outputs ""green"", which follows the established rule.

Rule: dax -> green.
Observing the input/output pairs:

- When ""wif"" is directly followed by ""dax"", the corresponding output is ""red green"".
- When ""wif"" precedes ""lug"", the output is ""red blue"".
- ""wif"" by itself results in ""red"".
- ""zup wif"" results in ""yellow red"". Hence, ""wif"" is ""red"" while it seems ""zup"" is ""yellow"".
- When ""wif"" occurs after ""zup"" and before ""dax"" the output includes ""yellow red green"", showing consistency of ""wif"" being ""red"" and again ""dax"" being associated with ""green"".

Based on the above, it is consistent to deduce that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" regardless of its position or what follows it. The context or position of ""wif"" does not appear to change its meaning.

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Whenever the input contains the word ""zup,"" it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" is translated to the color ""red"" in the output. In every example where ""bluf"" appears, it consistently corresponds to ""red"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze each pair of input and output:

- ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" -> ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue""
- ""zup dax lug walm zup"" -> ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow""
- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
- ""lug wif dax walm zup"" -> ""blue red green green green yellow""
- ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" -> ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue""

In examining the outputs, it is apparent that ""walm"" produces a sequence of the same color. The color it produces matches the color produced by the word immediately preceding it. For every instance of ""walm"" in the input, the output repeats the color that the previous word represents, as follows:

- lug -> blue, walm -> blue blue (repeats the color of lug)
- zup -> yellow, walm -> blue blue blue (repeats the color of lug, which is the last non-walm)
- lug -> blue, walm -> blue blue blue (repeats the color of lug)
- dax -> green, walm -> green green (repeats the color of dax)
- wif -> red, walm -> red red (repeats the color of wif), lug -> blue, walm -> blue blue blue (repeats the color of lug)

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color indicated by the word immediately before ""walm"" for a sequence of three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: In each example, whenever the word ""lug"" appears, it is translated as ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the input string.
To deduce the meaning or rule for ""dax,"" we need to analyze where it appears in the inputs and what color it corresponds to in the outputs.

For every instance:

1. ""dax walm zup lug dax"" -> green green green yellow blue green
   - ""dax"" appears at the beginning and end. Both times it maps to ""green.""

2. ""dax zup lug wif zup"" -> green yellow blue red yellow
   - ""dax"" appears at the beginning and maps to ""green.""

3. ""dax bluf wif lug"" -> green green red blue
   - ""dax"" appears at the beginning and maps to ""green.""

4. ""lug dax bluf wif dax"" -> blue green green red green
   - ""dax"" appears in the middle and at the end and maps to ""green"" both times.

5. ""zup dax"" -> yellow green
   - ""dax"" appears at the end and maps to ""green.""

In each case, ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" seems to be the following:

Whenever ""wif"" is encountered in the input, the output is ""red.""

Thus, we can express the rule as:
wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears, translate it to ""red.""
Based on the examples given, we can induce the following rule regarding the nonce word ""zup"":

Whenever the word ""zup"" is used, it is associated with the color ""yellow"" in the output.

Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
Output: red green yellow red green green
Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" between ""green"" and ""red"".

Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow
Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" following ""green"" and preceding ""blue"", and again ""yellow"" at the end.

Input: zup dax
Output: yellow green
Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when it comes before ""dax"" which is ""green"".

Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow
Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" at the end of the sequence.

Input: zup
Output: yellow
Here, ""zup"" on its own corresponds to ""yellow"".

Therefore, we can conclude that the rule for ""zup"" is that it translates directly to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the context within the sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> blue
Observing the inputs and outputs carefully, you can notice a pattern related to the word ""walm"" and its corresponding output color(s).

In each example, whenever the nonce word ""walm"" appears, it is followed by a series of ""blue"" in the output, and the number of ""blue"" corresponds to the number of words following ""walm"" in the input, plus one. There are no instances of ""walm"" being the last word in the input to contradict this observation.

Let's verify the rule with the examples:

1. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   Pattern: ""walm"" is followed by two words (""zup""), which results in two ""blue"" plus one additional ""blue"" for ""walm"" itself.

2. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   Pattern: ""walm"" is followed by no words, which results in zero ""blue"" plus one additional ""blue"" for ""walm"" itself.

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Pattern: ""walm"" is followed by no words, hence again we have zero ""blue"" plus one additional ""blue"" for ""walm"" itself.

4. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
   Pattern: The first ""walm"" is followed by three words (""zup lug wif""), which results in three ""blue"" plus one additional ""blue"". The second ""walm"" is followed by one word (""zup""), which results in one ""blue"" plus one additional ""blue"" for ""walm"" itself.

5. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   Pattern: ""walm"" is followed by two words (""lug wif""), which results in two ""blue"" plus one additional ""blue"" for ""walm"" itself.

Considering these observations, we can deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

walm -> meaning. Meaning: ""walm"" is translated as ""blue"", and it causes every word after it, up to the next color word, to be translated as ""blue"" as well.

Rule: ""walm"" translates to an output of ""blue"", followed by further outputs of ""blue"" for the number of words following ""walm"" until another color word is encountered or the input sequence ends.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word 'lug' appears in the input, the word 'blue' appears in the corresponding position in the output.
To determine the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""dax,"" let's examine the output patterns every time ""dax"" is used in the input examples:

1. dax walm wif -> green green green red
2. wif dax zup walm -> red green yellow yellow yellow
3. wif lug dax lug -> red blue green blue
4. wif bluf dax -> red red green
5. wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

It appears that whenever ""dax"" is used in the input, the corresponding output is ""green."" None of the other words in the input (wif, walm, zup, lug, bluf) consistently translate to ""green"" in the output, and each of them can correspond to a different color. Therefore, we can deduce that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

dax -> meaning: green. Rule: Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""green.""
wif -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, the meaning of ""wif"" appears consistent throughout all instances. The rule for the nonce word ""wif"" in this context is that it translates to the word ""red."" 

Rule: wif = red
zup -> yellow

Rule: Every time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it is translated to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Rule: bluf -> repetition of the color associated with the previous word. 

The word ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word that comes directly before it. When ""zup"" is before ""bluf"", the output is ""yellow yellow"" because the color for ""zup"" is yellow. Similarly, ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""lug"" to blue, and ""dax"" to green. Thus, when ""bluf"" follows any of these words, the output repeats the color associated with that word. 

For example: 

- ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"", so ""bluf"" repeats the color yellow which is associated with ""zup"".
- ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"", thereby ""bluf"" repeats the color blue which is associated with ""lug"".
- ""wif bluf dax lug"" translates to ""red red green blue"", and in this case ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" repeating the color red.
- ""wif dax bluf"" translates to ""red green green"", where ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and repeats the color green.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to take on the property of repeating the color word that preceded it in the input series. It translates the previous word into a color and repeats that color as many times as the preceding color word is repeated in the input (if any).

Here are the observed relationships:

- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"", indicating ""zup"" means ""yellow"" and ""walm"" triggers a repetition of ""yellow"" three times.
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"", suggesting ""lug"" means ""blue"" and ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times.
- ""lug zup walm lug"" includes both ""lug"" (blue) and ""zup"" (yellow) before ""walm"". ""Walm"" repeats the immediate preceding color (""zup"" which is yellow) three times before the sequence ends with ""lug"" (blue).
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" demonstrates ""wif"" is ""red"", ""bluf"" might mean nothing or a single occurrence (since it doesn't affect the output), ""lug"" is ""blue"" as before, ""dax"" is ""green"", and ""walm"" causes the previous color ""blue"" to be repeated twice before the sequence continues.
- ""dax wif walm lug zup"" presents ""dax"" (green), ""wif"" (red), and then ""walm"", which causes ""red"" to be repeated two more times before ""lug"" (blue) and ""zup"" (yellow) appear.

So, it can be concluded that ""walm"" repeats the color that was most recently mentioned a number of times equal to the number of times that word appears in the input before ""walm"".

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the color word preceding ""walm"" for as many times as the preceding color word occurs in the input sequence before ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax
    ",Output: blue green,blue green,True,159
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples given, it appears that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule seems to be quite straightforward in this context.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input or the context of the words around it. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the presence of ""dax"" in the input and the word ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" Here's the observed correspondence from the examples:

- ""lug wif dax zup walm"" -> ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow""
- ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue""
- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""

In each instance, ""wif"" is directly translated to ""red,"" regardless of its position or the other words present.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""zup"" appears to correspond to the color ""yellow."" Each instance of ""zup"" in the inputs is translated to ""yellow"" in the outputs.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the given examples, ""bluf"" seems to be associated with the word ""green."" However, it's not that simple since the output color depends on the position and/or combination with other words. Let's analyze the examples provided to find out the underlying rule:

1. ""dax bluf"" leads to ""green green,"" so ""bluf"" could mean ""green,"" but only if ""dax"" also means ""green.""

2. ""dax bluf zup"" leads to ""green green yellow."" Here, ""zup"" appears to mean ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" still leads to ""green"" when adjacent to ""dax.""

3. ""zup wif bluf"" leads to ""yellow red red."" Now ""bluf"" results in ""red"" when it follows ""wif,"" and ""zup"" still produces ""yellow.""

4. ""wif zup dax bluf"" leads to ""red yellow green green."" Thus, ""bluf"" leads to ""green"" when it comes after ""dax,"" and other words have consistent meanings.

5. ""wif bluf lug zup"" leads to ""red red blue yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" seems to stand for ""red"" when it follows ""wif,"" and ""lug"" seems to mean ""blue.""

From these observations, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" means ""green"" when it follows ""dax"" and ""red"" when it follows ""wif."" There's not enough data to say what ""bluf"" means in other contexts.

Rule: ""bluf"" means ""green"" after ""dax"" and ""red"" after ""wif."" For other contexts, more data is needed.
Based on the given examples, ""walm"" appears to be related to the color associated with the preceding word, and it repeats that color an equivalent number of times the ""walm"" phrase appears. Let's break down the examples:

1. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red"":
   ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow"" and ""wif"" by ""red"", but ""walm"" yields ""red red red"".

2. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"":
   ""dax"" is followed by ""green"", and ""walm"" yields ""green green green"".

3. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"":
   ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow"", and ""walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow"".

4. ""wif walm dax"" -> ""red red red green"":
   ""wif"" is followed by ""red"", ""walm"" yields ""red red red"", and ""dax"" is followed by ""green"".

5. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"":
   ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow"", ""walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow"", ""lug"" is followed by ""blue"", ""wif"" by ""red"", and ""bluf"" is not defined in the given examples.

From these examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows another word, it replaces that word's corresponding color and repeats that color an equivalent number of times ""walm"" appears.

Therefore, the definition of ""walm"" seems to be:
walm -> A repeat function to multiply the output of the previous color word by the number of times ""walm"" appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif
    ",Output: blue red,blue red,True,160
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples, regardless of the context or position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rules for the nonce word ""dax"" and the other words in context:

- ""dax"" on its own corresponds to the color ""green.""
- Each unique word following ""dax"" corresponds to a different color.
- The word ""walm"" whenever it occurs following ""dax"" is translated as repeating the color ""green"" thrice.

Now, let's analyze the inputs against the outputs to identify each word's associated color:

1. Input: dax
   Output: green
   Rule: ""dax"" -> ""green""

2. Input: dax zup lug wif zup
   Output: green yellow blue red yellow
   Rule: ""zup"" occurs twice and each time it corresponds to ""yellow"". ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". 

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Rule: ""walm"" corresponds to three repetitions of the color ""green"".

4. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
   Rule: Again, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" The ""walm"" again triggers three repetitions of the color ""green"", but this time since ""red"" came just before it, ""walm"" might translate to three repetitions of the immediately preceding color. 

5. Input: dax lug
   Output: green blue
   Rule: Consistent with the second example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

Based on these observations, the working rule induction for ""dax"" and subsequent words is:

""dax"" -> ""green""
""lug"" -> ""blue""
""wif"" -> ""red""
""zup"" -> ""yellow""
""walm"" -> repeat the color that comes before it three times

If ""walm"" follows ""dax"" immediately, the color repeated is ""green""; if it follows another color, it repeats that color thrice.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word 'wif', we need to look at the patterns in which it appears and the outputs associated with those patterns.

Analyzing the given examples:

1) dax wif dax -> green red green
This shows that 'wif' is between two 'dax', which both translate to 'green', and 'wif' corresponds to 'red' here.

2) wif dax wif lug wif -> red green red blue red
Here 'wif' appears three times. The first 'wif' is followed by 'dax' (green), the second 'wif' is followed by 'lug' (blue), and the third 'wif' stands alone at the end. 'wif' consistently corresponds to 'red'.

3) zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
'wif' follows 'zup' (yellow) and precedes 'walm' which also translates to 'red', followed by 'lug' (blue).

4) wif zup dax -> red yellow green
'wif' comes before 'zup' (yellow) and 'dax' (green).

5) lug wif zup wif -> blue red yellow red
'wif' is between 'lug' (blue) and 'zup' (yellow), and it still translates to 'red'.

From these examples, we can deduce that 'wif' is not affected by the words around it, as it consistently translates to 'red' regardless of context.

Rule: wif -> red.
From the given examples, we can infer the following:

Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
- It seems that ""wif"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""red"" and ""yellow"" respectively. After ""zup"" we see ""yellow blue"" followed by ""yellow"" again.

Input: zup
Output: yellow
- ""zup"" by itself translates to ""yellow.""

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
- Here ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" might correspond to another ""yellow"" as well.

Input: wif dax zup wif
Output: red green yellow red
- The occurrence of ""zup"" is between ""green"" and ""red,"" and it corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: dax walm zup lug dax
Output: green green green yellow blue green
- Here ""zup"" precedes ""yellow blue"" which is again followed by the color that matches the word preceding ""zup,"" which is ""green"" for ""dax.""

Based on the examples, the word ""zup"" always corresponds to the output ""yellow."" However, after ""zup,"" there is always a ""blue"" followed by the color corresponding to the word after ""zup."" In the case of ""dax walm zup lug dax,"" ""lug"" is not directly followed by a color output, suggesting that ""lug"" might be associated with ""blue"" when following ""zup.""

Rule: zup -> yellow, followed by a pattern where the next color output is ""blue"" and then the color corresponding to the next word in the input sequence. If ""zup"" is at the end of a sequence or not followed by a word with a corresponding color, only ""yellow"" is outputted for ""zup.""
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

- Whenever the word ""bluf"" appears, the color ""red"" is in the output.
- The position of ""bluf"" in the input doesn't affect its output color.
- All other words in the input correspond to a different output color which is consistent across examples (e.g., ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"").

Given these observations, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: bluf -> red
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three additional times. Specifically, ""walm"" takes the last color mentioned and repeats it three times. 

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

Here are the examples elaborated with the proposed rule application:

1. lug zup walm lug
   - lug corresponds to blue, zup to yellow
   - Since zup precedes walm, walm results in three more yellows
   - The final lug returns to blue
   - Blue yellow yellow yellow blue

2. zup walm wif
   - zup corresponds to yellow
   - walm repeats the previous color (yellow) three times
   - wif corresponds to red
   - Yellow yellow yellow red

3. dax zup walm wif walm
   - dax corresponds to green, zup to yellow
   - walm repeats yellow three times
   - wif corresponds to red
   - Another walm repeats red three times
   - Green yellow yellow yellow red red red

4. dax lug dax lug walm
   - dax corresponds to green, lug to blue
   - walm repeats the last color mentioned (blue) three times
   - Green blue green blue blue blue

5. dax lug walm
   - dax corresponds to green, lug to blue
   - walm repeats blue three times
   - Green blue blue blue

Therefore, the rule for walm is: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax walm wif
    ",Output: yellow green green green red,yellow green green green red,True,161
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""lug"" seems to be consistent across all instances. It always corresponds to the color blue in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. 

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

Explanation: In each example, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.
Based on the examples given, the word 'wif' seems to be consistently translated to the color 'red'.

Rule: wif -> red.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" we should look at the position of ""zup"" in the input sequences and the corresponding colors in the output sequences.

In the inputs and outputs provided:

1. ""zup wif walm lug"" results in ""yellow red red red blue.""
2. ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow.""
3. ""zup wif"" results in ""yellow red.""
4. ""zup dax wif"" results in ""yellow green red.""
5. ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" results in ""green green red yellow blue.""

In every output sequence, ""yellow"" appears in the position following wherever ""zup"" is located in the input sequence. This indicates that ""zup"" is directly translated to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" correlates with the word ""blue"" each time it is used. Here's the deduction for each input-output pair:

Input: lug zup bluf dax
Output: blue yellow yellow green
- ""bluf"" corresponds with the second ""yellow"" which is out of pattern, suggesting ""blue.""

Input: dax lug bluf wif
Output: green blue blue red
- ""bluf"" corresponds with the second ""blue.""

Input: dax zup lug bluf
Output: green yellow blue blue
- ""bluf"" corresponds with the second ""blue.""

Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
Output: yellow yellow red blue green
- ""bluf"" corresponds with the first ""yellow,"" implying the pattern should continue, but it breaks and ""blue"" is used instead.

Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
Output: yellow green yellow green red red
- ""bluf"" corresponds with the second ""red,"" indicating it should be ""blue"" to follow the previous color patterns.

The examples indicate that ""bluf"" consistently means ""blue,"" even when its placement in a sequence would suggest a different color based on the surrounding patterns. Therefore, ""bluf"" is not dependent on context but is a one-to-one replacement for ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> blue.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the color that comes immediately before it three times. Here is the breakdown according to each example:

1. lug walm zup walm
   - Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"" (lug corresponds to blue, and walm repeats it two more times).
   - ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"" (zup corresponds to yellow, and walm repeats it two more times).

2. zup lug walm
   - Output: yellow blue blue blue
   - ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"" (lug corresponds to blue, and walm repeats it two more times).
   - Note zup corresponds to yellow and is not immediately followed by walm, thus it does not get repeated.

3. dax lug wif walm
   - Output: green blue red red red
   - ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"" (wif corresponds to red, and walm repeats it two more times).

4. wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   - Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
   - ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"" (repeating red two more times).
   - ""wif walm"" again translates to ""red red red"" (repeating red two more times).

5. dax zup walm wif
   - Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   - ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"" (zup corresponds to yellow, and walm repeats it two more times).

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: walm -> causes the color word that precedes it to be repeated two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug walm dax walm
    ",Output: green blue blue blue green green green,green blue blue blue green green green,True,162
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the examples provided, every instance of the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds directly to the color ""blue"" in the output. Hence, the meaning of ""lug"" in these examples is consistently the color blue.
Based on the given examples, each input word is converted to a specific output color. To isolate the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we can look at the output sequence where ""dax"" appears and the color that corresponds to its position. 

In every example given:

- ""wif dax wif"" corresponds to ""red green red""
- ""lug dax lug"" corresponds to ""blue green blue""
- ""zup lug dax"" corresponds to ""yellow blue green""
- ""lug dax bluf"" corresponds to ""blue green green""
- ""zup dax bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow green green""

The word ""dax"" consistently results in the color ""green"" in the output. Using this information, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples given, each nonce word seems to correspond to a specific color.

Here is the correlation I can see:

- The word ""wif"" always corresponds to the color red.
- The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red when following ""wif"" but appears as blue otherwise. 
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.


Therefore, according to the given examples, the meaning of wif is a consistent representation of the color red, regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> meaning. Meaning is ""yellow."" Rule: Every time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow.""
bluf -> the color associated with the word preceding it. 

Rule: If a word is immediately followed by ""bluf,"" then the output is the color that corresponds to that word, repeated twice. For example, ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. If ""bluf"" is followed by the same word that corresponds to a color, the word ""bluf"" behaves as an echo of that color, resulting in the color being output twice in a row.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns of the examples provided:

- When ""dax walm lug"" is the input, the output is ""green green green blue.""
  - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
  - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
  - ""walm"" must correspond to ""green"" (repeated for emphasis).

- When ""wif walm dax"" is the input, the output is ""red red red green.""
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
  - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
  - ""walm"" must correspond to ""red"" (repeated for emphasis).

- When ""wif lug walm"" is the input, the output is ""red blue blue blue.""
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
  - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
  - ""walm"" must correspond to ""blue"" (repeated for emphasis).

- When ""wif walm"" is the input, the output is ""red red red.""
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
  - ""walm"" must correspond to ""red"" (repeated for emphasis).

- When ""dax walm zup walm"" is the input, the output is ""green green green yellow yellow yellow.""
  - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
  - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
  - ""walm"" must correspond to ""green"" and ""yellow"" (repeated for emphasis both times).

Looking at the patterns, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it. This is backed by how it repeats ""red"" when it is immediately after ""wif,"" ""green"" when after ""dax,"" and ""blue"" when after ""lug."" However, for the input ""wif walm,"" we have only ""red red red,"" even though no other word follows ""walm."" This may suggest that when ""walm"" appears at the end or alone after a word, it also repeats the color of the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the word immediately before it. If it is at the end or appears without a word following it, it still repeats the color of the word that came before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,163
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"". Every output that corresponds to an input including the word ""lug"" always contains the word ""blue"". However, we must note other patterns to see if there are any additional rules:

1. When ""lug"" is used by itself (Input: lug), the output is singular ""blue"".
2. When ""lug"" is used in conjunction with ""dax"" (Input: dax lug, dax lug walm), ""dax"" precedes ""blue"" with ""green"".
3. When ""lug"" is used with ""zup"" (Input: lug zup), ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"". 

From these observations, we can deduce the meaning of ""lug"" and write the rule:

Rule: lug -> blue.

""Lug"" translates to the word ""blue"", and can be modified by other words to yield a sequence of colors.

Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following mappings:

- ""dax"" always maps to the output ""green.""
- ""wif"" always maps to the output ""red.""
- ""zup"" always maps to the output ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" always maps to the output ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" always maps to the output ""blue.""
- ""walm"" always seems to duplicate the subsequent color, as it turns ""lug"" into ""blue blue.""

Rule: ""dax"" seems to consistently correspond to the color ""green,"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence.

dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" seems to trigger the output of ""red."" However, it is also important to look at the context to determine whether ""wif"" has a consistent meaning regardless of its position in the input sequence or is influenced by the words around it.

From the examples:

1. When ""dax"" is present, the output is ""green.""
2. When ""lug"" is present, the output is ""blue.""
3. When ""walm"" is present, the output is ""green.""
4. When ""zup"" is present, the output is ""yellow.""

Consistently, after the word ""wif,"" the output is ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input or the words around it.

Therefore, based on the examples provided, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: Wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" Every time ""zup"" is used in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. Here are the translations one by one:

1. lug zup -> blue yellow
2. zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue
3. dax zup -> green yellow
4. dax lug zup -> green blue yellow
5. zup lug wif dax lug -> yellow blue red green blue

Additionally, other words seem to translate consistently to other colors as well:
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""walm"" translates to ""blue blue"" (or ""blue"" repeated)
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the examples, each nonce word seems to correspond to a color. To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can look at the word's position in the input and the corresponding color it translates to in the output:

1. Input: dax lug wif **bluf**
   Output: green blue red **red**

2. Input: dax lug zup wif **bluf** dax
   Output: green blue yellow red **red** green

3. Input: wif walm lug **bluf**
   Output: red red red **blue** **blue**

4. Input: lug **bluf** wif
   Output: blue **blue** red

5. Input: lug wif **bluf**
   Output: blue red **red**

Let's analyze the positions where ""bluf"" leads to the output ""red"":

- In Example 1, ""bluf"" is the fourth word and it corresponds to ""red.""
- In Example 2, ""bluf"" is the fifth word (before the last) and it also results in ""red.""

However, in Example 3, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue,"" not ""red."" In this case, ""bluf"" is followed by no other words and is preceded by a repetition (""lug bluf"" following ""wif walm""). Rule-wise, this suggests ""bluf"" might output ""red"" except in certain contexts where it might result in ""blue.""

Furthermore, in Example 4 and Example 5, it's seen that when ""bluf"" immediately follows ""lug,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""blue,"" not ""red.""

Combining the observed patterns, it is possible to induce that the rule for ""bluf"" is likely context-dependent, with ""bluf"" corresponding to ""red"" unless it directly follows ""lug"" or is the final word in a repeated sequence, in which case it could be ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> ""red"" by default. If it follows ""lug"" or is the last word in a repeated pattern, it becomes ""blue.""
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can look at the pattern of the inputs and their respective outputs to determine the relationship between the two.

From the examples given:
- ""wif lug dax walm"" outputs ""red blue green green green,"" so when we add ""walm"" to ""dax,"" we get repeated ""green.""
- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow,"" so when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" it's producing repeated ""yellow.""
- ""dax walm wif walm zup"" outputs ""green green green red red red yellow,"" so ""walm"" after ""dax"" is repeating ""green,"" but after ""wif,"" it is repeating ""red,"" and then ""zup"" follows, breaking the repetition with a single ""yellow.""
- ""dax lug walm"" outputs ""green blue blue blue,"" so when ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it gives repeated ""blue.""
- ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" outputs ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow,"" in which ""walm"" follows ""zup"" for a repetition of ""yellow.""

The pattern indicates that ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it to repeat. If no word precedes ""walm,"" the default appears to be ""yellow,"" as seen in the example ""zup walm"" - there is nothing before ""zup,"" and yet the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" can be defined as:
walm -> causes repetition of the color associated with the previous word. If no word precedes it, the repeated color is yellow.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: lug translates to the color blue in all provided examples.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""dax"" seems to elicit the response ""green."" Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output includes ""green.""

Here's the analysis per example:

Example 1: 
- dax walm wif lug dax walm
- green green green red blue green green green
- The appearance of ""dax"" coincides with ""green.""

Example 2: 
- zup bluf wif dax wif zup
- yellow yellow red green red yellow
- Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Example 3: 
- wif lug dax
- red blue green
- The single ""dax"" corresponds to the single ""green.""

Example 4: 
- zup dax walm zup wif
- yellow green green green yellow red
- ""dax"" appears once and corresponds to a ""green.""

Example 5: 
- dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
- green blue blue blue green red red green
- Each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Rule:
dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word 'wif' consistently corresponds to the color 'red'. Regardless of whether other words are present, whenever 'wif' is mentioned, the color 'red' is output. Other words in the examples correlate with other specific colors; 'lug' correlates with 'blue', and 'dax' correlates with 'green'. The word 'bluf' does not seem to have a one-to-one correspondence, though, since it appears to output 'red' when paired with 'wif', yet no output is provided for 'bluf' alone to confirm its meaning.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow."" There does not appear to be any contextual dependence or variation in the translation of ""zup"" to its output, as ""zup"" always results in ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input or the other words surrounding it.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the rule underlying the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the outputs whenever the input contains ""bluf.""

1. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

2. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow

3. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
   Output: red yellow yellow red green

4. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

5. Input: dax bluf zup
   Output: green green yellow

When ""bluf"" appears, here are the patterns that we observe:

1. In the first example, the word following ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" whose color is red. There are two reds at the end of the output.
2. In the second example, there is no word after ""bluf."" Therefore, only one yellow is listed after the two initial colors corresponding to ""dax"" and ""zup.""
3. In the third example, after ""bluf"" comes ""wif,"" and there are two reds, not immediately following but mirrored at each end of the sequence.
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is immediately followed by the end of the sequence, and we see two reds again.
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is immediately followed by ""zup,"" and we see two greens before the final yellow corresponding to ""zup.""

Based on these observations, the general rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

bluf-> meaning: The color corresponding to the word immediately following ""bluf"" is repeated twice.

Rule: If a word follows ""bluf,"" repeat the color corresponding to that word twice in the sequence. If ""bluf"" is the last word, repeat the color corresponding to the word preceding ""bluf"" twice.
Based on the given examples, each time the word ""walm"" appears, it causes the output to have three of the same color consecutively. Additionally, this color appears to correspond to the color that immediately precedes ""walm."" Here is how the rule applies to each input:

1. ""lug walm wif lug"" -> ""blue blue blue red blue""
   The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" When ""walm"" follows ""lug"", the output is three consecutive ""blue.""
   
2. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
   The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the output is three consecutive ""green.""

3. ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red""
   The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" When ""walm"" follows ""zup"", the output is three consecutive ""yellow.""

4. ""lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue""
   The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" When ""walm"" follows ""zup"", the output is three consecutive ""yellow.""

5. ""zup dax walm zup wif"" -> ""yellow green green green yellow red""
   The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the output is three consecutive ""green.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color of the word just before it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ","Output: red
",red,True,165
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, it translates to ""blue"" in the output. Therefore, lug -> blue.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the sequence. Here are the consistent observations supporting this conclusion:

- When ""dax"" appears after ""zup,"" the output sequence ends with green.
- When ""dax"" is the only word in the input, the output is green.
- ""Dax"" appears at the start, middle, and end of input sequences, and in each case, the corresponding output contains green in the position matching ""dax.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
Analyzing the inputs and corresponding outputs:

- When 'wif' is followed by 'zup' or 'bluf', the output is 'red yellow'.
- When 'wif' is followed by 'dax', the output is 'red green'.
- When 'wif' appears alone or is preceded by 'lug', the output is 'red'.

The outputs are always starting with 'red' when 'wif' is present. The color following 'red' depends on the word that follows 'wif':

- 'zup' and 'bluf' both result in 'yellow'.
- 'dax' results in 'green'.

When no word follows 'wif', as in 'wif lug' and 'lug wif lug', the output is 'red' followed by the color associated with the word that follows or precedes 'wif'. 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'.

Rule: wif -> red. 'wif' translates to the color 'red', and when followed by another word, it takes the color corresponding to that word.
Based on the examples provided, we can observe the following correlations:

- Whenever ""zup"" appears, the corresponding output color is ""yellow"".
- The word ""zup"" does not seem to alter its meaning based on position in the input sequence.
- Other words like ""dax"", ""wif"", and ""lug"" consistently map to colors ""green"", ""red"", and ""blue"" respectively, regardless of their position in relation to ""zup"".

Given these observations, the rule seems to be clear:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" is used to repeat the color word that directly precedes it. Here is the rule derived from the examples:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color word that immediately precedes ""bluf.""

For instance:
- In ""lug bluf zup,"" ""lug"" is blue, so ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue,"" repeated.
- In ""dax bluf wif zup,"" ""dax"" is green, so ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" repeated.

Therefore: bluf -> Repeat the preceding color word.
Based on the examples provided, we can see a repetition of colors corresponding to the words preceding and following the nonce word 'walm.'

Let's analyze each example and identify patterns:

1. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
2. dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
3. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red
4. wif walm zup walm -> red red red yellow yellow yellow
5. dax walm wif walm zup -> green green green red red red yellow

From these examples, we can see that the output color that corresponds to 'walm' repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it:

- In Example 1, 'zup' proceeds 'walm' and the output is 'yellow yellow yellow'.
- In Example 2, 'wif' proceeds 'walm' and the output corresponding to 'walm' is 'red red red'; 'zup' proceeds the second 'walm', hence the output 'yellow yellow yellow'.
- In Example 3, 'zup' proceeds 'walm' with the output 'yellow yellow yellow' and follows 'wif' with the output 'red'.
- In Example 4, 'wif' proceeds both instances of 'walm' and the corresponding outputs are 'red red red' and 'yellow yellow yellow' from 'zup'.
- In Example 5, 'dax' proceeds the first 'walm' and 'wif' proceeds the second. The outputs are 'green green green' and 'red red red' respectively. 'Zup' which comes after the second 'walm' is not repeated since it does not precede a 'walm'.

From this, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.


    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ","Output: blue
",blue,True,166
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Analyzing the provided examples, let's try to identify patterns associated with the word ""lug"" and its respective output color.

Example 1:
Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

In this sequence, ""lug"" is followed by ""zup"" and the corresponding colors are ""yellow blue.""

Example 2:
Input: wif dax lug walm
Output: red green blue blue blue

Here, ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" and the colors are ""blue blue blue.""

Example 3:
Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
Output: blue green yellow green green green red

In this case, ""lug"" is the first word, and it's followed by ""dax,"" with colors ""blue green.""

Example 4:
Input: zup dax lug walm zup
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

Here again, ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" and the colors are ""blue blue blue.""

Example 5:
Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Once more, ""lug"" is followed by ""dax,"" and the colors are ""blue green.""

From these observations, we can notice that:

- When ""lug"" is followed by ""dax,"" the color blue is always the first color in the output.
- When ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" we see a sequence of blue colors (three times blue in the given examples).
- ""Lug"" itself is represented by the color blue in every example.

Based on these patterns, it seems that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Whether ""lug"" results in multiple instances of blue or just a single blue may depend on what word follows ""lug,"" but since the word ""lug"" consistently translates to at least the first blue in the sequence, the simplest interpretation is that ""lug"" means blue.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the input and output pairs given, it seems that each unique word has a corresponding color associated with it. The same input consistently results in the same color output, indicating that the relationship between the input word and the output color is fixed.

The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue,"" and ""zup"" consistently results in the output ""yellow."" The word ""dax"" appears in each input and is always followed by the output ""green."" It does not seem to matter where ""dax"" appears in the sequence; its presence always results in the color ""green.""

Given this pattern, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" can be established as follows:

dax -> meaning: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

Rule: When the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output will have the color ""green"" corresponding to it.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we'll first examine each provided example and output sequence to see if there are any patterns.

Example 1: 
Input: wif
Output: red

Example 2: 
Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red

Example 3:
Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

Example 4:
Input: wif zup lug
Output: red yellow blue

Example 5:
Input: wif dax zup dax
Output: red green yellow green

Based on Example 1, it can be concluded that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

In Example 2, the addition of ""zup"" before ""wif"" adds ""yellow"" before ""red"" in the output, suggesting a one-to-one correspondence between input words and output colors (zup -> yellow, wif -> red).

Example 3 confirms this one-to-one correspondence, showing ""zup"" produces ""yellow,"" ""wif"" produces ""red,"" and ""walm"" also produces ""red."" This is our first sign that more than one word might produce the same output color, but more data is needed to confirm if ""walm"" always produces ""red"" or if there are more complex rules.

In Example 4, the output follows a one-to-one correspondence according to the position of the word in the input sequence: ""wif"" produces ""red,"" ""zup"" produces ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" produces ""blue.""

Example 5 further supports that ""wif"" maps to ""red"" regardless of its position, ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" maps to ""green.""

Based on the information provided, the rule for ""wif"" seems straightforward:

Rule: wif -> red

However, this rule is derived under the assumption that each word in the input directly maps to a color in the output based on the position and that each input word has a fixed corresponding color as an output. If more data were provided that contradicts this one-to-one positional mapping, the rule may need to be revised.
Based on the examples provided and the consistent outputs correlating with the presence of the nonce word ""zup,"" we can deduce the meaning of ""zup.""

When ""zup"" is present in the input, the output invariably starts with ""yellow."" In the absence of any other words, ""zup"" alone just outputs ""yellow."" Therefore, it appears that ""zup"" correlates directly to the color ""yellow.""

In all examples, ""zup"" appears to maintain this one-to-one relationship with ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence. This is shown by the fact that it precedes or follows other words while still outputting ""yellow"" in its respective position. There doesn't seem to be a positional rule or a contextual change in meaning depending on where ""zup"" is located in the sequence. 

However, to form a more comprehensive rule, we also need to consider the other words and their outputs. ""Wif"" consistently corresponds to a single ""red,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""red red red,"" hence their patterns are simpler to discern. ""Bluf"" is always followed by ""yellow red,"" but since ""zup"" already means ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" probably means just ""red.""

Conclusively, we can write the rule as:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the following pattern can be detected:

1. In ""wif bluf,"" the output is ""red red."" Here, ""bluf"" appears to replicate the color corresponding to the word preceding it (""wif"" -> ""red"").
   
2. ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" translates to ""green green red yellow red."" As before, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and results in a repeated color ""green,"" which corresponds to ""dax.""

3. ""lug zup bluf dax"" results in ""blue yellow yellow green."" In this sequence, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and results in another ""yellow,"" duplicating the color of the word just before it.

4. ""lug bluf"" produces ""blue blue,"" following the established pattern of duplicating the color associated with the preceding word.

5. Lastly, ""zup bluf wif dax lug"" gives us ""yellow yellow red green blue."" Once more, ""bluf"" after ""zup"" yields a second ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" can be defined as follows:

Rule: bluf -> Adopt the color associated with the immediately preceding word. If the preceding word translates to ""red,"" then bluf results in ""red,"" and similarly for other colors.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's break down each example and look for patterns:

1. ""wif lug walm"" outputs ""red blue blue blue."" 
2. ""dax lug walm"" outputs ""green blue blue blue.""
3. ""lug zup walm lug"" outputs ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue.""
4. ""wif walm zup"" outputs ""red red red yellow.""
5. ""dax wif walm"" outputs ""green red red red.""

We can notice that every time ""walm"" is used, the output color that follows is a repetition of the color corresponding to the word just before ""walm."" Here's how it breaks down:

1. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" we see ""blue blue blue,"" which corresponds to ""lug.""
2. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" we see ""blue blue blue"" again corresponding to ""lug.""
3. Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and the word directly after ""walm"" is another ""lug,"" yielding one more ""blue.""
4. ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" we get ""red red"" referring back to ""wif.""
5. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" we see ""red red"" again referring back to ""wif.""

Based on the provided examples, ""walm"" seems to cause the next part of the output to repeat the color that corresponds to the word just before ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> ""Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding 'walm' three times in the output.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,167
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" appears to translate consistently to the color blue, as every instance of ""lug"" in the inputs corresponds to ""blue"" in the outputs. To confirm this:

- In the first example, ""lug"" falls between ""walm"" (associated with yellow) and ""zup"" (also associated with yellow) and outputs ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" is followed by ""zup wif"" (which translates to yellow red) and precedes with ""blue.""
- In the third and fourth examples, the presence of ""lug"" consistently results in ""blue"" in the outputs, no matter its position or surrounding words.
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" precedes and follows ""walm wif"" (which translates to blue red), and both instances of ""lug"" results in ""blue.""

None of the contexts appears to change the meaning of ""lug.""

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: In these examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the provided examples, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, the output includes the word ""yellow"" at the same position. Other words in the input correspond to other colors consistently. For example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Therefore, the rule can be simply stated as:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" represents the color ""yellow.""
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns in the given input-output pairs, focusing on the presence of ""bluf"" and the colors in the output.

- In the first input, ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red blue green green."" ""Bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" which seems to map to ""green,"" and there are two greens in the output.
- In the second input, ""dax bluf zup"" corresponds to ""green green yellow."" ""Bluf"" is between ""dax"" and ""zup."" ""Dax"" is followed by ""green,"" and ""bluf"" seems to be followed by another ""green."" ""Zup"" maps to ""yellow.""
- In the third input, ""dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green red red."" Here, ""wif"" seems to map to ""red,"" and is followed by ""bluf,"" which also results in a ""red"" in the output.
- In the fourth input, ""wif bluf"" gives ""red red."" It's similar to the previous case, where ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" both leading to ""red.""
- The fifth input, ""wif walm lug bluf,"" yields ""red red red blue blue."" The first ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" followed by ""walm,"" which we don't have any additional information about, but it also leads to ""red."" ""Lug"" maps to ""blue,"" followed by ""bluf,"" resulting in another ""blue.""

Considering the information above, we can infer that ""bluf"" directly repeats the color mapped by the word that precedes it in the sequence (if there's a directly mapped color to that word). If ""bluf"" follows:

- ""dax"" (green), the result is ""green""
- ""wif"" (red), the result is ""red""
- ""lug"" (blue), the result is ""blue""

There's no clear result after ""walm,"" as we don't have an established mapping for that word. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" repeats the color of the word preceding it. 
Rule: If a color word is followed by ""bluf,"" then the color that the word represents is repeated in the output.
walm -> repetition. Rule: The word ""walm"" indicates that the previous color word's output should be repeated three times. For instance, if ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", then ""wif walm"" would correspond to ""red red red"". Here's the interpretation for each input phrase:

- ""wif"" is followed by ""zup"" and then ""walm"" which results in ""red yellow yellow yellow"", meaning ""walm"" causes the ""yellow"" to repeat three times after ""zup"".
- ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" which results in ""green green green"", so ""walm"" causes the ""green"" to repeat three times after ""dax"".
- ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"", which results in ""blue blue blue"", meaning ""walm"" causes the ""blue"" to repeat three times after ""lug"".
- In the input ""dax walm wif walm zup"", the presence of ""walm"" after ""dax"" causes ""green"" to be repeated three times, and its subsequent appearance after ""wif"" leads to ""red"" being repeated three times before the sequence ends with a ""yellow"" for ""zup"".
- Lastly, ""lug walm"" without any following color term simply results in a triple ""blue"" output.

Thus, the rule is that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word directly preceding it to be repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,168
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning: blue. Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the output is ""blue"".
From the given examples, it seems like each word corresponds to a specific color. By comparing the input and the output, we can deduce the color associated with each word. Notably, we are looking for the color associated with the nonce word ""dax.""

Here's the word-to-color mapping based on the given outputs:

- walm -> red
- wif -> red
- bluf -> red 
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

Now, let's see how ""dax"" fits in:

1. Input: ""dax walm wif bluf"" 
   Output: ""green green green red red"" 
   The two repeated words ""walm"" and ""wif"" both map to ""red,"" and since ""dax"" is the first word, it must correspond to the first color, which is ""green.""

2. Input: ""zup lug dax lug"" 
   Output: ""yellow blue green blue"" 
   ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" comes before the third color, which is ""green.""

3. Input: ""wif bluf dax"" 
   Output: ""red red green"" 
   Both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" map to ""red,"" and ""dax"" precedes the color ""green.""

4. Input: ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" 
   Output: ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow"" 
   Here, ""dax"" is followed by the color ""green"" again.

5. Input: ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" 
   Output: ""blue red blue green green"" 
   And once more, ""dax"" comes before ""green.""

Based on the consistent pattern across these examples, we can conclude the rule:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" 

Therefore, dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the given examples, regardless of its position or the occurrence of other words.
Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" I'll analyze the examples and try to find consistent patterns.

Analyzing the first example:
- Input: wif bluf
- Output: red red

We can see that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red"" since it's repeated in the output.

Considering the second example:
- Input: wif bluf dax
- Output: red red green

Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" and ""bluf"" both still correspond to ""red"".

Now, examining the third example:
- Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
- Output: blue green green red green

We can notice that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" is again matched with ""red"".

Looking at the fourth example:
- Input: lug wif lug bluf
- Output: blue red blue blue

Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" matches with ""blue."" This is the first example where ""bluf"" does not correspond to ""red"".

Lastly, the fifth example:
- Input: lug bluf
- Output: blue blue

In this example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""blue.""

Based on the third and fourth examples, it appears that ""bluf"" doesn't have a fixed color meaning but rather takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> The word ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that comes before it in the sequence.

This can be confirmed by the example where ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the color is ""red"" twice, but when ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the color is ""blue"" in both circumstances.
Based on the examples provided where the word ""walm"" is present and considering the output that follows, ""walm"" appears to replicate or repeat the color word before it a certain number of times. Analyzing each case:

- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"": ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes it to be repeated three times.
- ""dax lug dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue green blue blue blue"": Each word is directly translated to a color except for ""walm,"" which repeats the color before it (""blue"") three times.
- ""dax wif walm"" -> ""green red red red"": Here ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""wif"" is ""red"". ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times.
- Again, ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"" gives the same result as the first example.
- ""lug wif dax walm zup"" -> ""blue red green green green yellow"": ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and then ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times, followed by ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow.""

Given these observations, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color word directly before it three times.

Therefore:

walm -> Repeat the preceding color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm
    ",Output: blue blue blue,blue blue blue,True,169
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever lug appears in the input, it translates to ""blue"" in the output.
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine the patterns with respect to the corresponding outputs:

1. In the first example, every ""dax"" maps to ""green"" and every ""lug"" maps to ""blue"". ""Walm"" seems to map to ""blue"" as well, but it may be because it's repeated twice.

2. In the second example, ""dax"" again maps to ""green"". While the single ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""yellow"" followed by ""blue"", it seems ""walm"" continues to give multiple ""blue"" outputs.

3. In the third example, ""zup"" only appears once and maps to ""yellow"", while ""dax"" once again maps to ""green"".

4. In the fourth example, we see that ""lug"" still corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green"". Now the new word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

5. In the fifth example, the pattern continues with ""wif"" mapping to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""dax"" to ""green"".

From these examples, we can deduce ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green"". It does not depend on the context of its placement or how many times it appears.

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word 'zup', we must look for patterns in the given examples. Each example consists of the word 'zup' followed by other words, and the corresponding output is a series of color names. By examining what follows 'zup' and the corresponding colors that appear in the output, we can attempt to figure out the rule that 'zup' is following.

In every example where 'zup' appears, 'yellow' appears in the output:

- Input: zup wif lug -> Output: yellow red blue
- Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
- Input: zup lug zup bluf lug -> Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
- Input: zup lug bluf wif -> Output: yellow blue blue red
- Input: zup dax wif zup -> Output: yellow green red yellow

Regardless of what word follows 'zup', the word 'yellow' always appears in the corresponding output. In addition, 'yellow' only appears when 'zup' is present in the input. This persistent pairing suggests that there is a direct relationship between 'zup' and the color 'yellow'.

Therefore, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word 'zup' as follows:

Rule: zup -> 'yellow'
Based on the given examples, we can infer the following color-coded word pairs:

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue

In each instance, when ""bluf"" appears, the output color matches the color of the word that directly precedes it. Here's a breakdown of the evidence:

- In the first input ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""red.""
- In the second input ""zup dax bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""green.""
- In the third input ""zup bluf,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""yellow.""
- In the fourth input ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""green.""
- In the fifth input ""lug dax bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""green.""

According to these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the input sequence.

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is to replicate the color of the preceding word.
walm -> meaning. Based on the examples, the word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color-word, the output is that color word repeated three times. For instance:

- dax (green) lug (blue) walm -> green blue blue blue
- zup (yellow) walm -> yellow yellow yellow
- lug (blue) walm wif (red) bluf -> blue blue blue red red
- wif (red) walm -> red red red
- zup (yellow) walm lug (blue) wif (red) bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax zup wif walm
    ",Output: yellow green yellow red red red,yellow green yellow red red red,True,170
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""lug"" translates to a specific color. In each output, ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" There doesn't appear to be a context-dependent rule, so we can deduce a straightforward meaning for ""lug.""

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the given examples, every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding output position. There are no examples where ""dax"" corresponds to any other color or word. Therefore, it can be deduced that ""dax"" consistently means ""green.""
To deduce the rule for the word ""wif,"" let's look closely at the patterns where ""wif"" appears, and the corresponding output in each case.

1. ""wif"" is followed by ""dax"" and the output is ""red green.""
2. ""wif"" is followed by ""lug"" and the output is ""red blue.""
3. ""wif"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""dax,"" with the output being ""blue red green.""
4. ""zup wif walm"" outputs ""yellow red red red,"" where ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" which doesn't appear with it in any other given examples.
5. ""wif"" alone outputs ""red.""

From the above observations, we see that when ""wif"" is presented, the output is always ""red"" regardless of what follows it or if it is alone, and that ""wif"" changes the output of the word it precedes to be red. 

Rule: wif -> The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red,"" and it also turns the following word's corresponding color to ""red.""
To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze the context in which it appears and the corresponding output:

- ""zup wif bluf"" results in ""yellow red red."" Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""lug dax zup lug wif"" results in ""blue green yellow blue red."" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" again to ""yellow.""
- ""zup bluf wif bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow red red."" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" which means ""zup"" in the first position is ""yellow"" again.
- ""zup lug walm wif dax"" results in ""yellow blue blue blue red green."" The only unchanged color is ""yellow"" for ""zup.""
- ""zup dax walm zup wif"" results in ""yellow green green green yellow red."" Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

In every instance, ""zup"" precedes the word ""yellow"" in the output, no matter the position or context in the input sequence. 

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word that comes right before it. Here's how we can break it down:

Input 1: wif bluf -> Output 1: red red (bluf repeats the color of ""wif"")
Input 2: zup lug zup bluf lug -> Output 2: yellow blue yellow yellow blue (bluf repeats the color of ""zup"")
Input 3: wif bluf lug -> Output 3: red red blue (bluf repeats the color of ""wif"")
Input 4: lug bluf -> Output 4: blue blue (bluf repeats the color of ""lug"")
Input 5: dax lug bluf dax -> Output 5: green blue blue green (bluf repeats the color of ""lug"")

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning: repeats the color of the preceding word.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to involve repeating the color associated with the word prior to ""walm"" multiple times in the output. Observing each example:

- ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" produces ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow"", where ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (assigned red) and ""lug"" (assigned blue) and then the color repeats three times after each respective occurrence.
- ""dax lug walm"" yields ""green blue blue blue"", where ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and blue is repeated three times.
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"", which indicates that ""lug"" (blue) is followed by three repetitions of blue.
- ""zup walm wif"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow red"", where ""zup"" comes before ""walm"" and yellow is repeated three times before switching to the color associated with ""wif"" (red).
- ""dax walm lug"" translates to ""green green green blue"", where ""dax"" (green) precedes ""walm"" and the resulting color green is repeated three times before switching to the color associated with ""lug"" (blue).

Rule: The word ""walm"" leads to the color linked with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times in the output sequence. 

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup wif dax lug bluf zup
    ",Output: yellow red green blue blue yellow,yellow red green blue blue yellow,True,171
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: 

1. lug -> blue
2. wif -> red
3. dax -> green
4. zup -> yellow
5. walm -> yellow (repeating the last color mentioned)
6. bluf -> red (not enough examples to ascertain a distinct meaning, assumed based on single occurrence to repeat the previous color)

Given these mappings:

- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"".
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"".
- ""dax"" only appears once and is translated to ""green"".
- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"", and seems to be a repeating element based on its repetition in ""lug wif dax zup walm"". 
- ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and is also translated to ""yellow"", which could indicate it repeats the prior color or is specifically ""yellow"". With the available data, we cannot distinguish between these two possibilities.
- ""bluf"" appears in the context following ""wif"" and translates to ""red"". It is unclear if ""bluf"" has its own distinct color or if it is simply repeating the color associated with ""wif"". The examples are not sufficient to deduce a stand-alone meaning for ""bluf"".
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" is associated with the color green. In each instance where ""dax"" is used, the output includes the color green. Additionally, it seems that each word corresponds to a specific color, which can be determined by looking at the consistent patterns in the examples given:

- ""walm"" is consistently followed by three instances of the color yellow.
- ""lug"" is consistently followed by instances of the color blue.
- ""zup"" is consistently followed by an instance of the color yellow.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that each nonce word is associated with a specific color. The color is repeated depending on the word: ""walm"" repeats the color three times, ""lug"" maintains the quantity of the color as it appears in the input, and ""zup"" signifies the color once.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in all provided examples.
From the given examples, we can attempt to induce the rule governing the use of the nonce word ""zup."" To do this, we must look for a pattern across all examples where ""zup"" is present and its corresponding outputs.

In the first example ""Input: zup dax"" corresponds to ""Output: yellow green."" The word ""zup"" corresponds to the first color ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to the second color ""green."" 

Taking the second example ""Input: zup wif lug"" which corresponds to ""Output: yellow red blue,"" we see that ""zup"" is again tied to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is tied to ""red,"" and ""lug"" is tied to ""blue.""

With the third example ""Input: zup bluf dax,"" corresponding to ""Output: yellow yellow green,"" we can deduce that ""zup"" still corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" now corresponds to ""yellow"" too, and ""dax"" remains tied to ""green.""

In the fourth example ""Input: lug zup lug,"" corresponding to ""Output: blue yellow blue,"" the position of ""zup"" has moved but it still corresponds to ""yellow,"" while ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue.""

The final example shows a lengthy sequence, but the pattern of colors is consistent with the previous examples for the words ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" and ""dax."" 

Considering all five examples, the consistent rule that we can deduce is that the nonce word ""zup"" invariably corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" no matter its position in the sequence. Thus:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To determine the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" we need to examine each of the examples provided and look for patterns in their outputs. Let's consider each input and the corresponding output to look for such patterns.

Input: dax bluf wif zup dax
Output: green green red yellow green
Analysis: When ""bluf"" appears after ""dax"" and before ""wif,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red.

Input: wif lug bluf wif zup
Output: red blue blue red yellow
Analysis: When ""bluf"" appears after ""lug,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to the same color as ""lug,"" which is blue.

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red
Analysis: When ""bluf"" appears after ""wif,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to the same color as ""wif,"" which is red.

Input: zup bluf lug
Output: yellow yellow blue
Analysis: When ""bluf"" appears after ""zup,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to the same color as ""zup,"" which is yellow.

Input: wif lug bluf
Output: red blue blue
Analysis: This input is similar to the second one where ""bluf"" appears after ""lug,"" and again ""bluf"" corresponds to the same color as ""lug,"" blue.

Looking at the patterns, it seems that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. There is, however, one exception in the first input, where ""dax bluf wif"" results in ""green red yellow,"" but this could be because ""bluf"" is influenced by the word that immediately follows it in cases where ""bluf"" doesn't result in the same color as the previous word.

Rule:
bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.
Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" appears to be a word that represents repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. The number of repetitions is equal to the number of times the color has appeared so far plus one. Here's how the rule applies in each of the given examples:

1. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which means ""green"". ""Green"" has appeared once, so ""walm"" results in green being repeated two more times (for a total of three greens).

2. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   ""walm"" follows ""wif"", which means ""red"". ""Red"" has appeared once, so ""walm"" results in red being repeated two more times (for a total of three reds).

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which means ""yellow"". ""Yellow"" has not appeared before in this sequence, so ""walm"" results in yellow being repeated two times (for a total of three yellows).

4. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   The first ""walm"" follows the second ""lug"", which means ""blue"". ""Blue"" has appeared twice, so ""walm"" results in blue being repeated three more times (for a total of five blues).
   The second ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which means ""yellow"". ""Yellow"" has not appeared before in this sequence, so ""walm"" results in yellow being repeated two more times (for a total of three yellows).

5. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   The first ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which means ""blue"". ""Blue"" has appeared once, so ""walm"" results in blue being repeated two more times (for a total of three blues).
   The second ""walm"" follows the second ""lug"", which means ""blue"" again. ""Blue"" has appeared four times before this point, so ""walm"" results in blue being repeated five more times (for a total of nine blues, but the sequence stops at the seventh appearance).

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word, and do it the number of times it has appeared so far plus one.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the pattern observed in the examples, each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. Here's the correlation between the nonce words and the colors they represent as extracted from the examples:

- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- walm -> red

Every time the word ""lug"" appears, the output color is ""blue."" Therefore, the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" in this context can be deduced to correspond to the color blue.

Rule: lug -> blue
Given the examples, it seems that ""dax"" consistently leads to the output ""green."" Moreover, each other word in the inputs seems to correspond to a specific color in the outputs, with ""lug"" mapping to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" also to ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" appears quite straightforward:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the output is ""red"".
Based on the examples provided, each word seems to correlate to a specific color output. 

- ""dax"" always correlates to the output ""green"".
- ""lug"" always correlates to the output ""blue"".
- ""wif"" always correlates to the output ""red"".
- ""zup"" always correlates to the output ""yellow"".

Given these consistent mappings, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> red. Rule: The word ""bluf"" in the input corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it, resulting in a sequence of that color.

Explanation:

- In the first example, ""wif dax zup walm"" translates to ""red green yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" and the output is two additional ""yellow"" words after ""zup,"" which implies ""walm"" might mean to repeat the last color mentioned, which is ""yellow"" here.
  
- In the second example, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" leads to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" Once again, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), and two more ""yellow"" is the output, consistent with the first example's rule.
  
- In the third example, ""wif walm zup,"" the ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), resulting in ""red red red,"" suggesting ""walm"" repeats ""red"" two more times.

- In the fourth example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" showing that ""walm"" repeats ""lug"" (blue) two more times.

- Finally, in the fifth example ""wif walm dax zup,"" the ""walm"" is after ""wif"" (red), and results in ""red red red"" before the pattern continues with ""green yellow"" for ""dax zup.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it repeats the color of the word preceding it, duplicating it two more times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" Each time the word ""lug"" is used in the input, the color ""blue"" appears in the corresponding output. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. 

Therefore: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""wif"" consistently translates to the word ""red."" 

Regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the sequence or the other words around it, its output is always ""red."" Additionally, other words in the inputs seem to correspond to specific colors: for example, ""lug"" always translates to ""blue"" and ""dax"" always translates to ""green."" 

Here is the rule based on the given examples:

wif -> red

This means: ""wif"" means ""red"".
Based on the given examples, it appears that each word translates to a specific color. Let's map the words to corresponding colors to figure out what ""zup"" means.

From Input 1:
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> yellow
- dax -> green

From the other inputs, we see consistent mappings that confirm these translations.

Given this, examining the use of ""zup"" in the examples:

Input 2:
- zup wif -> yellow red

This shows that ""zup"" directly translates to ""yellow"" in the presence of ""wif"" which translates to ""red"".

Input 3:
- zup bluf lug -> yellow yellow blue

Again, ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"" which has so far translated to ""yellow"", and then by ""lug"", which translates to ""blue"".

Input 4:
- lug wif zup wif walm -> blue red yellow red red red

In this sequence, ""zup"" follows ""wif"" (red) and is followed by another ""wif"" (red), and it translates to ""yellow"".

Input 5:
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow

When followed by ""bluf"" (yellow), ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" again.

From all these examples, we can deduce:

Rule: ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"", regardless of the context in the sequence.

Therefore:
zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rules governing the use of the word ""bluf.""

1. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
2. dax wif bluf -> green red red
3. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
4. wif bluf zup -> red red yellow
5. zup bluf -> yellow yellow

It appears that the output is a sequence of colors ""green,"" ""yellow,"" or ""red"" that relate to the sequence of input words. The word ""bluf"" consistently results in ""green"" when it follows ""dax"" and ""yellow"" when it either precedes ""dax,"" follows ""zup"" or is immediately preceded by ""zup."" Meanwhile, ""bluf"" results in ""red"" when it follows ""wif.""

Rule:
- If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""
- If ""bluf"" is either preceded or followed by ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow.""
- If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""

However, since we do not know what ""bluf"" means, we can only deduce the rule based on the given pattern, not the exact meaning of the word. It's possible that the meaning of ""bluf"" itself may vary depending on the word that comes before or after it in these examples. Nonetheless, the consistent rule we can establish is related to the positional context of ""bluf"" with respect to other words.

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the word adjacent to it, affecting the color output in the pattern provided. Given these limitations, the rule appears to be positional rather than semantic.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the inputs and corresponding outputs. 

1. Every time ""walm"" appears, one color appears repeatedly in the output thereafter.
2. The color that repeats corresponds to the color of the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

Here are the examples mapping inputs to outputs:

- ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> red red green green green
- ""zup walm"" -> yellow yellow yellow
- ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
- ""lug walm dax"" -> blue blue blue green
- ""wif walm dax zup"" -> red red red green yellow

From these examples, we can infer:
- After ""wif bluf dax walm,"" the color green is repeated three times.
- After ""zup walm,"" the color yellow is repeated three times.
- After ""zup lug zup walm,"" the color yellow is repeated three times following ""walm.""
- After ""lug walm,"" the color blue is repeated three times.
- After ""wif walm,"" the color red is repeated three times.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the next color to be repeated thrice. We can deduce the rule for ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

    ",Output: red blue,red blue,True,174
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of context.

Rule: lug means blue.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to look at the provided examples and identify any patterns or consistent occurrences that correlate with the input and output sequences. Here's what we have:

1. ""dax walm wif dax"" corresponds to ""green green green red green""
2. ""dax"" on its own corresponds to ""green""
3. ""dax walm wif"" corresponds to ""green green green red""
4. ""dax"" on its own corresponds to ""green""
5. ""dax"" on its own corresponds to ""green""

Looking at the outputs, the word ""dax"" consistently correlates with the output ""green,"" except in one instance where ""dax"" is at the end of the sequence, it correlates with ""red."" However, there is not enough data to conclude that ""dax"" at the end always corresponds to ""red,"" because there is only one instance of this, and it could be another word in the sequence that triggers the ""red"" output (e.g., ""wif""). More data would be needed to support this pattern.

From what we can consistently observe, ""dax"" correlates with ""green.""

Rule:
dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Every time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the color red is present in the same position in the output.

Rule: wif -> red.
To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" let's examine the outputs associated with ""zup"" in each input:

1. Input: zup
   Output: yellow
   - Here, ""zup"" directly translates to ""yellow.""

2. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   - ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"" and ""lug,"" which result in two additional repetitions of ""yellow."" Following those, ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""bluf"" to ""blue."" Perhaps ""lug"" indicates the repetition of the color that comes before it.

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - Again, ""walm"" after ""zup"" seems to cause a repetition of ""yellow.""

4. Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
   Output: green yellow red red blue
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" suggesting that it's not influenced by ""zup."" ""zup"" remains ""yellow."" ""wif"" gives ""red,"" and ""bluf"" gives ""blue."" ""lug"" does not cause a repetition of ""blue,"" which suggests that ""lug"" repeats the previous color only when it follows ""walm.""

5. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" follows ""zup"" and translates to ""blue,"" followed by ""walm,"" which again causes a repetition, this time of ""blue."" The placement of ""lug"" and ""walm"" seems significant in determining repetition.

Based on this analysis, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow."" Additionally, ""walm"" following ""zup"" results in repetition, and ""lug"" repeats the previous color, but only when it follows ""walm.""

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the examples provided, it is possible to deduce that ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""bluf."" To confirm this, we look at each example:

- In the first input, ""dax bluf"" leads to ""green green,"" indicating that ""bluf"" results in repeating the color of ""dax,"" which is green.
- The second input is ""dax bluf"" with the same ""green green"" output, confirming the earlier observation.
- The third input is ""lug bluf,"" which results in ""blue blue,"" so ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""lug,"" which is blue.
- In the fourth example, ""wif zup bluf"" yields ""red yellow yellow."" Here ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and repeats its color, yellow.
- Finally, the fifth input, ""wif bluf dax,"" creates an output of ""red red green."" ""Bluf"" appears after ""wif"" and before ""dax,"" and it repeats the color of ""wif,"" which is red.

Therefore, the rule for the word ""bluf"" is to duplicate the color of the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.
Based on the provided input and output examples, the word ""walm"" seems to be a keyword that repeats a color that corresponds to the word directly preceding it. Each time ""walm"" appears, the color that was generated by the previous word is repeated three times.

Here is how the word ""walm"" functions in each example:

- In the first input ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" outputs a single ""blue,"" and then the ""walm"" causes the output to repeat ""blue"" three times.
- In the second example ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" outputs a single ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" produces three repetitions of ""yellow.""
- Similarly, for ""zup walm lug,"" we see ""yellow"" repeated three times due to ""walm,"" and then ""lug"" adds one ""blue"" to the output.
- When looking at ""zup dax walm zup wif,"" the word ""zup"" yields one ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" produces ""green."" The occurrence of ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in three ""green"" in the output. Then ""zup"" produces one more ""yellow,"" followed by ""wif,"" which seems to output ""red.""
- In the ""lug walm zup walm"" example, ""lug"" gives us ""blue,"" followed by ""walm"" that repeats ""blue"" three times. Then, ""zup"" provides ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the color corresponding to the word directly preceding it to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
Given the examples, it appears the rule is that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Therefore:

wif -> red

Rule: Each instance of ""wif"" in the input is replaced with ""red"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Every time the word ""zup"" is used in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the exact same position in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> red when following wif, green when following or followed by dax, and yellow when following zup. In other cases, bluf translates to blue. Rule: The meaning of bluf changes based on the word that immediately precedes it.
Based on the given examples, the pattern for the word ""walm"" seems to involve the repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" Let's verify this with the examples:

1. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue red green,"" where ""lug"" (blue) is immediately before ""walm"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times.

2. ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" translates to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue,"" where again ""lug"" (blue) occurs right before ""walm"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times.

3. ""lug walm zup"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow,"" where ""lug"" (blue) precedes ""walm"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times.

4. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" where ""dax"" (green) precedes ""walm"" and ""green"" is repeated three times.

5. ""wif walm lug bluf"" translates to ""red red red blue blue,"" where ""wif"" (red) precedes ""walm"" and ""red"" is repeated three times.

So the inferred rule is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before walm three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,176
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each example.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif"" from the provided examples, let's look at the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

- ""zup dax zup wif"" maps to ""yellow green yellow red""
- ""lug bluf wif"" maps to ""blue blue red""
- ""dax walm wif walm"" maps to ""green green green red red red""
- ""zup walm wif"" maps to ""yellow yellow yellow red""
- ""wif lug"" maps to ""red blue""

Firstly, we notice that every instance of ""wif"" in the input translates to ""red"" in the output. Therefore, there might be a direct mapping from ""wif"" to ""red.""

Secondly, the presence of ""wif"" does not seem to affect the color translation of the words that precede it but seems to influence the number of times a color appears afterward when there are additional words following it. For example, in ""dax walm wif walm,"" ""dax walm walm"" without ""wif"" would likely map to ""green green green,"" but with ""wif,"" it maps to ""green green green red red red."" Here, ""wif"" appears before the last ""walm,"" and we see an additional ""red"" appended for each instance of ""walm"" following the ""wif.""

Given these observations, we can formulate the following rule for ""wif"":

wif -> meaning: ""wif"" translates to the color ""red,"" and if there are any words following ""wif,"" the color associated with those words is repeated the same number of times as the word occurs after ""wif."" 

Rule: If ""wif"" appears in an input, translate it to ""red,"" and repeat the translation of any word that follows ""wif"" the number of times that word appears after ""wif.""
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: Whenever the word bluf appears, the next word is translated to the color blue, and bluf itself is translated to the color red. 

Bluf -> red, but it causes the following word to be translated as blue.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look for the patterns in the inputs and outputs.

The output is a sequence of colors. By comparing inputs with their corresponding outputs, we can attempt to find a correlation between the words and the color sequence.

Here's a breakdown of the inputs and outputs:

1. ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue""
2. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
3. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" -> ""green green green yellow blue blue blue""
4. ""lug wif dax walm zup"" -> ""blue red green green green yellow""
5. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""

From the given examples, we can observe the following:

- ""wif"" translates to ""red"" (Example 1).
- ""dax"" translates to ""green"" (Example 2 and Example 3).
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" (Examples 1, 2, 4, and 5).
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" (Example 3 and Example 4).

The word ""walm"" appears to correspond consistently with a sequence of three ""blue"" colors in the output. This is evident because every time ""walm"" is in the input, there are three ""blue"" colors in sequence in the output.

Additionally, there is no variance in the output color sequence for ""walm"" irrespective of the preceding word—which can be ""wif,"" ""dax,"" or ""lug""—indicating that ""walm"" likely adds independent meaning that does not change based on context.

Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> ""blue blue blue"" (a sequence of three ""blue"" colors).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif walm lug
    ",Output: red red red blue,red red red blue,True,177
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the outputs.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" always corresponds to the color ""green.""
Analyzing the given inputs and outputs, it appears that each word corresponds to a color, and the word ""wif"" affects the sequence of colors being output. Here's what we know from the examples:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""walm"" also corresponds to ""green.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to an unknown color, but we see ""red"" appear right after ""wif"" in the sequences.

Let's work through the examples:

1. In the first sequence, after ""wif"" comes ""walm zup,"" and the output is ""red red red yellow."" Without ""wif,"" we would expect ""green yellow,"" so ""wif"" seems to be causing some repetition before moving on to the next color.

2. In the second sequence, ""wif"" comes before ""walm zup lug zup walm,"" and the output is ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" This follows the same pattern of having three ""reds"" before proceeding with the usual sequence of colors.

3. In the third sequence, ""wif"" is at the end before ""bluf,"" ending with ""red red."" Given we don't know what ""bluf"" means, but it's consistently followed by ""red"" when preceded by ""wif,"" we may infer ""wif"" causes ""bluf"" to output ""red.""

4. In the fourth sequence, ""wif"" appears twice, first before ""lug,"" then before ""walm lug."" After ""wif,"" ""lug"" is followed by ""red blue,"" and ""walm"" by ""red red red blue."" Thus, it suggests that ""wif"" affects the words following it differently based on the context.

5. In the last example, ""dax walm wif bluf"" outputs ""green green green red red."" So after ""dax"" and ""walm,"" which are both ""green,"" ""wif"" causes ""bluf"" to output ""red"" twice.

One more thing we can observe is that ""wif"" is affecting not only the number of times ""red"" appears but also the number of repetitions of the color that comes after ""wif.""

From this analysis, a possible rule for ""wif"" could be:

Rule: The word ""wif"" indicates that the color corresponding to the next word will be output as ""red,"" and the number of times ""red"" is output is determined by the position of the next word after ""wif"" in the original sequence with some repetitive pattern based on the following words.

Given the complexity and inconsistency of when and how many times ""red"" appears, it is difficult to define a precise rule without additional examples or information. Therefore, the rule stated above is the best approximation based on the provided data.

The rule would then be formatted as:
wif -> Causes the following word's color to change to ""red,"" with the number of repetitions likely influenced by the following words' usual color sequence or their position in the sequence.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the examples given.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that ""bluf"" immediately repeats the color that corresponds to the word that comes immediately before it. Here is how we can deduce the pattern:

1. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" repeats that color.

2. Input: dax lug bluf wif
   Output: green blue blue red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""bluf"" repeats that color then ""wif"" is red.

3. Input: zup bluf lug dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow blue green blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""bluf"" repeats that color.

4. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""bluf"" repeats that color.

5. Input: dax lug bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""bluf"" repeats that color.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the word immediately before it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the correspondence between the inputs and outputs across the examples. We see that ""walm"" invariably results in a repetition in the color output:

1. zup wif lug zup walm -> yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
The color sequence repeats ""yellow,"" which was the color associated with ""zup"" before ""walm.""

2. dax walm wif -> green green green red
The color ""green"" associated with ""dax"" repeats immediately after ""walm.""

3. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
""Red,"" the color associated with ""wif,"" is repeated after ""walm.""

4. dax walm -> green green green
Again, ""green"" associated with ""dax"" is repeated after ""walm.""

5. dax wif walm -> green red red red
""Red,"" the color associated with ""wif,"" is repeated after ""walm.""

Given these observations, it seems that the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times in the color output. Therefore:

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,178
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue.

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every given example.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" seems to correspond to the color ""green"" in the output. Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" is included in the output at the corresponding position. Other words in the input, like ""wif"" and ""bluf,"" correspond to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" From this pattern, the rule is determined as follows:

dax -> green. Rule: Each nonce word in the input is associated with a specific color in the output. ""dax"" is consistently associated with the color ""green.""
Based on the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, there seems to be a pattern where each word is translated to a specific color:

- The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- The word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- The word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- The word ""bluf"" duplicates the color mentioned just before it, hence ""red red.""
- The word ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

From these observations, the rule appears to be that each word has a corresponding color output. Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" can be deduced as follows:

wif -> red. Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow.""

Here are the translations based on the input and output examples:

- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- walm -> repeats the color of the previous word

The rules seem consistent across all examples, and therefore, the meaning of ""zup"" is straightforward:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine how it interacts with other words in the examples and the corresponding outputs:

1. wif bluf zup -> red red yellow
2. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
3. wif bluf -> red red
4. lug bluf -> blue blue
5. wif bluf -> red red

In each example, the presence of ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" in the output, except in the combination of ""lug bluf,"" which corresponds to ""blue blue."" Notably, ""wif"" appears three times and the presence of ""wif"" with ""bluf"" yields ""red red,"" regardless of the presence of ""zup"" or not. ""dax"" in contrast with ""bluf"" and ""zup"" yields ""green yellow yellow,"" which suggests that ""dax"" may alter the color associated with ""bluf.""

Based on the inputs and outputs given, it seems most consistent to think of ""bluf"" as translating to ""red,"" with a possible rule exception when other specific words modify the color in a relevant way. For instance, ""lug"" seems to change the output color to ""blue"" when combined with ""bluf.""

Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" but this can be modified by the presence of other specific words. The word ""lug"" combined with ""bluf"" changes the output to ""blue.""
walm -> repeating the color of the previous word in the input.

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word in the series, as many times as the preceding word appears before ""walm."" 

In the first example, ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"" since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and appears three times in a row. In the second and third examples, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"" as ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and there's one ""lug"" before ""walm"". In the fourth example, ""lug walm"" still corresponds to ""blue blue blue"", and in the fifth, ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green"" with ""dax"" meaning ""green"" and being repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the outputs.
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
Based on the given examples, it seems that each nonce word (e.g., 'wif', 'zup', 'lug', 'bluf', 'dax') corresponds to a color. When a word is repeated, its corresponding color is also repeated. When 'wif' appears in any position in the input, 'red' always appears in the corresponding position in the output.

From the examples:

- When the input is 'wif' alone, the output is 'red'.
- When 'wif' appears after other words, the output sequence contains 'red' in the position where 'wif' appears.
- The sequence ""walm wif walm"" provides a sequence ""blue red red"", indicating that 'wif' is not influenced by the words around it (in this case 'walm') and maintains its meaning.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each instance where ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output, in the same position relative to the other colors.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> green

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the provided examples step by step:

1. When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green."" Thus, ""dax"" might mean ""green,"" and ""walm"" could be a repetition of the previously mentioned color three times.

2. For the second example, ""lug"" precedes ""zup walm lug,"" with the output being ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" This suggests that ""lug"" means ""blue,"" ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" continues to represent a triplication of the color mentioned just before it.

3. The third example, ""dax lug wif walm,"" with the output ""green blue red red red"" supports our deduction that ""dax"" means ""green"" and ""lug"" means ""blue."" ""Wif"" appears to mean ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats the color ""red"" three times. 

4. The fourth example is ""zup walm"" with the output ""yellow yellow yellow."" This is consistent with our understanding that ""zup"" means ""yellow"" and ""walm"" means tripling the color mentioned before it.

5. Lastly, ""zup walm wif"" with the output ""yellow yellow yellow red"" reinforces the role of ""wif"" as ""red"" and shows that ""walm"" does not influence any words that follow it.

Thus, ""walm"" means to take the color indicated by the word directly preceding it and triplicate that color in the output.

Rule: walm -> Triplicate the color denoted by the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The position of ""lug"" in the input does not change its output; it consistently translates to ""blue"" regardless of its position relative to other words.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color green regardless of its position in the input sequence. Each instance of ""dax"" consistently results in ""green"" in the output.
By analyzing the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"". Let's look at the correspondence between the inputs and outputs:

- Whenever the word ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red.""
- The presence of other words besides ""wif"" leads to different colors in the output, but ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red.""

Examples:
- Input: ""wif lug"" -> Output: ""red blue."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- Input: ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" -> Output: ""red red blue green red."" Each occurrence of ""wif"" maps to ""red.""
- Input: ""lug wif walm"" -> Output: ""blue red red red."" ""Wif"" once again maps to ""red.""
- Input: ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> Output: ""red red green green green."" ""Bluf"" and ""dax"" occur once, and ""walm"" thrice in a row, each ""wif"" still maps to ""red.""
- Input: ""wif dax wif"" -> Output: ""red green red."" ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

From the above, it seems that the word ""wif"" maps to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position or the context it is in. This would be our rule.

Rule: wif -> red
To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" let's examine the patterns of inputs and their corresponding outputs.

1. lug walm zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow red
2. zup lug zup lug -> yellow blue yellow blue
3. dax zup dax -> green yellow green
4. wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> red blue blue yellow yellow green
5. wif zup -> red yellow

From the examples given, each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. By looking at where ""zup"" appears and what color it corresponds to in the output, we can deduce its meaning.

In the first example, ""zup"" is followed by ""wif,"" and the colors are ""blue yellow"" respectively. However, looking at example five ""wif zup,"" the result is ""red yellow."" Therefore, ""wif"" produces ""red,"" and it's consistent that ""zup"" produces ""yellow.""

Looking at the second example, ""zup"" is before and after ""lug,"" and the colors are ""yellow blue yellow blue"" respectively. ""lug"" consistently gives ""blue,"" while ""zup"" remains ""yellow.""

In the third example, ""zup"" is between two ""dax,"" which produce ""green."" The pattern here is ""green yellow green,"" confirming that ""zup"" produces ""yellow.""

In the fourth example, ""zup"" is surrounded by ""bluf,"" which results in ""blue yellow yellow."" Since ""dax"" at the end produces ""green,"" the previous ""yellow"" much be from ""zup"" again, which matches the other occurrences.

Thus, from the given examples, ""zup"" always corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"":

1. In every example, the word ""bluf"" directly follows another word.
2. Each time ""bluf"" appears, the output color is the same as the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"".
3. This pattern holds true regardless of the word that precedes ""bluf""; the output color for ""bluf"" is always the same color as the word before it.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> the same color associated with the word preceding it.

For example:
- When ""wif"" (which corresponds to red) precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""red red"".
- When ""lug"" (which corresponds to blue) precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""blue blue"".
- When ""dax"" (which corresponds to green) precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""green green"".
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the pattern of colors associated with the other words when ""walm"" is present.

From the examples given:

1. lug -> blue
2. wif -> red
3. dax -> green
4. zup -> yellow

Now let's analyze where ""walm"" appears:

1. lug wif dax walm zup: blue red green green green yellow
   After ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated twice before a change.

2. zup dax lug walm zup lug: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   Again, after ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated twice before a change.

3. zup bluf wif walm: yellow yellow red red red
   Here, after ""walm"", ""red"" is repeated twice.

4. lug walm zup wif: blue blue blue yellow red
   After ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated once before a change.

5. lug dax walm wif: blue green green green red
   After ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated once before a change.

It seems that ""walm"" affects the output by repeating the color associated with the word just before it. However, in examples 4 and 5, the repeat count differs from examples 1, 2, and 3. This suggests that whether the color repeats once or twice might be influenced by an additional factor.

Looking closer, it seems that when ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" (which means yellow), the color before ""walm"" repeats only once (as in examples 4 and 5). When ""walm"" is not followed immediately by ""zup"", the color repeats twice (as in examples 1, 2, and 3).

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word just before it to repeat, and the number of repetitions depends on whether the following word is ""zup"" (yellow) or not.

Rule:
walm -> Repeats the color of the previous word in the sequence. If ""zup"" follows ""walm"", the color is repeated once, otherwise, it is repeated twice.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, each unique word is associated with a specific color. Here's what we can induce for the words wif, zup, walm, lug, and dax:

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> green
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green

The word ""dax"" consistently maps to the color green in each example. Therefore, the meaning of ""dax"" could be determined as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word bluf corresponds to the color yellow in the given output regardless of its position or the context within the sentence.
Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word.

In the given examples, when the nonce word ""walm"" is used, the output is the color associated with the word preceding ""walm,"" repeated one or more times depending on the context.

Here is a breakdown of the examples provided:

Example 1: ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" so it also corresponds to ""red""
- The sequence ends with another ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue""
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

Example 2: ""dax zup dax walm""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" so it also corresponds to ""green""
Output: green yellow green green green

Example 3: ""zup walm wif""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" so it also corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" but is not influenced by ""walm""
Output: yellow yellow yellow red

Example 4: ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug""
- ""lug"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" so it repeats ""yellow""
- Ending with ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue""
Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Example 5: ""lug walm wif""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" so it also corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
Output: blue blue blue red

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" in the given context appears to be that it repeats the color associated with the preceding word in the sequence. Given this pattern, we can determine:

walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup dax wif
    ",Output: green yellow green green red,green yellow green red,False,182
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can observe a pattern as follows:

- The output for ""lug"" alone is always blue.
- When ""lug"" is combined with other words, its output is still blue.
- The presence of other words in the input like ""dax,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" and ""zup"" correspond to different colors in the output (like ""dax"" assuming to be green, ""walm"" to be either green or blue, ""wif"" to be red, and ""zup"" to be yellow).

Taking these observations into account, and focusing solely on the occurrences of ""lug"", we can deduce that:

lug -> meaning: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue regardless of the context in which it appears in the given examples.

Rule: ""lug"" is consistently associated with the color blue in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: Each instance of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.
To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" it's crucial to observe the output corresponding to each instance where ""wif"" is present in the input:

1. ""dax wif zup"" corresponds to ""green red yellow.""
2. ""wif lug"" corresponds to ""red blue.""
3. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red.""
4. ""lug wif"" corresponds to ""blue red.""
5. ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" corresponds to ""blue green green yellow blue red.""

Based on these examples, we can see that each time ""wif"" is present, the color ""red"" appears in the output. Additionally, ""red"" is always preceded by another color in the output, which corresponds to whatever word immediately precedes ""wif"" in the input. For example, when ""dax"" precedes ""wif,"" the color ""green"" precedes ""red"" in the output. When ""lug"" precedes ""wif,"" ""blue"" precedes ""red"" in the output.

Therefore, based on these observations, the rule for ""wif"" can be determined as follows:

Rule: ""wif"" indicates the color ""red"" in the output and also dictates that the color associated with the word immediately before ""wif"" in the input should be placed before ""red"" in the output.

So, wif -> meaning: When ""wif"" appears in the input, output ""red,"" preceded by the color that corresponds to the word immediately before ""wif.""
Based on the examples provided, the rule regarding the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" seems to be:

zup -> ""yellow""

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
bluf -> the repeated color indicated by the word immediately preceding ""bluf"".

Rule: When the word bluf is used, it takes the color meaning of the word right before it and duplicates that color in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we analyze the output colors corresponding to each example where ""walm"" appears.

Here are the instances:
1. dax walm zup lug -> green green green yellow blue
2. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue
3. dax walm -> green green green
4. dax wif walm lug zup -> green red red red blue yellow
5. zup walm lug wif -> yellow yellow yellow blue red

Our goal is to find a pattern in the output that correlates uniquely to whenever ""walm"" is present.

From examples 1 and 3, we can see that ""dax"" before ""walm"" results in repeated ""green,"" which suggests that ""walm"" might replicate the color corresponding to the word just prior to it (since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"").

Example 2 has ""lug walm"" at the end, with the output being ""blue blue."" This further supports the hypothesis as ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" before ""walm.""

Example 4 includes ""wif walm lug zup"" which results in ""red red red blue yellow."" Here again, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which translates to ""red,"" and right after ""walm,"" we see repeated ""red.""

Example 5 has ""zup walm lug wif"" translating to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red."" Similarly to the previous examples, after ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" we have ""walm"" followed by more ""yellow.""

From these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the word it follows.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color associated with the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax walm lug
    ",Output: blue green green blue,blue green green green blue,False,183
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that 'lug' translates to the color 'blue'. Here's how this conclusion is arrived at:

- In every input where 'lug' appears, the word 'blue' appears the same number of times in the output.
- The position of 'lug' in the input corresponds to the position of 'blue' in the output.

To illustrate:

- Input: dax wif lug -> Output: green red blue ('lug' is the third word and 'blue' is the third color)
- Input: zup lug -> Output: yellow blue ('lug' is the second word and 'blue' is the second color)
- Input: lug bluf -> Output: blue blue ('lug' is the first word and 'blue' is the first color)
- Input: zup lug walm wif walm -> Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red ('lug' corresponds to the first 'blue')
- Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif -> Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red ('lug' corresponds to 'blue' whenever it appears)

Rule:
lug -> blue
From the provided examples, it seems that ""dax"" is used as a modifier that changes the color output according to a certain rule. Let's attempt to analyze the pattern:

- dax wif -> green red
  Here, ""dax"" precedes ""wif"" and we get the output ""green red"".

- dax wif walm -> green red red red
  In this example, ""wif"" after ""dax"" still results in ""green red"", and ""walm"" results in an additional ""red"". 

- dax bluf -> green green
  With ""dax"" preceding ""bluf"", we see the output is ""green green"", which might mean that ""bluf"" corresponds to just a single green when affected by ""dax"".

- lug wif dax -> blue red green
  Here, ""dax"" comes at the end, and we see that the first word ""lug"" leads to ""blue"", ""wif"" leads to ""red"", and then ""dax"" by itself seems to add a ""green"".

- dax zup walm wif -> green yellow yellow yellow red
  Again, ""dax"" at the start changes the pattern. ""zup"" seems to correspond to a sequence of ""yellow"", and ""walm wif"" at the end again results in ""yellow red"".

Combining these insights, we may interpret ""dax"" as a modifier that specifies the color output for the succeeding words. Specifically, ""dax"" by itself might mean ""green"", and when paired with other words, it influences the color they correspond to. For example, ""wif"" normally corresponds to ""red"", but when it comes after ""dax"", it causes the output ""green red"". For ""bluf"", which perhaps usually corresponds to ""blue"", it yields ""green green"" instead.

To solidify the rule, we'd need more examples with different word positions and combinations. However, based on what we have, we can say the following:

Rule: ""dax"" changes the color corresponding to the following word(s), and if it stands alone, it corresponds to ""green"". When ""dax"" precedes ""wif"", it causes ""green red""; when followed by ""bluf"", it becomes ""green green""; ""walm"" after ""dax"" becomes ""red"", and ""zup"" becomes ""yellow"". If ""dax"" is at the end or is by itself, it results in ""green"".
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. Here are the observed correlations:

- In the first example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" which corresponds to ""red"" preceding ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""zup wif"" translates directly to ""yellow red.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" is surrounded by two instances of ""red"" in the output.
- In the fourth example, after ""wif,"" two ""red"" words appear in the output, regardless of what precedes ""wif.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" is again followed by ""red"" in the output sequence.

This suggests a direct mapping between the nonce word ""wif"" and the color ""red"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, there seems to be a consistent pattern where each standalone word translates to a specific color as follows:

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> red

The word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the other words around it. Therefore, we can conclude the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" is:

zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> ""the same color as the following word"" 

In each example, the color corresponding to ""bluf"" is the same as the color that immediately follows it:
- ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" translates to ""blue red green green red blue,"" with ""bluf wif"" resulting in ""green red.""
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green,"" with ""bluf dax"" resulting in ""red green.""
- ""zup bluf lug dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue green blue,"" with ""bluf lug"" resulting in ""yellow blue.""
- ""lug bluf zup lug"" translates to ""blue blue yellow blue,"" with ""bluf zup"" resulting in ""blue yellow.""
- ""dax bluf zup"" translates to ""green green yellow,"" with ""bluf zup"" resulting in ""green yellow.""
walm -> meaning. Based on the examples, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the previous word three times. For example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" and ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green.""

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the color output for that word is repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm
    ",Output: green green green,green green green,True,184
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the meaning of the word ""lug"" by looking at the corresponding output for each input. In each instance where ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output. There are no counterexamples to this pattern provided in the inputs and outputs:

- In the first input, ""lug"" corresponds to the second occurrence of ""green"" in the output, but considering the rest of the data, this seems to be an inconsistency with the use of ""dax"" which consistently corresponds to ""green.""
- In the second input, ""lug"" appears once and corresponds to the last color, which is ""blue.""
- In the third input, ""lug"" is the first word and the output starts with ""blue.""
- In the fourth input, ""lug"" appears twice, alternating with ""zup,"" and each time ""lug"" appears, ""blue"" follows.
- In the fifth input, ""lug"" is in the middle and again corresponds to ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: Each word in the input is associated with a specific color in the output. ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in each example. ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and the repetition of ""walm"" after ""lug"" suggests that it may represent additional instances of the color ""blue."" Similarly, ""wif"" translates to ""red."" Each word is mapped to its corresponding color irrespective of its position in the sentence.
Based on the provided examples, we can induce a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" as it correlates to a specific color in the Output.

Here's what we can gather from the examples:

1. Wherever ""wif"" appears in the Input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the Output.
2. Each output color is consistent for other words too (lug -> blue, dax -> green, zup -> yellow, bluf -> red).

Thus, the rule appears to be:

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Hence:

wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to infer the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" by analyzing the patterns and the corresponding outputs. The consistent factor in each example is that whenever ""zup"" appears as part of the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output.

Examples provided:

- Input: ""zup"" corresponds to Output: ""yellow""
- Input: ""zup"" corresponds to Output: ""yellow""
- Input: ""dax walm wif zup"" corresponds to Output: ""green green green red yellow""
- Input: ""wif zup dax"" corresponds to Output: ""red yellow green""
- Input: ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif"" corresponds to Output: ""blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red""

Despite the inclusion of other nonce words such as ""dax,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" and ""lug,"" with their corresponding outputs occurring in patterns (suggesting each has its unique color association), the word ""zup"" is consistently associated with the output ""yellow."" It's also apparent that the position of ""zup"" in the input does not affect its corresponding output, which remains ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the series of words.
By analyzing the provided examples where the nonce word ""bluf"" is used, we can attempt to deduce its meaning or the rule(s) it follows:

1. In the first example, the word ""bluf"" corresponds with the color green:
   - Input: ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug""
   - Output: ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue""

2. The second example also associates ""bluf"" with the color yellow:
   - Input: ""zup bluf""
   - Output: ""yellow yellow""

3. The third example does not contain ""bluf,"" but based on the consistency, we can infer that ""wif"" is red and ""dax"" is green:
   - Input: ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif""
   - Output: ""red green red red yellow red""

4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is associated with the color green again:
   - Input: ""lug wif lug dax bluf""
   - Output: ""blue red blue green green""

5. The fifth example associates ""bluf"" with the color blue:
   - Input: ""lug bluf wif lug bluf zup""
   - Output: ""blue blue red blue blue yellow""

Given the inconsistency in the color associated with the word ""bluf"" across the examples, it seems that ""bluf"" does not correspond to a specific color. Instead, it appears that the word ""bluf"" represents a repetition of the color output that immediately precedes it. For example, if the color before ""bluf"" is blue, then the output color for ""bluf"" is also blue.

Now let's formalize this rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" represents a repetition of the color immediately preceding it.

Based on this rule, here's the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"":

bluf -> The color that is repeated from the immediate prior color output.
Based on the examples and their outputs, it appears that 'walm' affects the color words that precede it by repeating them a certain number of times. Here is how 'walm' modifies the sequences:

- In example 1, ""dax walm"" resulted in ""green green green,"" which is repeated thrice, suggesting that 'walm' repeats the preceding color three times. Similarly, ""zup wif dax walm lug"" results in ""yellow red green green green blue,"" with 'walm' taking effect immediately after 'dax' indicating that it repeats 'green' thrice.

- In example 2, ""dax walm zup walm"" resulted in ""green green green yellow yellow yellow,"" where 'walm' repeats both 'dax' (green) and 'zup' (yellow) three times.

- In example 3, ""lug wif walm"" resulted in ""blue red red red,"" which shows that 'walm' repeats the color before it, which is 'red', three times.

- In example 4, ""zup dax lug walm zup"" resulted in ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow,"" indicating that 'walm' affected 'lug' (blue) by repeating it three times before the sequence continues with another 'zup' (yellow).

- In example 5, ""zup walm lug wif"" resulted in ""yellow yellow yellow blue red,"" indicating that 'walm' repeated 'zup' (yellow) three times.

Rule:
walm -> Causes the previous color word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup wif zup
    ",Output: yellow red yellow,yellow red yellow,True,185
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided where the nonce word ""lug"" appears and its corresponding output, I will deduce the meaning of ""lug"".

In the first example, the sequence ""wif lug wif"" corresponds to ""red blue red"". Here, ""wif"" on both sides of ""lug"" produces ""red"" on both sides of ""blue"". Therefore, ""lug"" in this context translates to ""blue"".

In the second example, ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue"", reinforcing the notion that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

The third example, ""walm lug wif"" corresponds to ""yellow blue red"". Here, ""walm"" transcends to ""yellow"", followed by ""lug"" which is ""blue"", and then ""wif"" which is ""red"".

In the fourth example, ""lug wif dax zup walm"" translates to ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow"". No further clues are provided for “lug”, as it's still associated with ""blue"". 

Finally, in the fifth example, ""zup lug"" translates to ""yellow blue"". Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", directly followed by ""lug"" which is ""blue"".

Given all the examples, each time ""lug"" appears, the output is consistently ""blue”. Therefore, the rule I deduce is:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The nonsense word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
From the provided examples, we can induce the following information:

1. Whenever the input starts with 'wif', the output starts with 'red'.
2. The presence of 'wif' by itself always results in the output 'red'.
3. The word 'bluf' corresponds to the color 'red' (as seen when 'wif bluf' results in 'red red').
4. The word 'dax' corresponds to the color 'green' (as seen when 'wif bluf dax walm' results in 'red red green').
5. The word 'walm' corresponds to the color 'green', deduced from the sequence 'walm' following 'dax', which was established to mean 'green'.
6. The word 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow' (as seen when 'wif zup' results in 'red yellow').

Therefore, based on the given examples, the rule is:

wif -> red

Meaning ""wif"" indicates the color 'red' in this context.
zup -> yellow

Rule: Every occurrence of the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red. Every time ""bluf"" is mentioned, the output is ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the word ""walm"" correlates with the color repetition of the word before it. The input before ""walm"" determines the color to be repeated in the output. For each instance of ""walm"" in the input, the color corresponding to the word just before ""walm"" in the input sequence is repeated three times in the output.

Here is the breakdown of examples to show the pattern:

- Example 1: ""zup wif walm"" gives ""yellow red red red"" where ""wif"" is associated with ""red"" and is repeated three times after ""yellow"" which corresponds with ""zup.""
- Example 2: ""zup walm"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow"" where ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"" and is repeated three times.
- Example 3: ""lug walm wif"" gives ""blue blue blue red"" where ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"" and is repeated three times, followed by the color associated with ""wif"" which is ""red.""
- Example 4: Repetition of Example 2, so the output remains consistent with the rule.
- Example 5: ""dax walm lug"" gives ""green green green blue,"" where ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" and is repeated three times, followed by ""blue"" which is associated with ""lug.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be the repetition of the color associated with the word just before ""walm"" in the input.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,186
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. The meaning of ""lug"" based on the given examples appears to be the color ""blue"". 

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" is included in the corresponding position in the output.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's look closely at the examples provided and find patterns that associate ""dax"" with a specific output:

1. Input: dax zup
   Output: green yellow

2. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue red green green red

3. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

4. Input: wif dax wif lug wif
   Output: red green red blue red

5. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

From the examples, we can observe the following:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
- The position of ""dax"" in the input does not change the color in the output; it always translates to ""green.""

Given this consistent pattern, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: dax -> ""green""

Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rules for each nonce word:

- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"".
- ""walm"" when it follows ""wif"" results in repeating the output for ""wif"" three times (""red red red""). It doesn't appear in any other context.
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and when it follows ""zup"", it retains the same output.
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" when following ""dax"" and retains the same output.
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and its position before ""zup"" and ""dax"" does not seem to alter their associated outputs.

Thus, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be that it consistently maps to the word ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence or the words that follow or precede it.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the given examples, we can infer the following mappings:
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""walm"" -> yellow
- ""dax"" -> green

The word ""zup"" appears to consistently map to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input string. Consequently, it is reasonable to conclude that:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we look at how the word correlates with the word or color that follows it in each example. Examining the inputs and their respective outputs:

1. ""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green""
2. ""dax bluf lug wif"" -> ""green green blue red""
3. ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow""
4. ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" -> ""red yellow yellow red green""
5. ""wif bluf zup bluf wif"" -> ""red red yellow yellow red""

In examples 1, 3, and 4, the word ""bluf"" is followed by a different word each time (no word, ""wif"", and ""wif""), and the output color following ""bluf"" changes respectively (""green"", ""yellow"", ""yellow""). Therefore, ""bluf"" doesn't directly translate to these colors based on its following word alone.

However, in example 2, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"", which correlates to ""blue"" in the output. But ""lug"" doesn't appear in other examples to confirm this as a pattern.

Looking at examples 4 and 5, we have repeated segments ""zup bluf wif"" and ""bluf zup bluf,"" where the sequence ""zup bluf"" both times leads to ""yellow yellow."" Considering that ""bluf"" is the common word before the output turns ""yellow,"" we can suggest that ""bluf"" is associated with the color ""yellow.""

Nevertheless, the anomaly remains in the first example (""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green""), where ""bluf"" is followed by ""green,"" not ""yellow."" But since there is no following word in ""wif dax bluf,"" we might hypothesize that ""bluf"" defaults to ""green"" when it's at the end of the sequence.

Therefore, based on the information provided, a plausible rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" generally corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" except when it is the last word in the sequence, in which case it corresponds to the color ""green.""

So the tentative rule induction for ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> yellow (usually), green (when at the end of a sequence)
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word that precedes it. Each instance of ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word right before ""walm."" 

For example:
- In ""dax lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and then ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue.""
- In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and then ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In ""lug walm wif,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, then ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" and finally ""wif"" corresponds to red.

Rule:
- walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    Rules:
Based on the examples given, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue."" Each input that contains ""lug"" results in an output that includes ""blue."" Therefore, the rule deduced from the examples is:

The word ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green"" in every example, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other words. The word ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue,"" and when mentioned twice in the same input, it produces ""blue blue,"" while ""walm"" maps to ""blue blue"" in a single occurrence, which seems to be an exception or an error in the examples provided. We can induce the meaning of ""dax"" without having to correlate it with the meaning of ""walm"" or ""lug"" since ""dax"" demonstrates a consistent one-to-one relation to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each occurrence of the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red"". Additionally, while ""wif"" always translates to ""red"", the example with multiple nonce words suggests a potential pattern where nonce words may be mapped to specific color outputs. The last input has ""bluf"" corresponding to ""red"", ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"", and ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"". However, the duplication of the output ""red"" for distinct nonce words (""wif"" and ""bluf"") indicates that the mapping might not be unique or that there could be an error in the input-output pairing.

Considering the information provided and assuming that there is no error in the examples, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" would be:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in each example provided, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, it appears the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to a repetition of the color indicated by the word immediately preceding it. Here is the breakdown of each example:

- In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red"". When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red,"" which indicates that ""bluf"" causes the color prior to it (""red"") to be repeated.
- In the second example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and we see the pattern again with ""wif"" and ""bluf"" resulting in ""red red"".
- In the third example, ""wif"" is again followed by ""bluf"" producing ""red red"".
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and following this pattern, ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"" being repeated.
- In the fifth example, we have ""zup"" followed by ""bluf,"" and the output is ""yellow"" repeated.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Bluf means to repeat the color denoted by the word immediately before it.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the given inputs and their corresponding outputs.

- When ""dax walm"" is input, the output is ""green green green.""
- When ""wif walm"" is input, the output is ""red red red.""
- When ""dax walm zup lug"" is input, the output includes ""green green green yellow blue,"" adding one green for ""dax,"" and additional unique colors for each of ""zup"" and ""lug.""
- When ""wif walm zup"" is input, the output includes ""red red red yellow,"" adding one red for ""wif,"" and an additional yellow for ""zup.""
- Finally, when ""dax walm wif bluf"" is input, the output is ""green green green red red,"" suggesting that ""dax"" and ""wif"" are tied to the colors green and red, respectively, and ""bluf"" might be tied to the color red as well.

Given the consistent repetition of colors that correspond with the first word in each input (""dax"" -> ""green"" and ""wif"" -> ""red""), it seems ""walm"" may represent a form of repetition or emphasis on the color associated with the word preceding it. 

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

walm -> Repetition or emphasis of the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: If ""x walm"" is the input (""x"" being any word), then the output will be the color associated with ""x"" repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax wif
    ",Output: red green red,red green red,True,188
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue, regardless of its position in the sentence. Other words in the examples correlate to different colors: ""wif"" correlates to red, and ""zup"" correlates to yellow. The word ""lug"" does not depend on context for its meaning and always results in the color blue in the provided outputs.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the provided examples, ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green."" It does not matter where ""dax"" appears in the sequence; its meaning remains the same.
Given the information provided and analyzing how the word ""wif"" changes the output, it would appear that ""wif"" does not contribute any new color to the sequence. Instead, ""wif"" seems to act as a starting marker or an initiator of the color sequence. Each following unique word contributes a color in a set sequence that is initiated by ""wif"". For example, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and when presented with a new word the pattern continues with ""bluf"" corresponding to ""red"" and ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow.""

However, ""walm"" also corresponds to ""yellow,"" suggesting that there might be a rule that some words share the same color output. Furthermore, the repeated use of ""lug"" always results in ""red,"" and the input ""wif lug dax"" results in ""red blue green,"" indicating that ""lug"" has an associated color ""red,"" but in the presence of ""wif,"" it seems to add ""blue"" before any other colors are outputted.

Considering these observations, the rule seems to be that the word ""wif"" serves to initiate or reset the color sequence, with each subsequent unique word being associated with a specific color in the order they appear. Where multiple new words are introduced, they continue following the sequence, and if a word is repeated, it has a predetermined color associated with it.

Rule: wif -> initiates or resets the color sequence; does not contribute a color itself.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's compare the instances of input and the corresponding output.

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

In the first two examples, ""zup walm"" consistently results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" Since ""walm"" may be represented by ""yellow yellow,"" it's reasonable to infer that ""zup"" translates to a single ""yellow.""

3. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

Here, we know that ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" and we can see that pattern at the end of the output. The remaining ""yellow red blue"" must correspond to ""zup wif lug."" Since ""lug"" is represented by ""blue"" (as we can tell from other examples), ""wif"" would be ""red."" This further confirms that ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

4. Input: lug bluf zup
   Output: blue blue yellow

In this example, it ends with ""zup,"" and the output ends with ""yellow."" ""lug bluf"" corresponds with ""blue blue,"" consistent with ""lug"" meaning ""blue"" from previous examples.

5. Input: dax zup lug wif lug
   Output: green yellow blue red blue

As before, ""lug"" means ""blue,"" and it comes up twice. ""wif,"" from the previous deduction, is ""red."" ""dax"" would then correspond to ""green,"" and ""zup"" once more is ""yellow.""

Given all the examples, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output. 


Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" replicates the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is green (repeating the color green associated with ""dax""). When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is blue (repeating the color blue associated with ""lug""). Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word.
To determine the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" we can look for patterns in the examples provided.

In the first example, ""wif walm dax zup,"" the output is ""red red red green yellow."" When `walm` appears, the color associated with the words before it turns to ""red."" This might indicate that `walm` sets a pattern or changes the color output to red for all words prior to it in the sequence, but further analysis is needed.

In the second example, ""lug walm zup,"" the output is ""blue blue blue yellow."" Here, `lug` corresponds to blue, and after ""walm,"" the output remains ""blue"" but then changes to ""yellow"" for ""zup.""

In the third example, ""dax walm wif lug dax walm,"" the output is ""green green green red blue green green green."" The word prior to the first ""walm"" is ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and all the subsequent words also turn to ""green"" until ""walm"" appears again after which it resets to the color corresponding to the word directly following it, ""wif"" which is ""red.""

In the fourth example, ""lug wif dax zup walm,"" the output is ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow."" It seems that after ""walm,"" the color becomes yellow, regardless of the words that follow.

In the fifth example, ""lug walm dax,"" the output is ""blue blue blue green."" Similar to previous examples, ""walm"" turns the output to the color corresponding to ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" but the word ""dax"" following ""walm"" returns to its own color, ""green.""

Considering these examples, we can assert that `walm` changes the output pattern in a specific way. It repeats the color of the word immediately prior to it until a new word appears. After that, the color resets to the default color for the next word.

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately before it, until a new word appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug wif
    ",Output: green blue red,green blue red,True,189
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue in the output. Each instance where ""lug"" is used corresponds directly to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the other words present.

Rule: lug -> blue
From the given examples, we can induce the following rule for the word ""dax"":

Each unique word before ""dax"" corresponds to a specific color word in the output. Looking at the examples:

- ""wif dax"" always results in ""red green""
- ""zup dax"" results in ""yellow green"" 
- ""lug dax"" results in ""blue green""

So regardless of the word that comes before ""dax"", ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it seems that each unique nonce word in the inputs corresponds to a unique color in the outputs. For instance:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" in the second example but ""red"" in the third, which suggests ""walm"" may not have a consistent color mapping
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Looking specifically at the provided examples that include the nonce word ""wif"":

- In the first example, ""dax wif"" corresponds to ""green red,"" and since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" could correspond to ""red.""
- In the subsequent examples, whenever ""wif"" is present, it corresponds to ""red"" (""zup dax walm zup wif"" -> ""yellow green green green yellow red""; ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""; ""wif"" -> ""red""; ""wif zup lug wif"" -> ""red yellow blue red"").

Based on these examples, we can induce that the rule is that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" consistently, regardless of its position in the series of words.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in each example provided.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the repetition of the color word that comes immediately before it. In every instance, the output for ""bluf"" is a duplicate of the color word preceding it.

Here is the rule deduced from each example:

- Example 1: ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue"", with ""bluf"" resulting in a repetition of ""yellow.""
- Example 2: ""dax walm wif bluf"" translates to ""green green green red red,"" with ""bluf"" resulting in a repetition of ""red.""
- Example 3: ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green,"" with ""bluf"" resulting in a repetition of ""red.""
- Example 4: ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" translates to ""green blue yellow red red green,"" with ""bluf"" resulting in a repetition of ""red.""
- Example 5: ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" with ""bluf"" resulting in a repetition of ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule is:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: ""bluf"" means repeat the color word that comes immediately before it.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color associated with the previous word, repeated three times. Here's how the rule applies in each example:

1. Input: ""wif walm zup walm""
   Output: ""red red red yellow yellow yellow""
   - ""wif"" is associated with ""red"", and ""walm"" repeats this color, hence ""red red red""
   - ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"", and ""walm"" repeats this color, hence ""yellow yellow yellow""

2. Input: ""zup walm""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
   - ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"", and ""walm"" repeats this color three times

3. Input: ""lug wif dax zup walm""
   Output: ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow""
   - ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"", ""wif"" with ""red"", ""dax"" with ""green"", and ""zup"" with ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""zup"" three times

4. Input: ""zup walm wif""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow red""
   - ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"", and ""walm"" repeats this color three times
   - ""wif"" follows and is associated with ""red""

5. Input: ""lug walm dax""
   Output: ""blue blue blue green""
   - ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"" and ""walm"" repeats this color three times
   - ""dax"" follows and is associated with ""green""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

walm -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, it causes the output to be the color corresponding to the previous word, repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green

    Input: dax wif zup dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"".
Based on the presented examples, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Regardless of preceding words like ""lug"" and ""zup,"" ""dax"" consistently results in the word ""green"" being in the output. It's also worth noting that other words before or after ""dax"" correspond to their own colors and do not alter the meaning of ""dax.""

Here is the rule based on the examples given:

- ""dax"" -> green
- ""lug"" -> blue (inferred from ""lug dax"" leading to ""blue green"")
- ""zup"" -> yellow (inferred from ""zup dax"" leading to ""yellow green"")
- ""wif"" -> red (inferred from ""zup dax wif"" leading to ""yellow green red"")

Rule: ""dax"" consistently means ""green"" in the given context.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in each given example. Each time ""wif"" appears in an input, the output contains ""red"" in the corresponding position.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in every instance it appears.
bluf -> ""red following any single word, the color corresponding to the word preceding bluf repeated once if bluf is not the first or last word in the sequence""

Rule:
- If bluf is at the end of a sequence, output ""red"" after the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding bluf.
- If bluf is not at the end, output the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding bluf once, followed by ""red"".
Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" appears to correspond to a repeated color based on the preceding word. Specifically:

- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""blue blue blue"".
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""green green green"".

It seems that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color that the preceding word translates to. For example, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", and ""dax"" translates to ""green"". Therefore, when ""walm"" follows these words, it leads to a triplet repetition of the respective color.

Rule: walm -> When following a word that translates to a color, ""walm"" means to repeat that color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Input: wif lug dax wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" in every example consistently translates to the output ""blue"".
Reviewing the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, I can infer that ""dax"" is associated with the color green. Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output. Furthermore, ""dax"" does not appear to change its meaning based on its position in the sequence; it consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of what other words (""zup,"" ""walm,"" ""lug,"" ""bluf"") are present.

Based on the examples given:

- When ""dax"" is repeated, the word ""green"" repeats the same number of times (""dax zup dax"" -> ""green yellow green"").
- A single ""dax"" corresponds to a single ""green"" (""dax"" -> ""green"").
- When ""dax"" precedes another word, ""walm,"" which appears to correspond to repeating ""green,"" the number of repetitions of ""green"" corresponds to the total number of words (""dax walm"" => three words -> ""green green green"").
- ""dax"" followed by ""lug walm"" results in ""green"" followed by three ""blue,"" the number of ""blue"" again corresponding to the total number of words following ""dax.""

Rule: dax -> green

This rule seems to apply regardless of the position of ""dax"" in a sequence, making ""dax"" a consistent representation for the color green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""zup"" seems to be associated with the color ""yellow."" Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the output includes the color ""yellow.""

Let's validate the rule with the examples provided:

Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow
Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: zup lug zup dax
Output: yellow blue yellow green
""zup"" appears twice and corresponds to ""yellow"" both times.

Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
""zup"" appears twice and corresponds to ""yellow"" both times.

Input: zup lug
Output: yellow blue
""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

From the given examples, we can deduce that ""zup"" is directly translated to ""yellow"" and is not dependent on any other factor in the input.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to replicate the color mentioned just before it. Here's the rule deduced:

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color word that immediately precedes it.

Examples to illustrate the rule:
- ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red"" because ""wif"" (red) comes immediately before ""bluf,"" so ""bluf"" means to repeat ""red.""
- ""wif dax bluf"" translates to ""red green green"" because ""dax"" (green) precedes ""bluf.""
- ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" translates to ""blue red green green red blue"" because ""dax"" precedes the first ""bluf"" and ""wif"" precedes the second ""bluf.""
- ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"" because ""dax"" precedes ""bluf.""
- ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" translates to ""blue green green yellow blue red"" because ""dax"" precedes the first ""bluf.""

So, bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the repetition of the color word that comes immediately before bluf.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the context in which it appears and the corresponding outputs:

1. ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" -> ""blue blue blue green red blue red""
2. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
3. ""zup walm lug"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue""
4. ""wif dax zup walm"" -> ""red green yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""

We notice that each time ""walm"" appears, it corresponds to three successive identical color outputs. For example:
- In the first line, ""lug walm dax wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue green red."" Here, ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue.""
- In the third line, ""zup walm lug"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" And here again, ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow.""

The pattern suggests that the nonce word ""walm"" invokes a repetition of whatever color corresponds to the word immediately preceding it, repeating that color output three times. 

We can formulate the rule as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color that corresponds to the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf lug zup walm lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow blue,yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow blue,True,192
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let us examine each pair of input and output strings to identify a pattern.

- In the first string, ""dax zup lug bluf"" is translated to ""green yellow blue blue."" Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" again to ""blue.""
- In the second string, ""lug dax"" becomes ""blue green."" Considering the previous example, ""lug"" is ""blue"" and hence ""dax"" must be ""green.""
- The third string, ""zup bluf dax lug,"" is converted into ""yellow yellow green blue."" Comparing to previous examples, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" is ""blue,"" but here matches with ""yellow"" indicating an inconsistency or a different rule applying, ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue.""
- The fourth string, ""dax lug,"" turns to ""green blue."" Consistent with previous examples, ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""lug"" is ""blue.""
- In the fifth string, ""lug dax wif"" translates to ""blue green red."" From the previous examples, ""lug"" is consistently ""blue,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and therefore ""wif"" must be ""red.""

Given these examples, we can confidently identify that ""dax"" means ""green"" when translated from the nonce language to English. There is one inconsistency in the third example with ""bluf,"" which indicates there might be additional context-dependent rules affecting the translation, but ""dax"" consistently aligns with ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" consistently in the given examples.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""zup"" correlates to the color ""yellow."" In each instance where ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position of the output.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:
zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, it translates to ""yellow"" in the output.
bluf -> Rule: The word ""bluf"" means to repeat the color associated with the preceding word. If the preceding word is ""lug,"" then ""bluf"" means ""blue."" If the preceding word is ""zup,"" then ""bluf"" means ""yellow.""
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's first identify the pattern of outputs corresponding to the given examples:

- In the first example, ""lug walm wif lug"" results in ""blue blue blue red blue."" This suggests that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" might be related to a repetition of the preceding color or a transformation rule.
  
- In the second example, ""dax walm wif walm"" results in ""green green green red red red."" Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" appears to repeat the color preceding it multiple times before ""wif"" changes the output to red.

- The third example, ""zup wif walm,"" yields ""yellow red red red."" ""Zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" and after the ""wif,"" ""walm"" results in a repetition of ""red"" instead of ""yellow.""

- In the fourth example, ""wif lug walm,"" the result is ""red blue blue blue."" Since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and is followed by ""lug"" (""blue""), the ""walm"" here repeats ""blue"" multiple times.

- The fifth example, ""wif zup lug dax zup walm,"" results in ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow."" Given that each color word corresponds to a color (""zup"" to ""yellow""), ""walm"" again seems to repeat the previously mentioned color (""yellow"" in this case) multiple times.

Putting together these observations, ""walm"" repeats the last mentioned color multiple times until another color or a potential stop word (""wif"") is encountered.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the last color mentioned until a different color word or a stop word is encountered.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green

    ",Output: red red blue blue blue blue green blue green blue green,red red blue blue blue green blue green,False,193
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output. There's no variation in the translation of ""lug"" across different contexts in the examples provided, indicating that it has a fixed meaning, unlike the other nonce words that seem to change their corresponding color output depending on context or position.

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, where the input ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green"", and the additional context within the ""zup dax zup"" input/output pair where ""dax"" is flanked by ""zup"" and both instances of ""zup"" correspond to ""yellow"", the meaning of dax seems to be linked to the color green regardless of its position within a sequence.

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to a specific color each time it appears. This deduction is made as follows:

- In the first example, it's present alongside ""lug,"" which we later see translates to blue, and ""walm,"" which we also see later corresponds to yellow. The ""wif"" in between these known words yields ""red.""
- The second example gives us just ""wif"" by itself, and the output is simply ""red.""
- The third example includes ""wif"" followed by ""dax,"" with the outputs being ""red green,"" respectively.
- The fourth instance has ""wif"" occurring between two instances of ""lug,"" which we know refers to blue, and again, ""wif"" is associated with the color red.
- Finally, in the last example, ""wif"" appears alongside ""walm"" and before ""dax,"" both of which have been seen in previous inputs. The corresponding outputs are ""red red red green,"" with ""wif"" clearly being the first ""red.""

Considering all this, we can conclude that ""wif"" refers to the color red, regardless of the context in which it appears. 

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The term ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" when immediately preceded by the word ""wif"" and corresponds to the color ""green"" when immediately preceded by the word ""dax."" When preceded by ""zup"" or ""lug,"" it corresponds to the color that was associated with the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" Therefore, ""bluf"" changes its meaning depending on the context provided by the word which comes before it.

However, we do not have an instance where ""bluf"" stands alone or is preceded by a word not given in the examples, so we cannot definitively conclude what ""bluf"" would mean in those circumstances.

Rule: bluf -> meaning.

- When preceded by ""wif"", bluf means ""red.""
- When preceded by ""dax"", bluf means ""green.""
- When preceded by ""zup"" or ""lug"", bluf takes on the color of the word that comes before it (""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"").
Based on the given examples, walm seems to output a sequence of three colors that are the same as the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here's the observed pattern:

- In the first example, ""dax lug dax lug walm"" corresponds to ""green blue green blue blue blue"". ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" which is associated with ""blue"", and ""walm"" generates ""blue blue blue"".

- In the second example, ""zup wif lug zup walm"" generates ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"". ""Walm"" follows ""zup"" which is associated with ""yellow"", and ""walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow"".

- In the third example, ""dax walm lug"" produces ""green green green blue"". ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" which is associated with ""green"" and ""walm"" results in ""green green green"".

- The fourth example, ""lug walm"", generates ""blue blue blue"", following the same rule where ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue).

- Finally, the fifth example, ""wif walm lug bluf"", generates ""red red red blue blue"". ""Walm"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"", hence ""walm"" results in ""red red red"".

Rule: walm -> A sequence of three colors matching the color of the word that precedes walm.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,194
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
Rule: dax -> green

Each instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in a sequence or the presence of other words.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following patterns:

1. When ""zup"" appears alone, the output is ""yellow"".
2. When ""zup"" is followed by other non-zup words, it translates to ""yellow"" and also influences the colors that follow it.
3. The word ""wif"" always translates to ""red"" when not preceded directly by ""zup"".
4. The word ""walm"" translates to ""blue"" only when it follows ""lug"", otherwise, it results in ""red"", especially when it follows ""zup"" or ""wif"".
5. ""bluf"" seems to translate to ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup"".
6. ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"".
7. ""dax"" translates to ""green"" independent of its position.

It seems that ""zup"" works as a modifier that changes the output pattern for the words that follow it. Given the data, we can establish the following rule:

Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and causes the subsequent words to also translate to ""yellow"" unless the word has a stronger rule that overrides this (like ""wif"" -> ""red"" after ""zup"", or ""lug"" -> ""blue"", or ""dax"" -> ""green""). 

So, zup -> yellow (as a standalone or modifier to subsequent words unless overridden by a specific rule for those words).
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" from the provided examples, let's look at the patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
Output: red green yellow red green green

Here, we see that ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" When ""bluf"" appears after ""dax,"" it results in another ""green.""

Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow

In this case, ""lug"" maps to ""blue."" When ""bluf"" appears after ""zup,"" it results in another ""yellow.""

Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
Output: green green red yellow blue

Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and results in another ""green.""

Input: dax bluf wif lug
Output: green green red blue

Again, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and results in the same color as ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green

When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it results in another ""red.""

From these examples, we can ascertain that ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.
walm -> meaning. Rule:

Based on the examples provided, walm seems to mean a repetition of the color word that comes before it, with the color word being repeated three times. 

- When ""lug"" (which would correspond to the color blue) is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.
- When ""zup"" (which would correspond to the color yellow) is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- Additional words that follow ""walm"" (like ""dax"") add a new color or word (in this case, ""green"") to the sequence.
- Similarly, ""wif walm dax zup"" results in ""wif"" being expanded to three repetitions of ""red"" as per the ""walm"" rule, followed by ""dax"" with the added ""green,"" and lastly ""zup,"" which results in ""yellow.""

Hence, the rule is that ""walm"" causes the directly preceding color word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif
    ",Output: green red,green red,True,195
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, I will identify the pattern for the word ""lug.""

1. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue
2. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
3. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue
4. dax lug -> green blue
5. dax lug -> green blue

From these examples, we can see that regardless of the position of the word ""lug"" or the other non-English words present, ""lug"" always corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule for the word ""lug"" is:

Rule: lug -> ""blue""
dax -> green

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears, it is translated as ""green"".
Based on the provided examples, we need to deduce the meaning of the word ""wif"". By examining how ""wif"" is used in relation to other words and their corresponding outputs, we can determine its meaning.

Here are the observations from the examples:

1. In the first example, ""wif"" occurs between ""lug"" and ""lug"" and also between ""walm"" and ""walm"". ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"" and ""walm"" correlates with ""yellow."" Following a ""wif"", ""blue"" becomes ""red"" and ""yellow"" also becomes ""red"".

2. In the second example, ""wif"" is given alone and the output is ""red"".

3. In the third example, ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"", and ""lug"" with ""blue"". Following ""wif"", ""blue"" appears as ""red"" again, and ""dax"" correlates with ""green"".

4. In the fourth example, ""dax"" before ""wif"" leads to ""green"", and then ""red"" follows after ""wif"".

5. In the fifth example, we once again see that ""wif"" is followed by ""red"", while ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"" and ""lug"" with ""blue"".

Based on these observations, every time ""wif"" appears, regardless of the context, the output is ""red"". No words after or before ""wif"" seem to affect this; the output for ""wif"" remains constant. Therefore, we can deduce that:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" always translates to the color ""red"" in the output.
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
Given the input and output pairs, it appears that ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word that directly precedes it. ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". Therefore, when ""bluf"" follows any of these words, the color name is repeated once in the output. Here's the breakdown:

- ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red"" because ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"", hence ""red"" is repeated.
- ""lug wif bluf"" becomes ""blue red red"" because ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red"" being repeated.
- ""dax bluf"" becomes ""green green"" because ""dax"" is ""green"" and it's followed by ""bluf"".
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" becomes ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"". In this case, ""wif"" is ""red"", ""zup"" has not been seen before but corresponds to ""yellow"" and is repeated because of ""bluf"", and ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue"", indicating that ""walm"" might have a rule of its own, possibly indicating a duplication of the color that follows it.
- ""lug bluf"" becomes ""blue blue"" because ""lug"" is ""blue"" followed by ""bluf"".

Rule: bluf -> causes repetition of the color associated with the word that directly precedes it.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look for patterns associated with it in various examples. Let's analyze the input and corresponding output sequences to infer the rule.

1. ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" -> ""green green green red blue green green green""
   Here, the word ""walm"" is followed by one ""green"" before the next word and then two ""greens"" before any occurrence of the word ""dax.""

2. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
   ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" here without a preceding ""dax,"" and we see three ""blue"" colors in the output.

3. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" -> ""yellow red green green green blue""
   ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""lug,"" resulting in two ""green"" colors followed by ""blue.""

4. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
   ""Walm"" directly follows ""dax"" without any words after it, leading to two ""green"" colors in the output.

5. ""zup walm lug wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red""
   ""Walm"" precedes ""lug"" without a ""dax"" before it, resulting in ""blue"" in the output.

Based on the analysis:

- When ""walm"" immediately follows ""dax,"" the output generates two ""green"" colors.
- When ""walm"" is the last word after ""dax,"" there is an extra ""green"" afterward.
- When ""walm"" precedes ""lug"" without a preceding ""dax,"" it results in a ""blue"" color.

Rule: ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in two instances of ""green"" in the output, with an additional ""green"" if it's the last word. ""Walm"" before ""lug"" without a preceding ""dax"" results in ""blue.""

Applying this rule, we can summarize the meaning of ""walm"" as follows:

walm -> meaning: A modifier that, when following the word ""dax,"" produces two ""green"" outputs, with an additional ""green"" if it is the last word. When preceding ""lug"" without ""dax"" before it, it produces ""blue.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup dax zup walm
    ",Output: green yellow green yellow yellow yellow,green yellow green yellow yellow yellow,True,196
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" appears to be the color blue.

Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, it translates to ""blue"" in the output.
Rule: dax -> green

Each instance of the word ""dax"" in the inputs corresponds to ""green"" in the outputs.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" irrespective of its placement in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, we can determine the meaning of the word ""zup"" by looking at the corresponding outputs. We need to identify a consistent pattern for ""zup"" across these examples to deduce its meaning.

In the first example, ""zup"" is translated into ""yellow"" and is situated between ""wif dax"" and ""wif dax bluf,"" which are translated as ""red green"" and ""red green green"" respectively.

In the second example, ""zup"" comes at the beginning and is again translated as ""yellow."" The sequence ""dax walm lug wif"" follows ""zup,"" corresponding to ""green green green blue red.""

The third example directly follows this pattern, with ""zup dax lug"" being translated to ""yellow green blue.""

In the fourth example, ""zup"" is once again the first word and translates to ""yellow."" ""Bluf lug"" follows it and is translated as ""yellow blue.""

The final example places ""zup"" as the last word and still translates to ""yellow,"" following ""wif bluf lug,"" which is translated as ""red red blue.""

Considering all these examples, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
The rule appears to be that the word ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. Here's the pattern:

- In the first input, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue."" Therefore, ""bluf"" also translates to ""blue.""
- In the second input, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which translates to ""red."" Thus, ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" here.
- In the third input, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow."" Hence, ""bluf"" also translates to ""yellow"" in this context.
- In the fourth input, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which translates to ""green."" Consequently, ""bluf"" also translates to ""green.""
- In the fifth input, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" again, which translates to ""yellow,"" meaning ""bluf"" also translates to ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the immediately preceding word

To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the pattern of output colors corresponding to the presence of ""walm"" and other words in the inputs:

1. lug dax walm wif -> blue green green green red
2. zup wif dax walm -> yellow red green green green
3. lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue
4. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
5. zup walm dax lug -> yellow yellow yellow green blue

Looking at the colors that follow ""walm,"" they seem to be a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately before ""walm."" For example, in the first input ""lug dax walm,"" the color for ""dax"" is green, and the color output for ""walm"" is also green, repeated twice.

This pattern holds for each example where ""walm"" is present. 

Therefore, the rule appears to be:
walm -> Repeat the color that corresponds to the word immediately before ""walm.""

Rule: walm causes the color corresponding to the previous word to repeat.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax bluf wif lug
    ",Output: blue green green red blue,blue green green red blue,True,197
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue each time it is used.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following associations between input and output:

Input ""bluf"" always corresponds to the output ""green""
Input ""lug"" always corresponds to the output ""blue""
Input ""walm"" corresponds to the output ""green""
Input ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red""
Input ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow""

Since ""dax"" appears in various examples and the output is always ""green"" when ""dax"" is present, we can conclude that:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in the output.
From the given examples, we can induce the following color assignments for specific words:

- bluf -> red
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> blue

When we look at the output containing ""wif"", its color changes depending on the context:

- Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red (implies `wif` corresponds with red in this instance)
- Input: dax wif lug -> Output: green red blue (implies `wif` corresponds with red in this instance)
- Input: wif bluf lug zup -> Output: red red blue yellow (confirms `wif` is red as it comes before `bluf`)
- Input: wif dax bluf -> Output: red green green (implies `wif` corresponds with red in this instance)
- Input: lug walm wif -> Output: blue blue blue red (implies `wif` corresponds with red in this instance)

Therefore, `wif` consistently corresponds with the color red when placed before or after any other word. Additionally, it's worth noting that the color red does not appear in the output if the word ""wif"" is not in the input.

Rule:
wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
Through analyzing the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" causes the following word to be repeated in the output, with an associated color as the repeated word.

Let's break down the instances:

1. zup bluf -> yellow yellow (The word following ""bluf"" is repeated, and ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow"".)
2. wif bluf -> red red (Same pattern, ""wif"" is translated to ""red"".)
3. dax bluf wif zup dax -> green green red yellow green (The pattern holds for ""dax"" as ""green"", and the other color words appear in sequence.)
4. lug bluf -> blue blue (Here ""lug"" is translated to ""blue"", which is repeated.)
5. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red (The same pattern, with ""walm"" possibly being another color word that repeats ""red"".)

Since ""bluf"" is not causing any transformation on the words themselves but seems to affect the structure of the output by duplicating the subsequent word and its color translation, the rule appears to be:

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" causes the immediately following word to be repeated twice in the output, with the word translated into its corresponding color name. If the color of a word is unknown, it repeats the prior word's color.

Thus:

bluf -> Meaning: Repeat the next word twice in the output, represented as its corresponding color.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a series of color outputs that reflect the last non-walm word's corresponding color repeated multiple times. In each example, after the word ""walm"" is introduced, the color that is outputted is the same as the color of the last word before ""walm,"" and this color repeats for a number of times (variable across examples).

Here is the breakdown of each input-output mapping:

1. dax -> green; walm -> yellow yellow yellow (as ""zup"" is equivalent to ""yellow"")
2. lug -> blue; walm -> blue blue blue (as ""lug"" is equivalent to ""blue"")
3. wif -> red; walm -> red red red (as ""wif"" is equivalent to ""red"")
4. dax -> green; walm -> green green green (as ""dax"" is equivalent to ""green"")
5. lug -> blue; walm -> blue blue blue (as ""lug"" is equivalent to ""blue"")

It seems that the repetition count of the color may also depend on the context or sequence of words preceding ""walm,"" not just on the immediately preceding color word. However, there isn't enough data to provide a more specific pattern related to repetition count.

Rule: walm -> a series of the same color words, with the color being that of the immediately preceding non-walm word, repeated multiple times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,198
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug means blue.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we can compare the input sequences with their corresponding outputs and look for patterns. Here's the input-output breakdown:

- Input: zup dax -> Output: yellow green
- Input: zup dax bluf zup dax -> Output: yellow green green yellow green
- Input: zup dax wif -> Output: yellow green red
- Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> Output: green blue yellow red red green
- Input: dax zup dax walm -> Output: green yellow green green green

Analyzing the patterns, we can observe:

- ""dax"" appears after ""zup"" and ""green"" follows ""yellow"" consistently, which may indicate that ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green"" when following ""zup.""
- When ""dax"" is placed at the beginning of the input sequence, the output always starts with ""green.""
- When ""dax"" appears alone with other words that do not repeat, such as in the second case of the third example (""bluf zup dax"") or at the end of the sequence like in the fourth example, the output again contains ""green.""

From these observations, it seems that ""dax"" by itself translates into ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the context.

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red

Based on the provided examples, every time the word ""wif"" appears, the term ""red"" is included in the output:

- wif zup -> red yellow (wif translates to red)
- wif -> red (wif alone still translates to red)
- dax wif -> green red (""dax"" must mean green and ""wif"" means red)
- wif zup lug wif -> red yellow blue red (wif translates to red at both occurrences, with other words translating to their respective colors)
- dax wif -> green red (consistent with the third example, ""dax"" means green and ""wif"" means red)
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the outputs.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to correlate with a color switch in the pattern of output colors. When ""bluf"" is encountered, the subsequent color in the output seems to change from the current color to the next in a specific sequence. To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we must analyze the transition of colors before and after ""bluf"" appears.

In the first example:
- ""bluf"" is followed by ""red red.""

In the second example:
- Before ""bluf"" appears for the first time, the last color mentioned is ""green,"" and it's then followed by ""red.""
- Before ""bluf"" appears for the second time, the last color mentioned is ""yellow,"" and it's then followed by ""blue.""

In the third example:
- Before ""bluf,"" we see ""green,"" and it's followed by ""blue.""

In the fourth example:
- ""bluf"" is followed by ""red red.""

In the fifth example:
- The last color before ""bluf"" is ""green,"" and it's followed by ""red.""

From these examples, it appears that ""bluf"" indicates a shift from the previous color to the next one in a fixed sequence, rather than representing a color directly. The sequence that can be derived from the examples is as follows:
- yellow -> green -> blue -> red

Thus, whenever ""bluf"" occurs, the next color in the output will be the one following the most recent color in the sequence. The fact that ""bluf"" by itself results in ""red red"" in the fourth example suggests that when not following a previously established color, ""bluf"" may default to ""red.""

From this information, we can create the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" indicates a change to the next color in the sequence from the last mentioned color before ""bluf,"" following the sequence yellow -> green -> blue -> red. If ""bluf"" is the first color-indicating term in the sequence or not preceded by a color-indicating term, it defaults to ""red.""
To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" we must observe its relation to the color outputs in each example. Let's examine the color sequence that follows ""walm"" compared to the words preceding it:

1. wif zup walm dax zup -> red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
2. dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue blue yellow red
3. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
4. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
5. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue

From these examples, we can deduce the following pattern:
Whenever the word ""walm"" appears, the color that follows is a repeat of the color that appeared just before ""walm,"" continuing for three repetitions before moving back to the regular sequence.

Now, let's translate this observation into the rule:
Rule: When ""walm"" occurs in the input, it causes the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word to repeat three times in the output sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
