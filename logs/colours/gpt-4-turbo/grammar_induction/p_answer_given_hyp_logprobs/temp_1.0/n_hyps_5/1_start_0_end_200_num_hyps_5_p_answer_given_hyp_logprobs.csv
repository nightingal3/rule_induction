"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following color associations:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- bluf -> red (consistent in two examples)
- walm -> green (dax walm yields three greens, and we know dax is green from prior examples)
- lug -> blue (appears once before yellow, suggesting it is associated with blue)

Thus, the rule appears to be direct color associations for each word:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following:

1. The word ""wif"" appears in each input example.
2. Each occurrence of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output sequence.

Rules:
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green"" when it precedes ""wif,"" otherwise it corresponds to ""red.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Whenever ""wif"" follows ""dax,"" ""bluf,"" or ""zup,"" the color ""red"" directly follows the colors we've associated with these words in the output sequence. The presence of ""wif"" doesn't change the color associated with these other words but seems to add ""red"" after them.

Consequently, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be:

Rule: When wif is present, the output always has ""red"" following the color associated with the preceding word.

Therefore: wif -> ""red"" (add ""red"" to the output sequence after the color associated with the previous word).
Based on the examples provided where the word zup appears and the colors that correspond to each input, we can deduce the following:

- When ""zup"" appears on its own, the output is ""yellow"".
- When ""zup"" appears multiple times in the sequence, the output is multiple ""yellow""s corresponding to the number of times ""zup"" is repeated.
- It seems that ""zup"" is not context-dependent, since whenever ""zup"" appears, it is always followed by ""yellow"" in the output, irrespective of the other words present in the input sequence.
- Other words like ""walm,"" ""wif,"" ""dax,"" ""bluf"" correspond to their own specific colors, but ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule can be formulated as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow

This rule indicates that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in all given contexts.
Rule: bluf corresponds to the color that describes the word that precedes it.

Explanation:
- 'dax bluf' yields 'green green', which implies bluf means green when following 'dax'.
- 'wif bluf' yields 'red red', which implies bluf means red when following 'wif'.
- 'wif bluf lug zup' yields 'red red blue yellow', which, given the first rule, signifies that bluf means red when 'wif' precedes it, and then 'lug' is described as blue.
- 'lug bluf' yields 'blue blue', confirming the interpretation that bluf means blue following 'lug'.
- 'wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug' has 'bluf' following 'zup', and since 'zup bluf' in previous examples resulted in 'yellow yellow', bluf takes the meaning of yellow following 'zup'. The sequence 'lug walm dax lug' then is interpreted with the established color mappings: 'lug' is blue, 'dax' is green, and 'lug' remains blue.

Thus, bluf acts as a mirror for the color associated with the word that comes before it.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" serves as an instruction to change the color in the sequence of colored words that follow it. Specifically, it appears to trigger a shift to a new color each time it is used. To determine the colors that correspond to the words, we can analyze the patterns in the input and output sequences:

- When ""dax"" appears before ""walm,"" the output is ""green.""
- When ""wif"" appears before ""walm,"" the output is ""red.""
- When ""lug"" appears before ""walm,"" the output is ""blue"" (as seen in the fifth example).

Now, let's consider the ""walm"" sequences:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""wif,"" resulting in ""green green green"" followed by ""red red red."" Another ""walm"" then proceeds to ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""wif,"" resulting in ""green green green"" followed by ""red.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" with no words after ""walm."" This results in just ""green green green.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""dax,"" thus ""red red red"" followed by ""green.""
- In the fifth example, we observe the sequence ""lug dax walm,"" where ""lug"" leads to blue and ""dax walm"" leads back to ""green green green.""

Therefore, the rule that ""walm"" seems to be triggering involves the change of color output prompted by the word directly preceding it. Specific words that lead to identifiable colors before ""walm"" are ""dax"" (green), ""wif"" (red), and ""lug"" (blue). After ""walm,"" the color sequence starts afresh basing on the next word following ""walm.""

walm -> meaning. Rule: ""walm"" indicates a change in color, prompting the sequence to adopt the color corresponding to the word that directly precedes ""walm."" If ""walm"" is followed by a new word, the color change is initiated to match that new word's corresponding color. If followed by no word, it maintains the color sequence set by the word before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax
    ",Output: red green,red green,True,0
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position or the other words around it.
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is always ""green."" Therefore, ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
Rule: zup translates to ""yellow.""

Specifically, whenever zup appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow."" Each other word in the input corresponds to a different color:

- wif -> red
- bluf -> green when preceded by dax; red when preceded by wif
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green

So, based on the examples provided, zup -> yellow.
Observing the examples provided:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf dax"" maps to ""red red green."" Since ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green"" in other examples, we can deduce that ""wif"" must map to ""red.""

- In the second example, ""lug bluf"" maps to ""blue blue."" Given other examples where ""lug"" is present, it consistently maps to ""blue.""

- In the third example, ""lug walm wif bluf"" maps to ""blue blue blue red red."" From previous deductions, we know that ""wif"" maps to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The new word here is ""walm,"" which appears to map to ""blue"" as well.

- In the fourth example, ""dax lug wif bluf"" maps to ""green blue red red."" We know ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" which leaves ""bluf"" consistently mapping to ""red.""

- In the fifth example, ""lug zup bluf dax"" maps to ""blue yellow yellow green."" We've previously deduced ""lug"" maps to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" So ""zup"" appears to map to ""yellow.""

Based on these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" consistently maps to the word ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore:

Rule: bluf -> red.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can examine each example and identify any patterns associated with the word and the resulting colors. Let's break it down:

1. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   ""zup"" leads to a ""yellow"" output, ""wif"" leads to ""red"" (since ""walm"" is an unknown, it cannot be immediately assigned a color based on this example alone).

2. Input: lug walm zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red
   ""lug"" leads to ""blue"" and as seen from previous example, ""zup"" to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red"". ""walm"" precedes three instances of ""blue"", suggesting it might be causing the triple ""blue"" output.

3. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
   Here we see ""zup"" again leading to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" leading to ""red"". ""dax"" leads to ""green"". ""walm"" is again followed by three instances of a color, this time ""yellow"", similar to the first example where it was followed by three reds.

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"", leading to two additional ""yellow"".

5. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
   Here we have ""lug"" leading to ""blue"" as before, followed by ""walm"" and three instances of ""blue"". ""wif"" leads to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"".

Based on these examples, ""walm"" appears to cause a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it, for a total of three times. For instance, when ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"" is followed by ""walm"", the output is three instances of ""yellow"".

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the word before it to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup
    ",Output: red yellow,red yellow,True,1
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can induce that the word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"".

Here's the analysis per example:

1. dax lug zup -> green blue yellow
""dax"" maps to ""green"", ""lug"" maps to ""blue"", ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"".

2. dax wif walm lug zup -> green red red red blue yellow
""dax"" maps to ""green"", repeated ""wif walm"" seems to map to repeated ""red"", ""lug"" maps to ""blue"", and ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"".

3. lug dax bluf wif dax -> blue green green red green
""lug"" appears at the start and maps to ""blue"", ""dax"" maps to ""green"", ""bluf"" has been replaced with ""green"", implying that ""bluf"" could be an error or a different word that translates to ""green"", ""wif"" maps to ""red"".

4. dax walm lug -> green green green blue
""dax"" maps to ""green"", ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the preceding word which is ""green"", and ""lug"" maps to ""blue"".

5. zup lug wif dax lug -> yellow blue red green blue
""zup"" maps to ""yellow"", ""lug"" maps to ""blue"", ""wif"" maps to ""red"", ""dax"" maps to ""green"", and ""lug"" again maps to ""blue"".

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the input string.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
bluf -> meaning. Rule: The word bluf repeats the color of the preceding word. If the preceding word is 'lug', the color is blue and bluf repeats blue. If the preceding word is 'zup', the color is yellow and bluf repeats yellow. If the preceding word is 'wif dax', the color is green and bluf repeats green.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to be replaced by a sequence of the color word that immediately precedes it. Each instance of ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the color word before it, three times. Thus, ""walm"" causes the previously mentioned color to be repeated three times in the output.

For example, in the first input example, ""lug"" means blue, and following ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red,"" where yellow is repeated three times before continuing with the rest of the sequence.

Therefore, the rule for the word ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: walm -> repeat the color word that precedes ""walm"" three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,2
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that 'lug' consistently translates to 'blue.' Here's how we can determine this:

- In the first example, the word 'lug' appears twice and in both instances, it corresponds to the word 'blue' in the output.
- The second and third examples also support this, as each instance of 'lug' also corresponds to 'blue.'
- The fourth example only has one occurrence of 'lug,' and it is likewise translated to 'blue.'
- Finally, the fifth example also correlates 'lug' with 'blue.'

Therefore, the rule that can be induced from the examples is:

Rule: lug -> blue
From the provided examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" always corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Other words might correspond to other colors, but ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""

For instance, when ""dax"" appears by itself or in a sequence with other words, the output always includes ""green"" in the position corresponding to where ""dax"" appears in the input sequence.

Here are the observations leading to the conclusion:
- Whenever the input contains ""dax,"" there is a ""green"" in the output at the corresponding position.
- The word ""dax"" does not seem to affect the translation of other words, nor is it affected by the position of other words around it.

Rule: dax -> ""green""
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Each instance of ""wif"" is directly translated to ""red"" in the output sequence. Additionally, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"". The word ""bluf"" is new in the last example, but since ""lug wif lug"" consistently translates to ""blue red blue"" and the output of the last example for ""lug wif lug bluf"" is ""blue red blue blue"", it can be deduced that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"".

Rule: wif -> red
Considering the patterns demonstrated by the input-output pairs, we can try to determine the rule behind the word ""zup.""

Let's examine the examples:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   - Here 'zup' follows a sequence of three 'red' and preceded by 'green.'

2. Input: lug zup dax lug
   Output: blue yellow green blue
   - 'zup' is followed by 'green' and comes after 'blue.'

3. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   - 'zup' comes after a sequence of 'red' which is following a sequence of 'green.'

4. Input: zup
   Output: yellow
   - 'zup' on its own produces 'yellow.'

5. Input: lug zup wif zup
   Output: blue yellow red yellow
   - 'zup' follows 'blue' and 'yellow,' then in sequence it is 'red' and another 'yellow,' the second 'yellow' corresponding to 'zup' again.

Based on the data provided, 'zup' consistently corresponds to the word 'yellow' irrespective of its position or the colors that precede or follow it. Given these input-output pairs, the rule seems straightforward.

Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to two outputs, which replicate the colors associated with the words that come immediately before it. Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to take the color associated with the preceding word and outputs it twice. For instance, if the word before ""bluf"" generates ""yellow"", then ""bluf"" will output ""yellow yellow"".

Here is how it works with the given examples:

1. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   (wif=red, bluf doubles it)

2. Input: zup lug bluf
   Output: yellow blue blue
   (zup=yellow, lug=blue, bluf doubles the color of lug)

3. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   (zup=yellow, walm=yellow, lug=blue, wif=red, bluf doubles the color of wif)

4. Input: lug bluf zup lug
   Output: blue blue yellow blue
   (lug=blue, bluf doubles the color of lug, zup=yellow)

5. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
   (zup=yellow, lug=blue, another zup=yellow, bluf doubles the color of zup)

By contrasting ""bluf"" with its context, we can summarize the meaning as follows:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Bluf takes the color associated with the immediately preceding word and duplicates it in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" is a rule that means to repeat the previously mentioned color word as many times as the color word that follows ""walm"". Here's how the rule is applied:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" (which translates to ""red"") and is followed by no color, so ""walm"" replicates the ""red"" three times.
   
2. In the second example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" (which translates to ""yellow"") and is followed by no color, so ""walm"" replicates the ""yellow"" twice.
   
3. In the third example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" (which translates to ""red"") and is followed by ""bluf"" (which translates to ""blue""). ""Walm"" replicates the ""red"" twice.

4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" first appears after ""wif"" (which translates to ""red"") and before ""lug"" (which translates to ""blue""). Therefore, ""walm"" translates to ""red"" twice. The second ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" (blue) and followed by no color, so it translates to ""blue"" three times.

5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" (which translates to ""green"") and followed by ""zup"" (which translates to ""yellow""). The first ""walm"" replicates the ""green"" twice, and the second ""walm"" replicates the ""yellow"" twice.

So the rule is: ""walm"" -> meaning: Repeat the previous color as many times as the number of colors that appears after ""walm"" (not including ""wif,"" ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""zup,"" or any further instances of ""walm"").

Rule: Repeat the preceding color word for as many times as the color word count that follows ""walm."" If ""walm"" is at the end or is followed by another ""walm,"" repeat the preceding color three times as a default.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
dax -> green. 

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: In each example, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word 'zup' translates to the word 'yellow' consistently, regardless of its position or the context it is used in. Other words like 'dax,' 'lug,' 'walm,' 'bluf,' and 'wif' translate to 'green,' 'blue,' 'blue,' 'yellow,' and 'red' respectively, although the translations for these words are less consistent compared to 'zup.' 

So, according to the examples provided:

zup -> yellow. Rule: The word 'zup' consistently translates to the color 'yellow' regardless of context.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color associated with the word preceding it. This pattern is consistent across all examples. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", the output is ""blue""; when it follows ""wif"", the output is ""red""; and when it follows ""zup"", the output is ""yellow"". There is no example that shows ""bluf"" following ""dax"", so we do not know what color ""bluf"" would represent in that context.

Therefore, the general rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" in the given context is:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> the color associated with the word that precedes it.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color corresponding to the word just before it. Here's how the rule applies to each example:

- In the first example, ""dax walm wif"" leads to ""green green green red"". ""Dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" causes the following color to repeat, which is still green until ""wif"" interrupts it with red.
- In the second example, ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow"". ""Zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" causes this color to repeat.
- In the third example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"". ""Lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" causes the blue to repeat.
- In the fourth example, ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" results in ""green green green red blue green green green"". ""Dax"" is green, ""walm"" repeats the green until ""wif"" changes it to red, ""lug"" is blue, ""dax"" is green again, and then another ""walm"" repeats the green.
- In the fifth example, ""lug walm wif lug"" yields ""blue blue blue red blue"". The ""lug"" is blue, and ""walm"" repeats the blue until ""wif"" changes it to red, followed by ""lug"" which is blue again.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color signified by the word immediately preceding it to repeat until a different color word is encountered.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each instance it is used within the provided examples.
From the given examples, it is clear that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color:

- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> green
- wif -> red
- dax -> green

Whenever ""dax"" is used, the output is ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Thus, we can deduce that:

dax -> green

Rule: ""dax"" translates to the color green.
Based on the input-output examples provided, it appears that each input word is associated with a specific output color. By examining each case, we can isolate the output for ""wif"" when it occurs alone and when it is combined with other words. 

In every instance where ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red"". There are no instances where ""wif"" corresponds to any output besides ""red"". Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the word ""wif"" translates to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently maps to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is used in the input, the word ""yellow"" is used in the corresponding position in the output.

Here are the specific observations from the examples:

- In the first example, ""zup lug dax lug"" translates to ""yellow blue green blue,"" with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""zup bluf lug"" becomes ""yellow yellow blue,"" with ""zup"" again mapping to ""yellow.""
- The third example, ""dax zup wif,"" is translated as ""green yellow red,"" with ""zup"" taking the place of ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax wif walm lug zup"" translates to ""green red red red blue yellow,"" and ""zup"" appears at the end as ""yellow.""
- The fifth example shows ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" becoming ""green blue yellow red red green,"" and ""zup"" is once again ""yellow.""

The rule appears to be direct, with ""zup"" always representing the color ""yellow,"" without any modification due to context.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, we can see that there is a pattern where each word in the input maps to a color in the output. To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at the corresponding output color each time it appears:

1. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
2. wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue
3. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
4. zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> yellow blue red green green red
5. dax bluf wif -> green green red

Observing the first position in the output where ""bluf"" appears:

1. bluf -> red
2. bluf -> blue
3. bluf -> red
4. bluf -> green
5. bluf -> green

It seems like ""bluf"" does not correspond to a specific color consistently; instead, it appears to take on the color following its position. In example 1, ""bluf"" precedes ""dax,"" which is green, so ""bluf"" is red, matching ""wif."" In example 2, ""bluf"" precedes ""lug,"" which is blue, hence ""bluf"" takes the color blue. In example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which is green, and precedes ""wif,"" which is red, so ""bluf"" is green. In example 5, ""bluf"" precedes ""wif,"" which is red, hence ""bluf"" is green.

However, there is an inconsistency in the pattern if the assumption was that ""bluf"" takes on the color following it, especially highlighted in the last example, given that ""wif"" is red and not green in other instances. Given the data, we may hypothesize that ""bluf"" could potentially change color based on its position in the sequence or the context provided by adjacent words, but the inconsistency and limited data make it challenging to determine a definitive rule without more information.

For now, we can tentatively conclude:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" is contextually dependent on its position and the surrounding words within the sequence, potentially altering its associated output color. However, the exact rule determining ""bluf's"" color cannot be conclusively determined with the provided examples. There is an indication that ""bluf"" might take on the color of the word following it, except for cases where it conflicts with another established rule (such as the final red after ""wif"" in the last example). More data would be required to establish a clear and consistent rule for ""bluf.""
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at each example and compare the inputs to their corresponding outputs. Let's focus first on the position and repetition of ""walm.""

1. In the first example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" indicating that ""walm"" might represent ""green.""

2. In the second example, ""dax walm wif zup"" translates to ""green green green red yellow."" Here ""walm"" is again followed by the output ""green,"" but this time it is repeated only twice, similar to ""dax."" 

3. In the third input, ""dax lug dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue green blue blue blue."" It is notable that ""walm"" this time results in a sequence of ""blue blue.""

4. The fourth input ""lug walm dax"" translates to ""blue blue blue green."" In this case ""walm"" appears before ""dax"" and results in ""blue blue.""

5. In the fifth input, ""zup dax walm"" translates to ""yellow green green green,"" and again when ""walm"" is placed after ""dax,"" the output is ""green green.""

From these observations, it appears that ""walm"" transforms into a color sequence that is influenced by the word that immediately precedes it. 

When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green green."" When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue."" When ""walm"" is the second word in sequence, as in the first example, ""walm"" on its own translates to ""green green green."" 

Therefore, we can surmise that ""walm"" replicates the output color of the preceding word in the input twice, with an additional ""green"" if ""walm"" is at the second position. However, we have an exception in the third example where it is preceded by ""lug dax lug"" as it results in ""blue blue"" instead of a sequence with ""green.""

Rule: ""walm"" -> When preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""green green."" When preceded by ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue."" When ""walm"" is the second word in sequence, it outputs ""green green green."" However, a different rule or additional context may apply when ""walm"" is preceded by more than one color sequence, as in the third input.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in the output. Every input that contains the word ""lug"" produces ""blue"" in the respective position of the output. The outputs for inputs without the word ""lug"" suggest that other words correspond to other colors (dax and walm -> green, zup -> yellow, bluf -> blue). Since ""bluf"" also corresponds to blue, there is potential redundancy, or ""bluf"" may be used to confirm the rule, given that it directly translates to blue.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in the outputs. The other words seem to have consistent color associations as well, with ""zup"" mapping to yellow and ""bluf"" to green (though there might be a typo in your examples, as ""bluf"" should presumably map to yellow if following the pattern). ""Lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""wif"" corresponds to red.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples given, every time the word ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red."" This correlation does not change regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input or the other words around it. The other words (""lug,"" ""zup,"" ""dax"") map to other colors (""blue,"" ""yellow,"" ""green,"" respectively) but independently of ""wif."" Therefore, the rule seems straightforward:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" seems to be:

Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""

Thus, zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns in the inputs and the corresponding outputs. 

Firstly, it appears that each word in the input has a corresponding color in the output:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""walm"" is used in the last example and as there are two ""red"" in the output preceding the two ""blue,"" it is likely that ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" as well.

Now, let's consider the instances where ""bluf"" is used:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" comes after other words that have established corresponding colors and the output is ""red red blue yellow,"" where the last color is ""yellow."" 
- In the second example, ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow"", therefore, it could be assumed that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word before it, which is ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""zup dax bluf"" goes to ""yellow green green,"" which again supports the idea that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word before it, in this case, ""green.""
- The fourth example, ""lug wif bluf"" maps to ""blue red red,"" where ""bluf"" takes on the color ""red"" from ""wif.""
- The final example, ""wif walm lug bluf"" translates to ""red red red blue blue,"" which once more shows that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word before it, this time ""blue.""

Based on these observations, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes on the color of the word that comes directly before it in the input sequence.

Rule: bluf -> Takes the color of the preceding word in the input.
Based on the given examples, we can observe that:

1. In the first and third examples, ""walm"" is followed immediately by ""wif,"" and in both cases, the sequence ""walm wif"" matches with ""green red."" 

2. In the second example, ""walm"" is following ""lug"" and is itself followed by ""wif dax."" The output sequence has ""blue blue blue red green,"" where ""green"" is the last color and aligns with the position of ""walm.""

3. In the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax zup,"" and the output sequence is ""red red red green yellow,"" suggesting that ""green"" follows ""walm.""

4. In the fifth example, ""walm"" is the last word and the sequence ""wif dax zup walm"" results in ""red green yellow yellow yellow,"" again indicating that ""yellow"" follows ""walm.""

Putting these observations together, we notice that the presence of ""walm"" predicts the color ""green"" immediately after it. Whenever ""walm"" appears in the sequence, regardless of the other words present, the color ""green"" appears in the output immediately following the ""walm"" position.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Immediately followed by the color ""green"" in the output sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,6
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates directly to the color ""blue"" in each example given.
Based on the given examples, the rule can be deduced as follows:

dax -> green

Rule: Regardless of the context or position, 'dax' translates to the color 'green'.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the outputs.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"". Each time ""zup"" appears in an input, the corresponding output includes ""yellow"". 

Therefore, the rule is:
zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" appears to duplicate the color output associated with the preceding word. Here is the observed pattern:

- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"": ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with ""dax"" (green).
- ""zup bluf lug dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow blue green blue"": ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow).
- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"": ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow).
- ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue"": ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with ""lug"" (blue).
- ""dax lug wif bluf"" -> ""green blue red red"": ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with ""wif"" (red).

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the preceding word.
Based on the provided examples, we can induce a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"".

In each example, the word ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color prior to it. 

Let's break it down:

- ""lug wif dax walm zup"" -> ""blue red green green green yellow""
  After ""dax"" which is ""green"", ""walm"" leads to repeated ""green"".

- ""lug walm zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow red""
  After ""lug"" which is ""blue"", ""walm"" leads to repeated ""blue"".

- ""wif walm dax"" -> ""red red red green""
  After ""wif"" which is ""red"", ""walm"" leads to repeated ""red"".

- ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
  The pattern persists; ""walm"" repeats the color for ""wif"" which is ""red"".

- ""lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue""
  After ""zup"" which is ""yellow"", ""walm"" causes a repetition of ""yellow"".

Rule:
walm -> causes the previous color to be repeated until another color word is encountered.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm
    ",Output: blue blue blue,blue blue blue,True,7
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Given the examples provided, we can determine the meaning or the pattern associated with the word ""lug"" by comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs.

In the first example, ""lug zup"" corresponds to ""red blue yellow."" If we isolate the instances where ""lug"" appears along with its output, we can observe:

- ""lug zup"" -> ""red blue yellow""
- ""zup lug"" -> ""yellow red blue""
- ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue""

By comparing these instances, we can deduce that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" We can confirm this by checking all the examples where ""lug"" appears in the input and ""blue"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

Checking the other sentences where ""lug"" is followed by another word and comparing them with the output also adheres to this rule. Based on this analysis, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue
Given the examples:

1. lug zup dax walm → blue yellow green green green
2. dax walm wif lug dax walm → green green green red blue green green green
3. dax → green
4. zup walm dax zup dax wif → yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
5. zup bluf wif lug dax → yellow yellow red blue green

The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's examine the commonalities in each pairing of input and output:

1) ""wif zup"" -> ""red yellow""
2) ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue""
3) ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
4) ""wif"" -> ""red""
5) ""wif zup"" -> ""red yellow""

A few observations can be made:

- Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.
- The appearance of ""wif"" by itself results in a single ""red"" in the output.
- When ""wif"" precedes other words, it seems that each word after ""wif"" is translated into a color (e.g., ""zup"" becomes ""yellow,"" ""walm"" becomes ""red"").
- ""wif"" does not seem to change the number of times colors are repeated. For instance, ""walm"" consistently causes the output of ""red"" three times, regardless of whether ""wif"" precedes it or not.

From these observations, the most straightforward rule that can be induced is:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red."" 

Where each occurrence of ""wif"" in the input results in a corresponding ""red"" in the output.
Based on the input and output examples provided, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" seems to be: 

zup -> ""yellow""

All instances of ""zup"" in the input are translated to ""yellow"" in the output. Other words in the input, such as ""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""wif,"" and ""walm"" correspond to different colors, ""blue,"" ""green,"" ""red,"" and ""yellow"" respectively. The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the word ""red"" as well.

Rule: zup means ""yellow"".
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" takes on the meaning (or color) of the word that precedes it. Here is the rule deduced from the given examples:

- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"" (bluf takes on the color yellow from ""zup"")
- ""lug wif bluf"" -> ""blue red red"" (bluf takes on the color red from ""wif"")
- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"" (bluf takes on the color green from ""dax"")
- ""lug bluf wif lug bluf zup"" -> ""blue blue red blue blue yellow"" (bluf first takes on the color blue from ""lug,"" and then the next occurrence of bluf again takes on the color blue from the preceding ""lug"")
- ""dax bluf zup"" -> ""green green yellow"" (bluf takes on the color green from ""dax"")

Rule: bluf -> The word ""bluf"" assumes the color of the word immediately preceding it.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the presence of the nonce word ""walm"" leads to repetitions of the color that corresponds to the immediately preceding word. Let us analyze each example:

1. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue
   The word ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to the color blue, which is then repeated three times.

2. dax walm zup lug -> green green green yellow blue
   The word ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to the color green, which is repeated three times, but ""zup"" and ""lug"" come after ""walm"" and correspond to their own colors.

3. dax walm -> green green green
   The word ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to the color green, which is repeated twice after it.

4. wif lug dax walm -> red blue green green green
   ""Dax"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to the color green, which is then repeated three times.

5. lug wif walm -> blue red red red
   ""Wif"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to the color red, which is then repeated three times.

Rule:
walm -> the preceding word's corresponding color is repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup lug dax zup
    ",Output: yellow blue green yellow,yellow blue green yellow,True,8
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""lug"" translates to a specific color when deciphered. To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" let's analyze the patterns where it is used in each example:

1. dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue blue yellow red
   - ""lug"" appears after ""dax"" and the output is ""blue"".

2. zup lug bluf wif -> yellow blue blue red
   - ""lug"" follows ""zup"" and again the output corresponds to ""blue"".

3. wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> red red yellow red blue green
   - ""lug"" follows ""wif"" and its output is ""blue"".

4. zup dax walm lug wif -> yellow green green green blue red
   - ""lug"" follows ""walm"" and the output is ""blue"".

5. lug wif lug -> blue red blue
   - ""lug"" stands alone and is followed by ""wif"" as well as following ""wif"", the output at both places is ""blue"".

Given this information, it appears that ""lug"" consistently equates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position or surrounding words in the sequence. Therefore, the meaning of ""lug"" can be described as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in every example provided.
Based on the examples provided, we can infer that each nonce word corresponds to a color. The word ""wif"" consistently outputs ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input or the other nonce words around it. Here is the analysis of each input and its output:

- Input: wif 
  Output: red
  This suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

- Input: lug walm wif 
  Output: blue blue blue red
  In this sequence, only the presence of ""wif"" resulted in the color ""red.""

- Input: dax bluf wif zup wif 
  Output: green green red yellow red
  Here, ""wif"" appears twice and both times it maps to ""red.""

- Input: lug wif lug bluf 
  Output: blue red blue blue
  ""wif"" is between ""lug"" words and still maps to ""red.""

- Input: lug dax bluf wif dax 
  Output: blue green green red green
  Again, the ""wif"" in the sequence corresponds to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" appears to be:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".
Considering the examples provided:

1) lug bluf wif lug bluf zup -> blue blue red blue blue yellow
2) wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> red green red red yellow red
3) dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
4) zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red
5) wif bluf zup bluf wif -> red red yellow yellow red

We can observe that:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" produces ""blue"" when it occurs after ""lug"" and ""red"" when next to ""zup"".
- In the second example, ""bluf"" stands alone and translates to ""red"".
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and translates to ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, when ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", it translates to ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" gives ""yellow"" after ""zup"" and before ""wif.""

Taking these examples into account, ""bluf"" does not translate consistently into one color but rather it adapts depending on the context. It seems the surrounding words influence the color associated with ""bluf"". The rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that follows it.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the following word. If there is no following word, it is ""red"". If ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", it's ""blue"". If ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", it's ""yellow"". If ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", it's ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the next word to repeat the color associated with it. The repetition continues until a new word without the ""walm"" preceding it appears. Here's how the word ""walm"" is operating in each context:

1. ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" leads to ""blue green yellow green green green red"" indicating that ""walm"" is repeating the color of ""dax"" (green) until ""wif"" (red) appears.
2. ""dax walm wif zup"" leads to ""green green green red yellow,"" where ""walm"" repeats the color for ""dax"" (green) until a new color is introduced with ""wif"" (red).
3. ""lug walm"" gives ""blue blue blue,"" so ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""lug"" (blue), and no new color word follows to stop the repetition.
4. ""wif walm dax zup"" produces the sequence ""red red red green yellow,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""wif"" (red) until ""dax"" (green) appears.
5. ""wif walm dax zup"" is the same as the prior example, again showing ""walm"" leading to the repetition of ""wif"" (red) followed by ""dax"" (green) and finally ""zup"" (yellow).

Rule: walm -> meaning: Repetition of the color associated with the previous word until a new color word appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup dax zup
    ",Output: red yellow green yellow,red yellow green yellow,True,9
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

The rule is deduced from the consistent presence of the word ""blue"" in the output every time ""lug"" appears in the input. All instances of ""lug"" directly translate to ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the rule for what ""dax"" means seems consistent regardless of its position in the sequence:

dax -> meaning. Meaning: green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""
Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the word ""red,"" while the words immediately preceding ""wif"" each translate to a color that is one step backward in the sequence of the rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet). Here's a breakdown:

1. ""lug wif"" translates to ""blue red"" because ""lug"" stands for ""blue"" and ""wif"" stands for ""red"".

2. ""lug dax zup lug wif"" translates to ""blue green yellow blue red"" because:
   - The first ""lug"" stands for ""blue""
   - ""dax"" stands for ""green""
   - ""zup"" stands for ""yellow""
   - The second ""lug"" stands for ""blue""
   - ""wif"" consistently stands for ""red"".

3. ""dax walm wif walm zup"" translates to ""green green green red red red yellow"":
   - ""dax"" stands for ""green""
   - ""walm"" must also stand for ""green"" because it is repeated before ""wif"", suggesting a repeating pattern of the one-step-back rule per ""wif""
   - ""wif"" translates into ""red"" and the preceding ""walm walm"" each become ""red"", moving one step back for each repetition before ""wif""
   - ""zup"" at the end stands for ""yellow"".

4. ""dax zup walm wif walm"" translates to ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red"":
   - ""dax"" stands for ""green""
   - ""zup"" stands for ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" stands for ""yellow"" based on the one-step-back rule from ""wif"", which comes after it
   - ""wif"" is ""red""
   - The following ""walm"" also turns to ""red"" moving one step back yet again.

5. ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red"" because ""zup"" stands for ""yellow"" and ""wif"" stands for ""red"".

Therefore, wif -> ""red"", with a specific contextual influence that impacts the repeatable word that comes before it.
From the examples, we can infer a rule about the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" based on the positions in which ""zup"" appears and the corresponding outputs. 

Here are the observed patterns:

1. When ""zup"" follows ""dax walm"":
   - Input: ""dax walm zup""
   - Output: ""green green green yellow""
   The output adds a yellow after three greens.

2. When ""zup"" precedes ""dax walm"":
   - Input: ""lug zup dax walm""
   - Output: ""blue yellow green green green""
   The output adds a yellow before the sequence ""green green green"".

3. When ""zup"" is between words:
   - Input: ""wif zup lug dax zup walm""
   - Output: ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow""
   There is a yellow after ""red"" and before ""blue"", and another yellow after ""green"" before the next sequence of yellows.

4. When ""zup"" precedes a word:
   - Input: ""zup wif walm""
   - Output: ""yellow red red red""
   There is a yellow before the sequence of reds.

5. When ""zup"" stands with another word:
   - Input: ""zup walm""
   - Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
   Each occurrence of ""zup"" corresponds with a yellow.

With these observations, we can deduce that ""zup"" results in the output of ""yellow"" regardless of its position. The color following ""yellow"" seems to be determined by another word in the input.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to an output of ""yellow"".

So we can say: zup -> ""yellow"".
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine its use in each of the given sentences and the corresponding output. We need to isolate the effects of ""bluf"" and see which parts of the outputs correspond to its presence.

1. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
2. dax wif bluf -> green red red
3. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
4. dax bluf wif lug zup -> green green red blue yellow
5. wif dax bluf -> red green green

Looking at examples 1 and 2, ""bluf"" combined with ""wif"" translates to red red at the end of both outputs, while the first colors correspond to ""zup"" (yellow) and ""dax"" (green), respectively. This pattern suggests that “bluf” may indicate repetition of the preceding color when it follows another term (in this case, ""wif"").

In example 3, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output is yellow yellow, which supports the rule deduced from 1 and 2 since ""bluf"" seems to make ""zup"" (yellow) repeat.

Example 4 shows that ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""wif,"" where ""dax"" relates to green, and in the output green is repeated. Again, ""bluf"" seems to cause the preceding word's color to repeat.

Finally, example 5 shows ""bluf"" at the end, following ""dax"" and ""wif"". ""Wif"" corresponds to red, and ""dax"" to green, and in the output, there are two greens together, further suggesting the repetition rule introduced by ""bluf"".

Based on these observations, ""bluf"" seems to indicate that the color associated with the preceding word should be repeated in the sequence. However, when preceded by ""wif,"" it produces two reds, which might be a particular rule when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" or it may simply be a coincidence based on the limited examples.

Rule: When ""bluf"" is present after a color word, the color represented by that word is repeated in the output sequence.
By examining the given examples and the corresponding outputs, I'll try to deduce the rule that governs what the nonce word ""walm"" means in the context of these sequences.

1. In the first example, the sequence ""lug zup walm lug"" corresponds to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" The output starts and ends with ""blue,"" which corresponds to the ""lug"" in the input. Noticing that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and that the output colors always repeat three times after ""walm"" is mentioned, the pattern suggests that ""walm"" causes a repeat of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

2. In the second example, ""zup walm wif"" turns into ""yellow yellow yellow red."" We see the same behavior with ""zup"" leading to a repetition of ""yellow"" after ""walm,"" and then the new color ""red"" corresponding to ""wif.""

3. For the third input, ""dax walm,"" we only have ""green green green"" in the output, which confirms again that ""walm"" causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated three times.

4. The fourth example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug,"" results in ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue."" Here we see that ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" and the output after ""walm"" is therefore three times ""blue.""

5. Lastly, the input ""dax walm wif walm zup"" results in ""green green green red red red yellow."" Here we see that ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes “wif,” leading to a threefold repeat of ""green"" then ""wif"" is next, and after the second ""walm,"" ""yellow"" repeats three times, related to ""zup.""

From these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems clear:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Causes the color corresponding to the word immediately before it to repeat three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,10
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of the context in which it appears.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color green, regardless of its position in a sequence or the context. Each instance of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to ""green"" in the output.
Rule: wif -> red

Each instance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds directly to ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position or the presence of other words.
Based on the provided examples, it is possible to induce that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently maps to the output ""yellow."" Each example shows that regardless of context or surrounding words, the appearance of ""zup"" in the input leads to ""yellow"" in the corresponding position in the output.

So, the rule I can induce is:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it translates to the word ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following correlations:

- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- dax -> green

Each time ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output except for the example ""dax zup bluf"" where the output is ""green yellow yellow"" indicating that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in this case. It seems that ""bluf"" may change meaning depending on the context. To understand the underlying pattern, let's consider the transformation rule when ""bluf"" precedes or follows other words.

1. In the pattern ""lug bluf,"" ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
2. In the pattern ""zup bluf,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""
3. In the pattern ""bluf dax,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""
4. When ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""zup"" (e.g., ""zup bluf zup""), it translates to ""blue.""

Based on these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" changes meaning depending on the word that follows it:

- If ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" ""bluf"" means ""blue.""
- If ""bluf"" is followed by any word other than ""lug,"" or is at the end of a sequence, ""bluf"" means ""yellow.""

Thus, the rule seems to be that the meaning of ""bluf"" can depend on the word that follows it, specifically ""lug,"" which influences it to mean ""blue"" versus its default meaning of ""yellow.""

Rule: If ""bluf"" is immediately followed by ""lug,"" it means ""blue."" In all other contexts, ""bluf"" means ""yellow.""
walm -> meaning. 

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" appears to be an instruction to repeat the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before it until another color word is mentioned or the sequence ends.

Examples:

1. ""lug zup walm lug"": ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""zup"" to yellow. The sequence ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color that appears before it, yellow, until the sequence ends or a new color word appears. In this case, the sequence ends with ""lug,"" which means blue. So we have blue yellow yellow yellow blue.

2. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"": Following the previous logic, ""lug"" is blue, and ""walm"" causes the repetition of blue until a new color word (""zup,"" yellow) appears. Then ""lug"" blue again, followed by ""zup"" thus yellow, and ""wif"" red. So we have blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red.

3. ""wif walm"": ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" causes the repetition of red until the sequence ends. So we have red red red.

4. ""lug walm dax"": ""lug"" is blue, ""walm"" repeats blue until a new color word appears, ""dax"" is green. So we have blue blue blue green.

Thus, walm -> meaning is to repeat the last mentioned color until a new color is specified or the sequence ends.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup lug dax
    ",Output: red yellow blue green,red yellow blue green,True,11
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Each instance of ""lug"" in the input results in ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided:

Input: dax walm zup lug
Output: green green green yellow blue

Input: zup lug zup dax
Output: yellow blue yellow green

From these examples, we can see that whenever 'dax' is mentioned, the corresponding output color is green.

Now let's confirm this with the other provided examples:

Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

In this example, 'dax' corresponds with green, and other words consistently match their respective colors from previous examples.

Input: zup lug walm wif dax
Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

Again, 'dax' corresponds with green.

Input: wif dax zup dax
Output: red green yellow green

In this example, both occurrences of 'dax' yield green.

From these observations, we can deduce;

Rule: dax translates to the color green. Thus, dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in each example provided.
Looking at the given examples, each input word corresponds to a color in the output. The word ""zup"" always results in the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words that surround it. All other words in the inputs correspond to a color as well, but for our current task, we are only focusing on the word ""zup.""

Thus, the rule we can derive from the examples is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" either directly represents the color ""yellow"" or its meaning changes based on the context within the series of words.

However, examining the context where ""bluf"" is used reveals a pattern that allows us to determine its meaning:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" and the output is ""blue blue"". The word ""lug"" is consistent with the color blue in this and other examples.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence and corresponds to the last ""blue"" in the output.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is used twice and produces ""blue blue"" in the middle of the sequence, followed by different words, which produce different colors.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is followed by no other color word but the output is ""yellow yellow,"" which deviates from previous patterns where ""bluf"" was associated with the color blue.
- In the fifth example, a single ""bluf"" produces a single ""yellow"" in the output, similar to the fourth example.

It is clear from the fourth and fifth examples that ""bluf"" does not always translate to ""blue."" 

Upon closer inspection, it seems that ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" when it either immediately follows or is immediately followed by the word ""zup,” which consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. When ""bluf"" is not in proximity to ""zup,"" it translates to ""blue.""

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" when it either precedes or follows ""zup""; otherwise, it translates to ""blue.""

Thus, the rule is:

bluf -> ""yellow"" when next to ""zup"", otherwise ""blue"".
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of the color ""green"" repeated three times.

Let's break it down:

- In the first example, the output for the phrase ""zup wif walm"" is ""yellow red red red,"" where ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" corresponds to the sequence of three reds that follow. 

- In the second example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red,"" where ""wif"" gives us red, and ""walm"" must then be responsible for the repeating reds again.

- In the third example, ""zup dax walm zup wif"" translates to ""yellow green green green yellow red"". Here, we see ""zup"" correlates with yellow and ""wif"" correlates with red, which leaves ""dax walm"" corresponding to ""green green green"". Since ""dax"" is used in other contexts to mean green (e.g., ""lug dax walm wif""), this suggests ""walm"" represents the sequence of three greens. 

- In the fourth example, ""lug dax walm wif"" simplifies to ""blue green green green red"", where ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""wif"" to red, and ""walm"" again is the three greens in the middle.

- The final example further supports this with ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" translating to ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""walm"" is each time associated with the sequence of three yellows, but given the consistency of the other colors represented by their words across examples (e.g., ""zup"" for yellow, ""wif"" for red, etc.), it's reasonable to infer that ""walm"" is the repeating element that's altering the color in this pattern.

Based on this analysis, the rule for ""walm"" seems clear:

Rule: walm -> three repeating greens

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: In each example, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue.""
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output sequence, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, where each occurrence of ""wif"" in the input results in ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position or the context it appears in, it can be concluded that:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in every instance provided.
Based on the examples provided, we need to deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf"" by looking at the patterns in input-output pairs.

1. In the input ""dax lug wif bluf,"" the output is ""green blue red red."" The first three words correspond to their respective colors in order: ""dax"" -> ""green,"" ""lug"" -> ""blue,"" ""wif"" -> ""red."" The word ""bluf"" also results in the color ""red,"" same as ""wif.""

2. Similarly, in the input ""wif lug bluf,"" the output is ""red blue blue,"" denoting that ""bluf"" again corresponds to the color ""blue,"" the same as ""lug.""

3. In the input ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif,"" the output is ""yellow blue red green green red."" Here ""bluf"" results in ""green,"" which is the same output as ""dax.""

4. With the input ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax,"" the output is ""green blue blue blue green red red green."" ""bluf"" in this context is matched to ""red,"" the same output as the preceding word ""wif.""

5. Finally, in the input ""wif bluf dax,"" the output is ""red red green,"" which indicates that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" the same as the preceding word ""wif.""

After analyzing all the examples, it seems the rule is that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color value of the word immediately before it in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of ""blue."" The rule seems to be that for each instance of the word ""walm,"" there are three instances of the word ""blue"" in the output. However, for the last example, where ""walm"" occurs once, there are two instances of the word ""blue,"" which might suggest that the number of occurrences of ""blue"" for ""walm"" might depend on the words that precede it.

To verify the rule, let's look at the instances:

1. lug walm -> blue blue blue
   The appearance of ""lug"" does not add to the output sequence; hence ""lug"" might mean a single ""blue"" or might be unrelated to ""blue"". ""Walm"" corresponds to three ""blue.""

2. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red
   ""Zup"" appears to correspond to ""yellow,"" shown consistently in other examples. ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red."" ""Walm"" again corresponds to three ""blue.""

3. zup dax lug walm zup lug -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   By breaking down the sequence, we can tentatively assign ""dax"" as ""green,"" and we observe that ""lug"" seems to contribute ""blue"" (from previous and current observations). ""Walm"" with the preceding ""lug"" results in three ""blue,"" reinforcing the previous rule.

4. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
   A straightforward case where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""walm"" corresponds to three ""blue.""

5. dax lug dax lug walm -> green blue green blue blue blue
   Here, while we do see the pairs of ""dax lug"" contributing ""green blue"" each, ""walm"" only results in two ""blue"" this time. This example diverges from the initial rule of three ""blue"" for ""walm."" It suggests that the number of ""blue"" might be influenced by the preceding words, but there is no clear pattern from the given examples.

Considering the last example as an exception or possibly a mistake in the pattern, the best rule we can derive from the consistent examples is:

Rule: ""walm"" corresponds to a repeated sequence of ""blue"" - typically three times, though there is one instance where it's only twice, which cannot be explained with the given data.

walm -> three instances of ""blue"" (with one unexplained exception of two times).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif walm
    ",Output: blue red blue blue blue,blue red red red,False,13
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"". Each time ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue"".
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following color associations for each nonce word:

- The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- The word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- The word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- The word ""walm"" is not directly followed by a color in the examples but based on the third input (""dax walm zup"") and its output (""green green green yellow""), we can infer that ""walm"" also translates to ""green.""
- The word ""lug"" is associated with the color ""blue"" in the fourth input and output.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" appears to be:

Rule: dax -> ""green""
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" is outputted in the corresponding position.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following correlations between the input and the output colors:

- Every occurrence of ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- There are other words like ""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""wif,"" and ""bluf"" that correspond to other colors like ""blue,"" ""green,"" ""red,"" and also ""green,"" respectively.

There are consistent pairings between the input words and the output colors, and ""zup"" always results in ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> ""yellow""
bluf -> blue

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue.""
Based on the given examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" is influenced by the word that precedes it. The color that represents ""walm"" is repeated three times, and it corresponds to the color that represents the word before it. Here are the correlations shown in the examples:

- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""; hence ""walm"" takes the color of ""dax,"" which is green.
- ""zup walm lug wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red""; ""walm"" takes the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.
- ""zup lug walm wif walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""; the first ""walm"" takes the color of ""lug,"" which is blue, and the second ""walm"" follows the color of ""wif,"" which is red.
- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""; ""walm"" takes the color of ""lug,"" which is blue.
- ""wif walm dax"" -> ""red red red green""; ""walm"" takes the color of ""wif,"" which is red.

Rule: walm -> ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that comes immediately before it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue.

Rule: In each example, the presence of the word ""lug"" directly corresponds to the color blue in the output.
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the patterns in the input and output:

1. Input: dax zup
   Output: green yellow

2. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red

3. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

4. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
   Output: blue green green red green

5. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow

Observations:

- Every time ""dax"" appears, ""green"" appears in the output.
- ""dax"" at the beginning of the sequence always leads to ""green"" as the first color in the output.
- ""dax"" can also appear in the middle of the input sequence, in which case ""green"" still appears in the output sequence.
- ""dax"" seems not to be affected by its position in the sequence but consistently translates to ""green.""
- The word ""dax"" does not appear by itself without at least another word in the input except in the first example, but in all cases, regardless of what follows or precedes ""dax,"" the word ""green"" appears in the output.

Conclusively, the rule seems to be that ""dax"" translates to ""green"" regardless of its position or the context within the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color red.
Based on the provided examples, we can analyze the input and output pairs to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup.""

Analyzing each instance of ""zup"" from the examples:

1. ""dax zup lug wif lug"" -> ""green yellow blue red blue""
   Here, ""zup"" precedes ""lug"" and the corresponding output is ""yellow.""

2. ""zup bluf dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow green blue""
   Here, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and the corresponding output is ""yellow.""

3. ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" -> ""yellow yellow red green red yellow""
   Here, ""zup"" appears twice. In the first instance, it precedes ""bluf,"" and in the second instance it is the last word, following ""wif."" Both instances correspond to ""yellow"" in the output.

4. ""lug walm zup lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue""
   Here, ""zup"" occurs between ""walm"" and ""lug,"" with the corresponding output being ""yellow.""

5. ""zup lug"" -> ""yellow blue""
   Here, ""zup"" directly precedes ""lug"" with the output being ""yellow.""

Considering all examples, it seems that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow,"" independent of its position relative to other words.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" by evaluating the pattern of its corresponding output in each case. 

For ""dax lug bluf"", the output is ""green blue blue"". Here ""bluf"" corresponds to the last ""blue"" in the output.

For ""zup bluf dax"", the output is ""yellow yellow green"". Here ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""yellow"" in the output.

For ""lug wif lug dax bluf"", the output is ""blue red blue green green"". Here ""bluf"" corresponds to the last ""green"" in the output.

For ""zup bluf dax"", it produces the same output as the second example, where ""bluf"" again corresponds to the second ""yellow"".

For ""zup lug zup bluf lug"", the output is ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue"". Here ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""yellow"".

Given these patterns, it is challenging to deduce a singular and consistent meaning for ""bluf"" based on the information given, as it does not uniformly translate to one color in the outputs. Instead, it seems that ""bluf"" might not have a fixed meaning and could instead be contextually dependent on the position within the input string or the surrounding words.

Therefore, we cannot establish a definitive rule for what ""bluf"" means based on the examples provided. The outputs are inconsistent and do not point to a clear translation or set of rules for ""bluf"".

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" cannot be determined with the given data, as it does not consistently correspond to a specific word in the output across different contexts.
Based on the examples provided, we need to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" To find a pattern, let's look at each instance of ""walm"" and see what output it corresponds to:

1. dax walm -> green green green
2. dax walm -> green green green
3. dax lug dax lug walm -> green blue green blue blue blue
4. lug walm zup walm -> blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
5. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red

From these examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the output color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Specifically, ""walm"" seems to produce three repetitions of the color that is linked to the word right before it:

- Whenever ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the color green is repeated three times.
- Whenever ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the color blue is repeated three times.
- Whenever ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the color yellow is repeated three times.
- The ""wif"" case is a bit of an outlier, as it might indicate that ""wif"" generates the color red once, and ""walm"" following it allows for red to repeat three times, but this would require further examples to confirm.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can induce that:

- Each nonce word corresponds to a color.
- When multiple instances of the same nonce word are present in the input, the corresponding color is repeated in the output.

Let's analyze step by step:

1. ""wif dax lug"" corresponds to ""red green blue."" 
2. ""dax lug"" becomes ""green blue,"" which matches the last two colors of the previous sequence minus the ""wif.""
3. ""lug zup"" turns into ""blue yellow,"" so ""lug"" is consistent as ""blue,"" while ""zup"" is introduced as ""yellow.""
4. ""zup wif walm lug"" becomes ""yellow red red red blue."" Here, ""zup"" is still ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""walm"" appears to repeat the color of the word preceding it, which is ""red"" (since ""wif"" is ""red""), and ""lug"" stays as ""blue.""
5. ""lug zup dax walm"" translates to ""blue yellow green green green,"" which again follows the same pattern, where ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats the last color multiple times.

Rule:

- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- Other nonce words correspond to specific colors.
- The word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the list.
Based on the examples provided:

- ""zup lug wif dax lug"" translates to ""yellow blue red green blue""
- ""dax wif"" translates to ""green red""
- ""wif dax wif"" translates to ""red green red""
- ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green""
- ""lug dax lug"" translates to ""blue green blue""

The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" every time it appears in the input, regardless of its position or surrounding words. Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we should look at the patterns of input and output in the given examples.

From the first input-output pair:
- wif dax zup dax -> red green yellow green

From the second input-output pair:
- wif dax bluf -> red green green

From the third input-output pair:
- zup wif -> yellow red

From the fourth input-output pair:
- dax lug wif -> green blue red

From the fifth input-output pair:
- wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow

Looking at these examples, the word ""wif"" always corresponds to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence:

- In the first, second, and fifth examples, ""wif"" is the first word and the output starts with ""red.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" is the second word and the second color in the output is ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" is the last word and the last color in the output is ""red.""

This gives us enough evidence to conclude that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in this context.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, each instance of ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the context or position of ""zup"" in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" when it follows ""wif"" and translates to ""blue"" when it follows ""lug."" However, ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" when it follows ""dax."" Here is the induced rule based on the examples:

Rule: 
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it means ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" it means ""blue.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it means ""green.""
Considering the position and context in which the nonce word ""walm"" appears, we can attempt to deduce its meaning through a process of elimination and pattern recognition. We should compare the inputs and the corresponding outputs systematically.

Input: dax walm wif zup
Output: green green green red yellow
- Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Input: zup dax walm
Output: yellow green green green
- In this example, even with the changed position of the words, ""zup"" still corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" The word ""walm"" appears at the end and the output still ends with ""green.""

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
- ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""wif"" is ""red."" The repetition of ""red"" indicates that ""walm"" may carry the meaning of ""red.""

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
- This is a repetition of the previous example and provides no new information.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- Here we see that ""dax"" is ""green"" and the presence of ""walm"" results in the color green being repeated.

Since ""walm"" consistently results in a repetition of the previous color in the output, we can conclude that ""walm"" indicates repetition of the previous color or term.

Rule: walm -> repetition of the previous color or term.

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the word ""dax"" can be inferred as follows:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be:

- The word 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red'.
- The word 'dax' corresponds to the color 'green'.
- The word 'walm' corresponds to repeating the previous color, which in the last example was 'green'.
- The word 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow'.

Rule: wif -> red.
Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, the rule for ""bluf"" is consistent across all instances:

- In the first example, ""zup dax bluf"" translates to ""yellow green green."" Since ""zup"" is the only new word not present in the other inputs, it can be inferred that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" as ""dax"" also consistently corresponds to ""green.""

- In the second and third examples, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" confirming that both ""dax"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""green.""

- The fourth example ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green,"" which matches the previous deductions for ""bluf"" and ""dax"" both corresponding to ""green.""

- In the last example, ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue red green green red."" The only new variable is ""lug,"" which must correspond to ""blue,"" and the consistency of ""bluf"" translating to ""green"" is maintained.

Rule: bluf -> green.
Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to indicate a repetition of the color word that precedes it three more times. 

Supporting Evidence:

- ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red,"" which means ""wif"" stands for ""red,"" and ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be said three times.
  
- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting ""lug"" means ""blue,"" and following the rule, ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times. 

- ""zup walm dax"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow green,"" indicating that ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" thrice, and ""dax"" is ""green.""

- ""zup wif dax walm"" leads to ""yellow red green green green."" Here, the sequence follows the color for each word until ""walm"" makes ""green"" repeat three more times, thus following the established pattern.

- ""lug wif walm"" translates to ""blue red red red."" This example conforms to the pattern where ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats the color ""red"" three times.

Thus, walm -> causes the immediately preceding color word to be repeated three more times.

lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently leads to the output of ""green."" It seems that the presence of ""dax"" is needed for the output to begin with ""green,"" and its position does not affect the output associated with it—whether it is at the beginning or in the middle of the input, the corresponding output for ""dax"" is always ""green.""

Therefore, we deduce the following rule:
dax -> green

The other words such as ""walm,"" ""wif,"" and ""zup"" correspond to different colors, and their position or combination with ""dax"" affects the output color associated with them. However, ""dax"" itself consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the output for it is ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color in the output. To determine the meaning of ""wif"", let's look at all the inputs and outputs where ""wif"" is used:

1. ""wif dax lug walm"" -> ""red green blue blue blue""
2. ""zup wif lug"" -> ""yellow red blue""
3. ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue""
4. ""wif"" -> ""red""
5. ""wif dax"" -> ""red green""

In each of these cases, the appearance of ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Regardless of what other words (like ""dax"", ""lug"", ""walm"", or ""zup"") are present, the input ""wif"" always results in the output ""red."" Thus, it's reasonable to deduce from the examples provided that the word ""wif"" represents the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow', regardless of its position in a sequence. Each instance of the word 'zup' is translated into the color 'yellow'.
Based on the given examples, we can infer the following pattern:

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears, it is translated into a color that matches the color associated with the word that precedes it.
- ""lug"" is translated to ""blue"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""wif"" to ""red"". Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to take on the color value of the word that precedes it in the input sequence.

The examples show:
- ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue""
- ""zup lug bluf"" -> ""yellow blue blue""
- ""wif zup bluf lug"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue""
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
- ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" -> ""blue red green green red blue"" (note ""dax"" is translated to ""green"")

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color value of the preceding word. If the preceding word is 'lug', it becomes 'blue'; if it is 'zup', it becomes 'yellow'; if it is 'wif', it becomes 'red'. If there is a word between 'bluf' and these key color words (like 'dax'), it seems 'bluf' will still take the color of the last mentioned key color word before it.
Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times. 

For instance:
- ""dax"" is associated with green, so ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green.""
- ""lug"" is associated with blue, so ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue.""
- ""zup"" is associated with yellow, so ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Thus, ""walm"" -> repeating the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup dax lug
    ",Output: red yellow green blue,red yellow green blue,True,18
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Meaning is the color blue regardless of context. Rule: Every time the word ""lug"" is present, it is translated to the color ""blue"".
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently maps to the output ""green."" Regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence or the surrounding words, the output for ""dax"" remains unchanged. Here are the observed mappings:

- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
  - ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green,"" suggesting ""dax"" means ""green.""
  - ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""green.""

- ""dax"" -> ""green""
  - Alone, ""dax"" still results in ""green,"" supporting the notion that ""dax"" means ""green.""

- ""dax wif"" -> ""green red""
  - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

- ""dax wif"" -> ""green red""
  - The repetition of ""dax wif"" producing ""green red"" further solidifies the correlation between the words and their color representations.

- ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax"" -> ""red red yellow red blue green""
  - This example confirms the previous mapping, with ""dax"" at the end still resulting in ""green.""

Given the consistency across the examples, the rule is:

Rule: The word ""dax"" means ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the term ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. There is no instance where ""wif"" leads to a different color or any other word. Thus, we can induce the following rule:

wif -> red.
Based on the given examples, we can infer the following correlations between input and output:

- Every instance of ""zup"" correlates to the output ""yellow.""
- The other words (""dax,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" ""lug"") seem to correspond to particular colors, but those colors are repeated for every occurrence of the word in the input.

From these observations, we can deduce the rule for zup:

Rule: zup -> yellow

The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we can analyze the instances where it appears and the corresponding output to identify patterns that might indicate its meaning.

Let's examine each input and the corresponding output to look for the pattern:

1. Input: zup lug bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue blue red
   Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". ""Bluf"" appears and is followed by another ""blue"" in the output.

2. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   In this example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" is not followed by a direct output, and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" ""Bluf"" is followed by ""red"" in the output which is a repetition of the previous word.

3. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
   Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". After ""bluf,"" ""yellow"" is repeated.

4. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
   Output: red yellow yellow red green
   Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" After ""bluf,"" ""yellow"" is repeated.

5. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
   Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
   ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" Once again, ""bluf"" is followed by a repetition of ""yellow.""

From these examples, we observe that whenever ""bluf"" appears, the immediately preceding color word is repeated in the output. Therefore, we can deduce that:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" indicates a repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it.

Bluf -> meaning: Repeat the previous color word.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" results in repeating the color associated with the previously mentioned color word in the sequence multiple times. Looking closely at the correspondence between the inputs and outputs, we can deduce the following associations:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow

Now, examining the use of the word ""walm"":

1. In the first input where ""walm"" appears after ""wif"", ""red"" (the color associated with ""wif"") is repeated three times in the output. 
2. In the second input, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" twice, and both times ""red"" is repeated thrice in the output. 
3. In the third input, ""walm"" follows ""dax"", resulting in ""green"" being repeated thrice in the output.
4. In the fourth input, ""walm"" follows ""dax"", again resulting in ""green"" repeated thrice in the output.
5. In the fifth input, ""walm"" follows ""wif"", leading to ""red"" being repeated thrice, the same pattern as previously seen.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the color linked to the immediately preceding color word to be repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,19
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, the meaning of lug appears to be consistent, and lug translates directly to 'blue'.

Rule: lug translates to the color blue regardless of the context in which it is used.
Rule: dax -> green

Each occurrence of the word ""dax"" results in the word ""green"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to examine the relationship between the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Let's look at each instance where ""wif"" is used:

1. zup walm lug wif -> yellow yellow yellow blue red
2. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
3. lug wif          -> blue red
4. zup wif          -> yellow red
5. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Analyzing each line individually:

- In example 1, the ""wif"" comes after ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" and the output is ""red.""
- In example 2, ""wif"" follows ""zup"" (""yellow"") and precedes ""walm"" (""yellow""), but the output after ""wif"" is ""red.""
- In example 3, ""wif"" comes after ""lug"" (""blue"") and the output is ""red"" again.
- In example 4, ""wif"" follows ""zup"" (""yellow"") and the output is again ""red.""
- In example 5, the sequence ""dax wif"" translates to ""green red,"" and ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""

From these observations, we can determine that ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red"" regardless of the preceding words. Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following patterns for the nonce word ""bluf"" along with other words:

- ""wif"" appears to translate to ""red"".
- ""dax"" appears to translate to ""green"".
- ""zup"" appears to translate to ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" appears to translate to ""blue"".

Now let's analyze the usage of ""bluf"":

1. wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> red green red red yellow red
   Here, ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup"" and precedes ""wif"". ""wif"" translates to ""red"", and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""red"". All instances of ""wif"" are translated to ""red"", so this reinforces that ""bluf"" could also mean ""red"".

2. zup dax bluf zup dax -> yellow green green yellow green
   Here, ""bluf"" is the third word and is preceded by ""dax"" (green) and followed by ""zup"" (yellow); The color for ""bluf"" is ""green"", the same as the one that precedes it.

3. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
   Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and since ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", ""bluf"" also translates to ""yellow"".

4. zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue
   ""bluf"" is preceded and followed by ""zup"" (yellow) in the first occurrence and followed by ""lug"" (blue) in the second occurrence; the output for ""bluf"" in both cases is ""yellow"". 

5. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
   ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which translates to ""red"", and ""bluf"" also translates to ""red"".

From these observations, we can deduce a rule that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it. If there is no word before it, as in example 3, it defaults to ""yellow"", the color of ""zup"".

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the previous word; if there is no previous word, the color is yellow.
Based on the given examples, it is possible to deduce that the nonce word ""walm"" is associated with a repeated occurrence of the color that immediately precedes it. Let’s break down the examples provided:

1. In the first example, ""zup wif dax walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red green green green blue."" Here, ""dax"" represents ""green,"" and directly following ""walm,"" we see ""green"" repeated three times.

2. In the second example, ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" results in ""green blue blue blue green red red green."" The word ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with ""blue,"" followed by ""blue"" being repeated three times.

3. The third example is ""lug walm,"" which outputs ""blue blue blue."" There is no word before ""lug,"" and ""lug"" is repeated three times in the output, corresponding to ""blue.""

4. In the next example, ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" translates to ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow."" The word ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" and in the output, ""yellow"" is repeated three times following it.

5. Lastly, the example ""zup walm"" converts to ""yellow yellow yellow."" Again, ""zup"" is right before ""walm,"" and ""yellow"" is repeated three times in the output.

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word preceding walm three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug bluf wif
    ",Output: green blue blue red,green blue blue red,True,20
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, each instance of a word correlates to a specific color. Here is the correlation evidenced by the examples:

- ""wif"" = red
- ""bluf"" = red
- ""zup"" = yellow
- ""dax"" = green
- ""lug"" = blue

Thus, the rule seems to be that each nonce word corresponds to a unique color in English.

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Every occurrence of ""dax"" in the input is translated to ""green"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce a pattern for the nonce word ""wif"" and the corresponding output color ""red."" To understand the rule, let's look at the given inputs and outputs and see how ""wif"" affects the output each time:

- When the input is only ""wif,"" the output is solely ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" or ""zup,"" each of these words corresponds to additional outputs of ""red"" and ""yellow"" respectively, with the number of occurrences matching the number of times the word is in the input.
- When ""wif"" is preceded or followed by other words like ""dax"" or ""lug,"" it still results in ""red,"" but these other words also have their own color outputs: ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""blue"" for ""lug.""

From this analysis, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" corresponds directly to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it.

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be that it causes the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word. In each instance, the word before ""bluf"" has a corresponding color which is then repeated twice in the output. 

Here are the associations given in the examples:

- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" is associated with ""red.""
- ""dax"" is associated with ""green.""

And when these words are followed by ""bluf,"" the output is the corresponding color repeated twice:

- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
- ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow"" (Here, the rule applies to the word ""zup"" that comes right before ""bluf"")

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word twice.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should examine the outputs whenever the word ""walm"" appears in the input. By looking at all examples where ""walm"" is used, we can try to identify a pattern:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"". Since ""lug"" is not repeated in the output, we can presume ""walm"" may mean a repetition of the color word that precedes it.
  
- In the second example, ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" becomes ""green blue blue blue green red red green"". Observing the sequence, it appears that ""walm"" is again followed by a repetition of the previous color word, which is ""blue"" this time. However, the number of repetitions is three, not just a repeat of the preceding color. Also, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so the presence of ""dax"" after ""walm"" does not affect the sequence initiated by ""walm.""

- In the third example, ""dax walm wif dax"" translates to ""green green green red green"". Here ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (which corresponds to ""green"") and the output is a repetition of ""green"" two more times before the ""wif"" input changes the color to ""red"". The pattern of ""walm"" causing a triple repetition seems to hold.

- In the fourth example, ""dax walm"" simply translates to ""green green green"". ""Walm"" after ""dax"" again results in ""green"" being outputted three times.

- In the fifth example, ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue"". Following the pattern, ""walm"" after ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red"") causes ""red"" to be repeated three times total.

Given all of these examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""walm"" causes the color that precedes it to repeat twice more, making a sequence of that color three times in a row.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color word two additional times for a total of three occurrences.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,21
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to induce the meaning of ""lug"" as follows:

1. When ""lug"" appears alone, the output is ""blue"".
2. When ""lug"" is followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""blue blue"", suggesting that ""bluf"" also means ""blue"" or perhaps the repetition of ""lug"" results in the repetition of ""blue"".
3. The sequence ""lug wif lug wif lug"" results in ""blue red blue red blue"". This indicates that ""lug"" means ""blue"" and ""wif"" means ""red"".
4. Again, when ""lug"" appears alone, the output is ""blue"".
5. ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue"". It's not entirely clear what ""dax"" or ""walm"" means individually, but it seems that ""lug"" in this context also means ""blue"", and the presence of ""dax"" at the beginning results in the output starting with ""green"".

Given these observations, the rule can be inferred as:

Rule: ""lug"" means ""blue"". Its meaning seems to be consistent regardless of context in the given examples.
dax -> green

Rule: ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in each example given, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" Here are the translations for each of the inputs:

- Input: wif -> Output: red
- Input: dax wif walm -> Output: green red red red
- Input: dax zup walm wif walm -> Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
- Input: wif -> Output: red
- Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green

Given this information, it appears that each nonce word consistently maps to a specific color. Other words like ""dax"", ""zup"", ""walm"", ""lug"", and ""bluf"" all map to ""green,"" ""yellow,"" ""red,"" ""blue,"" and ""blue"" respectively. None of the mappings appear to be context-dependent, and they all result in the same color output despite the order in which they appear.

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> meaning. 

Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be that the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"". Each time ""zup"" is presented in the input, the output consistently includes the color ""yellow"" corresponding to its position.

Rule: ""zup"" means ""yellow"".
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a rule related to the color mentioned before it. Here is the rule induction based on the examples:

- If bluf follows a color, repeat that color:
  - Example: ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"".
  - Example: ""dax lug bluf"" translates to ""green blue blue"".

- If bluf follows a sequence of different things (including colors), repeat the last color mentioned:
  - Example: ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""green red yellow yellow red red red"".

However, there is an exception where ""bluf"" does not follow a color word. In the example ""zup bluf"", rather than repeating the color ""yellow"", it turns into ""yellow yellow"", which does not adhere to the above rule. This could be because there is no previous color word to ""bluf"" other than ""zup"" for ""yellow"". 

Based on this, the rule for what ""bluf"" means is not entirely clear because of the conflicting examples, so we'll attempt another interpretation:

If there is a ""lug,"" ""dax,"" or ""wif"" followed by a ""bluf"", the resulting color sequence is the color associated with the word just before ""bluf"" followed by another of the same color.

- Example: ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue"".
- Example: ""dax lug bluf"" results in ""green blue blue"".

From the conflicting example:
- Example: ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"".

Here's a potential revised induction:

Rule: bluf -> means ""repeat the previous color,"" or if there is no previous color given, repeat the color of the word that 'bluf' follows.

But, considering the exception found in ""zup bluf"", and assuming there are no errors in the examples, it seems that there might be an unaccounted variable influencing the outcome, or the examples do not provide enough information to deduce a consistent rule for ""bluf.""
Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following patterns:
- ""dax"" leads to the output ""green.""
- ""lug"" leads to the output ""blue.""
- ""wif"" leads to the output ""red.""
- ""zup"" leads to the output ""yellow.""

Whenever ""walm"" is present in the input, the output contains a sequence of ""green"" repeated either two or three times. This repetition does not occur with any other words in the examples. Additionally, it seems like the number of ""green"" outputs after ""walm"" corresponds to the number of words between ""walm"" and ""dax"" plus one.

Using this observed pattern, we can deduce the following rule for what ""walm"" means:

Rule: ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the word ""green"" in the output, correlating to the number of 'green'-associated words (in this case, ""dax"") following ""walm"" in the input, plus one.

Therefore, the rule is:

walm -> causes the next instance of the word ""green"" in the output to be repeated for each occurrence of ""dax"" that follows ""walm"" in the input sequence, plus one additional time.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax lug zup lug
    ",Output: blue green blue yellow blue,blue green blue yellow blue,True,22
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the word ""lug"" correlates consistently to the output ""blue."" The presence of ""lug"" in the input directly results in ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""lug"" within the input sequence. Furthermore, it does not appear to modify or interact with adjacent words, as those words (""wif,"" ""dax,"" ""zup,"" etc.) are translated into their respective color words without alteration, suggesting that ""lug"" represents a standalone concept or word rather than a rule that alters the meaning of adjacent words.

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following rules for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" and other words in the sequence:

1. When ""dax"" appears alone or the first in a sequence, the output is ""green.""
2. When ""dax"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output before ""dax"" changes to ""blue"" and ""dax"" remains ""green.""
3. When ""dax"" is followed by ""zup,"" the pattern ""green yellow"" emerges. If the sequence ""dax zup"" is repeated, the pattern also repeats.
4. When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""green green,"" regardless of the number of times ""walm"" appears after ""dax.""
5. When ""wif"" appears at the end of a sequence, the output is ""red.""

Therefore, we can deduce:

dax -> green

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in output; however, adjacent words can modify preceding or following colors in the sequence according to their respective rules.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" translates to ""red."" Every time the word ""wif"" is included in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding output. 

Here is the pattern observed:

- The input ""zup dax wif"" yields the output ""yellow green red."" ""Wif"" is the last word, and ""red"" is the last color.
- The input ""wif lug"" yields the output ""red blue."" ""Wif"" is the first word, and ""red"" is the first color.
- In the input ""dax bluf wif lug zup,"" the sequence ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the output sequence ""green green red blue yellow.""
- The input ""wif bluf"" yields the output ""red red."" ""Wif"" is the first word correlating with the first instance of ""red.""
- Finally, the input ""wif lug walm"" results in ""red blue blue blue."" Here again, ""wif"" aligns with ""red.""

Therefore, we can confidently establish the meaning as:

Rule: wif -> red.
Given the provided examples, it seems that each word corresponds to a color output. The word ""zup"" consistently results in the output ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words that surround it. Therefore, the rule for the word ""zup"" is as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the colors in the output each time ""bluf"" is mentioned in the input:

1. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

2. Input: zup dax bluf zup dax
   Output: yellow green green yellow green
   ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""

3. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow
   ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

4. Input: wif lug bluf
   Output: red blue blue
   ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""

5. Input: wif bluf dax lug
   Output: red red green blue
   ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

From these examples, we can induce that ""bluf"" takes on the color immediately before it except when it's the first occurrence where ""bluf"" defaults to ""red"".

So the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> If ""bluf"" is not the first color mentioned, it takes the color of the immediately preceding color word in the input sequence; if ""bluf"" is the first color word, it defaults to ""red"".
walm -> rule. Rule: The word walm causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word that directly precedes it the same number of times as the number of letters in walm. For example, wif walm leads to ""red red red yellow"" because wif corresponds to red, and walm has four letters, so red is repeated three times before adding yellow for walm. Similarly, dax walm leads to ""green green green"" because dax corresponds to green, and walm has four letters, so green is repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug wif
    ","Based on the established rules, we need to translate the input ""wif lug wif"" into the corresponding color outputs:

Input: wif lug wif

- The first ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- The second ""wif,"" appearing at the end of a sequence, corresponds to ""red.""

Therefore, the output will be ""red blue red.""

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each unique word following ""lug"" corresponds to a unique color in the output. The examples show a one-to-one mapping where the nonce word ""lug"" appears to be a command or function that translates the subsequent words into colors. Here's the mapping that can be inferred:

- ""lug dax"" results in ""blue green,"" meaning that when ""dax"" follows ""lug,"" it translates to ""green.""
- ""lug zup"" is not directly shown, but ""dax zup"" gives ""green yellow,"" hence ""zup"" is consistent with ""yellow"" when it follows ""lug.""
- ""lug wif"" translates to ""blue red,"" implying that ""wif"" after ""lug"" represents ""red.""

Also, when ""lug"" is alone, it translates to ""blue."" It's not clear what the standalone word ""lug"" represents since there is no context outside of its presence. However, in the context of these examples, ""lug"" by itself translates to the color blue.

The consistent pattern from the examples indicates that when ""lug"" is used before another word, the following word is translated into color based on some predefined mapping. The word ""lug"" seems to signify the start of a color translation sequence where it itself is ""blue,"" and it affects the color mapping of the word that immediately follows it.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: ""lug"" acts as a function to translate the immediately following word into a specific color. When ""lug"" is standalone, it represents the color blue. Each unique word following ""lug"" is associated with a distinct color:
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""lug"" by itself -> blue
Based on the examples provided, we can infer that each word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence. In every instance where ""dax"" is included in the input, ""green"" is included in the output.

Therefore, we can deduce the following:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
Rule: zup -> yellow

Each occurrence of ""zup"" in the examples corresponds directly to the word ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of context or position within the sequence. Therefore, ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
Rule: 'bluf' translates to 'red'.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can examine the patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs, focusing on where ""walm"" appears:

1. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the pattern is:
   - ""wif"" -> red
   - ""walm"" -> red red
   Consequently, ""walm"" doubles the color associated with the preceding word.

2. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the pattern is:
   - ""lug"" -> blue
   - ""walm"" -> blue blue
   Again, ""walm"" appears to double the color associated with the preceding word.

3. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the pattern is:
   - ""dax"" -> green
   - ""walm"" -> red
   This does not follow the pattern of doubling the preceding color, thus we must consider other entries for more insight.

4. When ""walm"" is the only word after ""lug,"" the pattern is:
   - ""lug"" -> blue
   - ""walm"" -> blue blue blue
   Here, ""walm"" triples the color associated with the preceding word.

5. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the pattern is:
   - ""zup"" -> yellow
   - ""walm"" -> yellow yellow
   ""Walm"" doubles the color associated with the preceding word.

Taking these observations into account, it seems that the term ""walm"" functions as an amplifier of the color associated with the preceding word. Whenever ""walm"" follows a word, it extends the sequence of the color associated with that word.

However, one inconsistency is found in the input ""wif walm dax"":
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""walm"" -> red red
- ""dax"" -> green
Despite ""walm"" followed by ""dax"", ""green"" appears only once, which prevents us from concluding a clear rule. Assuming that we follow the closest consistency in patterns, we may still generalize a rule for the meaning of ""walm.""

Rule: ""walm"" -> A repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, typically doubling or tripling it. If this generalization holds true, the anomaly with the input ""wif walm dax"" would likely be an exception or a mistake in the pattern.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,24
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the translations for ""walm"", ""dax"", ""bluf"", ""wif"", and ""zup"" seem consistent within the given context:

- ""walm"" consistently translates to ""green"".
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"".
- ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""green"".
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"".
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"".

Given that ""lug"" appears to always translate to ""blue"", regardless of its position or the surrounding context, we can deduce:

lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in every presented context.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we can analyze the correspondence between the input sequences and the output sequences in the examples. We'll look for patterns that can help us figure out the rule governing the association of ""dax"" to a particular output.

First, we examine when ""dax"" occurs in the input and what the corresponding output is:

1. dax bluf zup bluf dax -> green green yellow yellow green
2. lug zup dax wif -> blue yellow green red
3. zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
4. wif dax wif -> red green red
5. dax wif lug -> green red blue

One immediate observation is that whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""green."" The color that is linked to ""dax"" does not change with context—it is consistently ""green,"" regardless of the surrounding words.

Additionally, looking at the colors associated with the other words, we can notice that they do not appear to repeat a pattern in association with “dax.” For example, ""wif"" is associated with ""red"" even when adjacent to ""dax,"" which means the meaning of ""dax"" does not depend on what comes before or after it.

Based on these examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
zup -> yellow. 

Rule: The word 'zup' consistently corresponds to the color yellow in every example provided.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the nonce word ""bluf"" means to repeat the word that directly precedes it. Hence, when ""bluf"" follows a color word like ""lug,"" ""wif,"" or ""dax,"" which stand for ""blue,"" ""red,"" and ""green"" respectively, the output is that color word repeated twice. 

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the preceding word
Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times. 

- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" which suggests that the color associated with ""dax"" is green.
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which suggests that the color associated with ""zup"" is yellow.
- ""lug walm zup wif"" leads to ""blue blue blue yellow red,"" indicating that ""lug"" is associated with blue, and the sequence following ""lug walm"" reverts back to the pattern without repetition.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax lug dax
    ",Output: yellow green blue green,yellow green blue green,True,25
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the given examples. Every instance of ""lug"" in the input is replaced with ""blue"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine its appearances and the corresponding output colors:

1. In the first example, ""dax bluf wif"" corresponds to ""green green red"". Since ""bluf"" corresponds to green and ""wif"" to red, it appears that ""dax"" also corresponds to green. The sequence is ""dax (green), bluf (green), wif (red)"".

2. In the second example, ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green"". Here ""walm"" corresponds to green, and since there is no other color indicated, it can be deduced that ""dax"" must also correspond to green. The sequence is ""dax (green), walm (green)"".

3. In the third example, ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green"". Since we know ""walm"" corresponds to yellow and green in different contexts, ""wif"" to red, and ""lug"" to blue or yellow depending on context, we see that ""dax"" is once again corresponding to green. The sequence includes ""dax (green)"" at the end.

4. In the fourth example, ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red red green blue blue"". ""Lug"" corresponds to both blue and yellow, ""wif"" to red, and ""bluf"" to green. Thus, when ""dax"" appears, it corresponds to green. The sequence is ""lug (blue), wif (red), bluf (red), dax (green), lug (blue), bluf (blue)"".

5. The fifth example, ""zup lug dax lug"" corresponds to ""yellow blue green blue"". Here, ""lug"" again shows variability, corresponding to blue and yellow, while ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. ""Dax"" corresponds to green. The sequence is ""zup (yellow), lug (blue), dax (green), lug (blue)"".

Based on these examples, it appears that the rule of ""dax"" is that it consistently corresponds to the color green regardless of the context in which it appears.

Rule: dax -> corresponds to the color green.
From the examples provided, it can be seen that every occurrence of ""wif"" is translated to ""red"". Here's the breakdown:

Input: wif dax
Output: red green
- ""wif"" appears first and is translated to ""red"".

Input: dax zup lug wif zup
Output: green yellow blue red yellow
- ""wif"" appears after ""lug"" and is translated to ""red"".

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red
- ""wif"" is at the end and is translated to ""red"".

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue
- ""wif"" appears before ""lug"" and is translated to ""red"".

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red
- ""wif"" appears after ""zup"" and is translated to ""red"".

Regardless of position in the sentence or the words around it, ""wif"" consistently maps to the color ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Each occurrence of ""zup"" in the examples translates to ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the correlation between the input and output in each example. Let's examine the constant elements and their corresponding outputs.

Firstly, ""bluf"" is present in every input example, and the last word of each output is ""blue"" or ""red"", which suggests that ""bluf"" is likely to correlate with these two colors. Let's break it down:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug wif"" (blue red), the output is ""blue.""
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax lug wif"" (green blue red), the output is ""red.""
3. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif zup dax"" (red yellow green), the output is ""green.""
4. When only ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" (green), the output is ""green.""
5. When ""bluf"" is following ""wif"" after a sequence (red), the output is again ""red.""

From these observations, we can infer the likely rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" represents a repeating color—it repeats the last mentioned color in the sequence.

Applying the rule to the examples:

1. lug (blue) wif (red) lug (blue) bluf -> The last color mentioned is ""blue,"" so bluf becomes ""blue.""
2. dax (green) lug (blue) wif (red) bluf -> The last color mentioned is ""red,"" so bluf becomes ""red.""
3. wif (red) zup (yellow) dax (green) bluf -> The last color mentioned is ""green,"" so bluf becomes ""green.""
4. dax (green) bluf -> The last color mentioned is ""green,"" so bluf becomes ""green.""
5. zup (yellow) lug (blue) zup (yellow) walm (yellow) dax (green) wif (red) bluf -> The last color mentioned is ""red,"" so bluf becomes ""red.""

Therefore the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> repeats the last mentioned color in the sequence.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", let's examine the outputs in correspondence to their inputs where ""walm"" is present:

1. Input: ... wif walm lug wif
   Output: ... red red blue red

2. Input: ... lug walm dax ...
   Output: ... blue blue green ...

3. Input: ... dax walm wif
   Output: ... green green red

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

In each of these examples, the presence of ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color directly previous to it. More specifically, ""walm"" seems to create a duplicate of the previous color mentioned:

1. ""wif walm"" results in ""red red"", duplicating ""red""
2. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue"", duplicating ""blue""
3. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green"", duplicating ""green""

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: walm -> causes the duplication of the previous color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,26
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" it will be helpful to see how it interacts with the other words in the examples. Let's analyze each instance:

1. ""dax walm wif"" results in ""green green green red."" Here, ""dax"" leads to ""green.""

2. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" results in ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" Again, ""dax"" corresponds with ""green.""

3. ""lug dax lug"" results in ""blue green blue."" Here, ""dax"" again corresponds with ""green.""

4. ""zup dax bluf"" results in ""yellow green green."" Once more, ""dax"" corresponds with ""green.""

5. ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue."" ""Dax"" represents ""green,"" while ""walm"" produces two instances of ""blue.""

Each appearance of ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green,"" regardless of the context or the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence. There is a consistent one-to-one mapping between ""dax"" and ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
Analyzing the given examples and their corresponding outputs, the rule for what ""wif"" means appears to be consistent across all examples. In every instance, the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" 

Here is how the rule applies to each example:

- In the first example, ""lug zup wif"" translates to ""blue yellow red,"" with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" translates to ""red green yellow red green green,"" with both instances of ""wif"" corresponding to ""red.""
- In the third example, ""dax wif"" translates to ""green red,"" with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red,"" with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax bluf wif lug"" translates to ""green green red blue,"" with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red.""

Based on these observations, the rule is quite direct:
Rule: wif -> red
From the given examples, it seems that each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output. Here are the apparent mappings from the examples:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" (as noticed in the third input example where ""wif walm zup"" leads to ""red red red yellow"", indicating ""wif"" and ""walm"" both correspond to ""red"")

Now, let's deduce the meaning of ""zup"":

1. In the first example, when ""zup"" is between two ""wif"" words, the output sequence is ""red green yellow red"". Since we know ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""dax"" is not present, ""zup"" must correspond to ""yellow"".

2. The second example solidifies this as ""zup wif"" outputs ""yellow red"" and we already know ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

3. The third example also supports this, as ""zup"" is the last word and ""yellow"" is the last color in the output.

4. In the fourth example, ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow"", and since ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", it once again supports that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".

5. Lastly, the fifth example has a sequence of different words that correspond to different colors and ends with ""zup"". The output sequence follows the known color translations and ends with ""yellow"", once again indicating that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

So based on these observations, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule: bluf -> repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. If bluf immediately succeeds a word, it takes on the color that word represents. For example:

- ""dax zup bluf"" results in ""green yellow yellow"" because zup corresponds to yellow, and bluf repeats this color.
- ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue"" because lug corresponds to blue and bluf repeats this color.
- ""zup bluf lug"" results in ""yellow yellow blue"" because zup corresponds to yellow, bluf repeats this color, and lug corresponds to blue.
- ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" results in ""red red green green red red red blue red""; each bluf repeats the color of the word before it (wif -> red, dax -> green).
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" consistently generates output that matches the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, and it does so three times. Here is a breakdown of the observed pattern:

- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (lug zup dax walm), the output is ""green"" three times, which is the color associated with ""lug"" (blue yellow green green green).
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (zup bluf wif walm), the output is ""yellow"" three times, which is the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow yellow red red red).
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (dax walm), the output is ""green"" three times, again matching the color associated with ""dax"" (green green green).

Thus, the meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup
    ",Output: blue yellow,blue yellow,True,27
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" seems to correspond to the color ""blue."" When observing how ""lug"" impacts the resulting sequence of colors in the output, it does not appear to modify or change the sequence or colors represented by other words; it simply adds ""blue"" to the sequence.

Here is the breakdown:

1. ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue,"" where the ""lug"" corresponds to the last color ""blue.""
2. ""wif zup bluf lug"" translates to ""red yellow yellow blue,"" again with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue.""
3. ""wif lug dax"" translates to ""red blue green,"" with ""lug"" being ""blue.""
4. ""lug walm wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue red,"" with the first ""blue"" corresponding to ""lug.""
5. ""lug wif"" translates to ""blue red,"" with ""lug"" being the first ""blue.""

From the above observations, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" by looking at the patterns of input and output sequences.

- In the first example, when ""dax"" appears between ""zup wif"" and ""wif bluf"", the sequence of outputs are ""yellow red green red red"".

- In the second example, ""dax"" appears after ""lug zup"" and is followed by ""walm"". The outputs are ""blue yellow green green green"".

- The third example has three instances of ""dax"" and shows a pattern where ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" corresponds to ""green blue blue blue green red red green"".

- The fourth example includes ""dax"" twice in different contexts: ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup"". The output for this is ""yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow"".

- In the final example, ""dax"" is used both at the beginning and in the middle of the sequence: ""dax lug dax lug wif"". The output is ""green blue green blue red"".

By examining the patterns, we can see that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position or the surrounding words. So, it seems that ""dax"" is used to represent the color green in each context it is used.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence. The rule is thus:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we must look for patterns in the provided examples:

1. Example: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   Here, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" and before ""zup,"" resulting in two instances of the color yellow, followed by ""lug"" which corresponds to blue. ""Bluf"" appears to be linked to the color yellow followed by blue.

2. Example: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
   Output: red green red red yellow red
   ""Bluf"" is followed by ""zup,"" and after ""bluf"" there is the color yellow. This is consistent with the first example.

3. Example: dax lug bluf wif
   Output: green blue blue red
   ""Bluf"" precedes ""wif"" and produces blue followed by red. This is different from the first two examples, suggesting that the word after ""bluf"" changes its output.

4. Example: zup wif bluf zup
   Output: yellow red red yellow
   Here, ""bluf"" is between ""wif"" and ""zup,"" giving us red followed by yellow. This example does not fully align with the previous ones.

5. Example: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
   Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
   ""Bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" resulting in the color green, followed by blue. This aligns with the first example where following ""bluf"" with ""lug"" also resulted in blue. When ""bluf"" precedes a noun, it results in the color normally associated with that noun followed by blue.

From these examples, it seems ""bluf"" causes a repetition of the color corresponding to the subsequent word and is then followed by the color blue. Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to mean that we should repeat the color associated with the next word and then add blue.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color corresponding to the next word and follow with blue.
Based on the provided examples, walm appears to generate multiple instances of the color red in the output with one exception where it follows the word 'lug'. To deduce the rule for walm, let's look at where it appears and what follows or comes before it:

1. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red (walm gives three reds)
2. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue (walm gives three reds before lug, which is blue)
3. lug walm wif lug -> blue blue blue red blue (walm follows a lug and only one red appears)
4. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue (walm follows lug and there are no reds; instead, there are blue outputs)
5. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red (walm gives three reds)

Notice that whenever walm is used, except when following 'lug', it is associated with three reds in output. Following 'lug', the pattern changes and does not produce three reds. It seems that 'lug' changes the effect walm has on the output.

The rule could be as follows:

Rule: When walm is used, output three reds (red red red), unless it directly follows the word 'lug', in which case the pattern is broken, and walm does not output three reds.


    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,28
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue

Each occurrence of the word ""lug"" in the input consistently corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position or the presence of other words in the input string.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" correlates with the color green. In every instance where ""dax"" appears, the output includes the color green.

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" is used in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the relationship between the input words and the output colors. Here's how the given inputs translate to outputs:

- Each instance of ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green.""
- Each instance of ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow.""
- Each standalone instance of ""wif"" or when it appears in sequence with other words is associated with the color ""red.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word zup seems to function by repeating the color associated with the word that follows it, equal to the number of syllables in that following word. Let's examine each case:

1. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   - ""Bluf"" presumably corresponds to yellow, and since it is a one-syllable word, yellow is repeated once.

2. Input: lug walm zup walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""Walm"" seemingly corresponds to yellow, which is a one-syllable word, so yellow is repeated once. However, since it follows ""zup,"" it is repeated three times, matching ""walm"" which appears three times after ""zup.""

3. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   - ""Walm"" once again dictates the color yellow and is a one-syllable word, hence it is repeated once normally. But following ""zup,"" it is repeated three times.

4. Input: lug zup dax lug dax
   Output: blue yellow green blue green
   - ""Dax"" corresponds to green, a one-syllable word, so following ""zup,"" green is repeated once.

5. Input: dax wif zup dax
   Output: green red yellow green
   - As before, since ""dax"" correlates with green and is one syllable in length, ""zup"" causes it to be repeated once.

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule for the nonce word ""zup"":

Rule: zup -> Repeat the color corresponding to the following word, with the number of repetitions being the number of syllables in that following word.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns in the given examples. Specifically, we can look at what output is generated whenever ""bluf"" is used in the input. 

Looking at the examples:

1. ""wif bluf dax"" -> ""red red green""
2. ""dax bluf lug wif"" -> ""green green blue red""
3. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
4. ""lug zup bluf dax"" -> ""blue yellow yellow green""
5. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""

In every instance where ""bluf"" appears, the output word before ""bluf"" is repeated. In the sequence where it's used alone (""dax bluf""), the output for ""dax"" (""green"") is simply repeated. This suggests that ""bluf"" operates as a repetition indicator for the output that corresponds to the word prior to ""bluf"".

Rule: bluf -> causes the previous color to be repeated in the output.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" is associated with the repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it. Let's look at how ""walm"" works in these examples step by step:

1. dax walm -> ""green green green""
   - Here, ""walm"" causes the color ""green"" (associated with ""dax"") to be repeated three times.

2. lug walm zup -> ""blue blue blue yellow""
   - ""Walm"" follows the word ""lug,"" which corresponds to the color ""blue,"" so ""blue"" is repeated three times. ""Zup"" follows, which corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

3. dax walm zup walm -> ""green green green yellow yellow yellow""
   - Again, ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in ""green"" repeated three times. The word ""zup"" introduces ""yellow,"" and another ""walm"" makes ""yellow"" repeat three times.

4. wif zup walm dax zup -> ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow""
   - Here ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" followed by ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" Then we see ""walm,"" which causes ""yellow"" to repeat two more times, giving us three ""yellow"" in a row. The pattern continues with ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" followed by ""zup"" with a ""yellow.""

5. lug zup walm lug -> ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue""
   - The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" followed by ""zup"" which is ""yellow."" ""Walm"" makes ""yellow"" repeat three times in total, followed by another ""lug"" resulting in ""blue.""

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated two more times (three times in total).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, ""lug"" seems to be coded as ""blue."" When ""lug"" appears alone or with other non-coded words such as ""walm"" or ""dax,"" the output is consistent with ""blue"" being repeated for each instance of a non-coded word, and ""green"" for ""dax,"" no matter the order.

Here are the deductions made from the examples:

- ""lug"" always results in ""blue"" when it appears, regardless of its position.
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" implying ""walm"" is represented by two additional ""blue"" colors.
- ""lug dax"" results in ""blue green green,"" so ""dax"" seems to be represented by ""green,"" with an extra ""green"" following it, similar to ""walm"" with ""blue.""

From these observations, one could surmise that ""lug"" serves as an initiator for a sequence of colors, with ""lug"" itself being ""blue"" and causing the word immediately following it to be represented by a specific color repeated. However, there are not enough contrasting examples with different words following ""lug"" to fully determine a pattern for how other words are coded, aside from ""dax"" leading to ""green.""

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and may initiate a sequence where the following word has its corresponding color repeated.

Consequently: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples provided, whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
Rule: wif -> red

Based on the examples provided, each unique word corresponds to a color. The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in every example. Therefore, the rule is that ""wif"" means ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow' regardless of its position in the input sequence.
From the given examples, it looks like the word ""bluf"" translates into a color. The specific color it represents depends on the word appearing directly before it. Let's analyze the patterns:

1. ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue""
2. ""bluf"" on its own after ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
3. ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red""
4. ""bluf dax lug bluf"" translates to ""green blue blue"" where ""dax lug bluf"" translates to ""green blue""
5. ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red""

Based on these outputs, we can deduce that ""bluf"" represents a repetition of the last color word that appears before it. Therefore, ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" repeats this color. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it outputs ""yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" repeats ""yellow.""

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Replication of the color word that precedes it. If no color word precedes it, and it follows ""zup,"" it defaults to ""yellow.""
Rule: The word ""walm"" prompts a repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word, one additional time than it has been repeated already.

Explanation: ""walm"" follows a word whose associated color is then output with one additional occurrence. For instance:
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" where ""green"" is the color for ""dax,"" and it is repeated three times instead of the two times we would expect from just ""dax.""
- ""lug zup dax walm"" gives us ""blue yellow green green green,"" which shows the ""green"" for ""dax"" and then ""green"" repeated for ""walm"" an additional time.
- ""zup wif lug zup walm"" results in ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""yellow"" for ""zup"" is repeated once more due to ""walm.""

So in summary:
walm -> Causes the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word, one more time than it has been repeated already.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Based on the provided examples, every instance of the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue.""
Based on the provided examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" can be consistently replaced with the color ""green."" There are no examples where ""dax"" translates to anything other than ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the outputs. Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the output is ""red."" Other words such as ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug"" correspond to other colors.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: Each occurrence of the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to identify the pattern that dictates what ""bluf"" means in each context. Here's what we know:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the output is ""yellow green green"".
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", which occurs twice, the output is ""blue blue"".
3. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", which occurs four times, the output is ""red red"".

Although the provided data is limited, there appears to be a pattern that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word that precedes it, repeating it twice in the output. To frame this as a rule:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" represents a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

Therefore, we can express the meaning of ""bluf"" as follows: 

bluf -> Repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, doubling it in the output sequence.
Based on the examples provided, each walm translates to a repetition of the color immediately before it three times. Here's the breakdown according to the input/output pairs:

1. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""walm"" translates to a repetition of blue three times.

2. zup lug walm wif dax -> yellow blue blue blue red green
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""walm"" repeats blue three times.
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""

3. wif walm dax -> red red red green
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- ""walm"" repeats red three times.
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""

4. lug zup dax walm -> blue yellow green green green
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""walm"" repeats green three times.

5. wif walm lug bluf -> red red red blue blue
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- ""walm"" repeats red three times.
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""bluf"" is a new word, but since it's after a ""blue,"" and contains similar letters, it can be inferred that it translates to ""blue"" as well.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce a pattern for determining the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"". Let's analyze the instances it's used in and compare the output.

1. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". Since ""walm"" is repeated three times and the output is ""blue blue blue"", ""walm"" likely means ""blue"", and ""lug"" then corresponds to the first ""blue"" in the output.

2. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   - ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green"", and ""walm"" to ""green green green"" in this sequence. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". After ""wif"" there is ""lug"", which again corresponds to ""blue"".

3. Input: lug
   Output: blue
   - With just ""lug"" in the input, the output is ""blue"". This reinforces the idea that ""lug"" means ""blue"".

4. Input: wif dax lug
   Output: red green blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green"". ""lug"" follows as ""blue"".

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   - ""wif"" is ""red"", ""zup"" and ""bluf"" each correspond to ""yellow"". ""lug"" follows as ""blue"". Then ""walm"" is ""blue"", ""dax"" is ""green"", and ""lug"" again is ""blue"".

In each instance, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, the rule for ""dax"" seems to be related to the color it is translated into in the output. Across all examples, whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" is present in the output at the corresponding position. 

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the meaning of the word ""wif"" by observing the pattern of the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Here's the breakdown:

1. ""dax zup wif"" -> ""green yellow red""
2. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
3. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" -> ""blue red yellow red red red""
4. ""dax wif lug"" -> ""green red blue""
5. ""wif walm zup"" -> ""red red red yellow""

From these examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output in the same position. There is no apparent change in meaning when the context of ""wif"" changes, which suggests its meaning is not context-dependent within the given examples.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" is consistently replaced with the color ""yellow"" in all given contexts.
Rule: bluf -> blue
walm -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" seems to influence the output in the following way:

- Regardless of its position in the input string, whenever ""walm"" is present, the output is a series of reds, except for when the preceding word is ""dax"" or ""lug."" 

Here is the breakdown:

1. In the first example, ""wif walm dax zup"" leads to ""red red red green yellow,"" where ""walm"" is followed by two reds and then the colors for ""dax"" and ""zup"" as if it has the property to turn the following words red but doesn't affect ""dax"" (which is green).

2. In the second example, ""dax lug wif walm"" leads to ""green blue red red red,"" where ""walm"" is at the end and everything after ""dax lug"" turns red, indicating that ""walm"" again has the property to turn the following words to red, but since it's the last word, we only see its own color (which seems to be inherently red).

3. The third example, ""dax lug walm,"" which leads to ""green blue blue blue"" differs in that ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is blue instead of red. This suggests that the word preceding ""walm"" affects the color output.

4. In the fourth example, ""dax wif walm"" translates to ""green red red red,"" which is in line with the previous rule observed, where the influence of ""walm"" turns the subsequent color to red unless it follows ""dax.""

5. In the last example, ""lug zup walm lug"" results in ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" This suggests that when ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" it does not result in reds, but in yellows, which aligns with the idea that the word immediately before ""walm"" affects its output color.

Rule: ""walm"" turns the following colors red unless it is directly preceded by ""dax"" or ""lug,"" in which case the output color is blue for ""dax"" and yellow for ""lug."" However, since we've only seen ""walm"" be the last word once, if we take that as its inherent color, then it suggests ""walm"" is inherently red, but can be overridden by specific preceding words.


    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" in the input corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax"", let us look for patterns in each example.

1. ""dax walm wif walm"" generates an output of ""green green green red red red."" Since ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" and the repeated word ""walm"" twice generates a pattern change that ultimately results in ""red"", this suggests ""dax"" is associated with green and possibly serves as a reset or start point.

2. The single input ""dax"" yields an output of ""green,"" reinforcing that ""dax"" correlates directly with ""green"".

3. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" gives the output ""yellow blue blue blue red green."" The last word ""dax"" again aligns with the last color ""green."" Previous words correlate with their respective colors, with ""dax"" not altering the pattern of those words but instead, adding ""green"" to the end.

4. ""lug dax"" leads to the output ""blue green."" Here, ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green"".

5. For the input ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug,"" the corresponding output is ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue."" When ""dax"" follows ""zup,"" it seems as if ""zup"" has no impact on the color corresponding to ""dax,"" which remains ""green.""

From these observations, the rule for ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in all instances, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.

Therefore:

dax -> meaning: ""green""
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"". There is no variation in the output corresponding to ""wif"" despite the presence or absence of other words or their order. Hence, we can deduce that the word ""wif"" is equivalent to the color red. 

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" seems consistent in each example. Regardless of its position in the input, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Therefore, the rule appears to be quite straightforward:

zup -> ""yellow""

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output, irrespective of its position in the input sequence.
bluf -> the word that came before it. 

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes it, translating the preceding word's name into its respective color. If ""wif"" means ""red,"" then ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red."" If ""lug"" means ""blue,"" then ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" and if ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" then ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow."" The color for ""dax"" is ""green,"" so ""dax lug bluf dax"" becomes ""green blue blue green,"" with ""bluf"" taking the color of the word right before it, which is ""lug,"" and ""lug"" signifies ""blue.""
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for a pattern or rule in the given examples. Let's analyze and compare the input sequences with their corresponding output sequences:

1. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

   Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" and translates to ""blue green,"" while ""dax"" elsewhere corresponds to just ""green.""

2. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

   ""Walm"" comes after ""dax"" and yields ""green green"" while ""dax"" on its own corresponds to ""green.""

3. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

   ""Walm"" is following ""zup"" and translates to ""yellow yellow,"" with ""zup"" elsewhere matching to ""yellow.""

4. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

   Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and results in ""yellow yellow,"" similar to example 3.

5. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red

   ""Walm"" follows both ""lug"" and ""wif,"" and in both cases, outputs an additional ""blue"" or ""red"" respectively.

Based on the data gathered, ""walm"" doubles the output color of the word that precedes it. If ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green,"" we get ""green green."" If it follows ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" we get ""yellow yellow."" When it follows ""lug"" or ""wif,"" which correspond to ""blue"" and ""red"" respectively, it doubles the output of those colors too.

Rule: walm -> doubles the color output of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Each unique word in the input is associated with a specific color in the output. Based on the examples given, whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the respective position in the output.
Based on the patterns provided in the examples, the word ""dax"" seems to consistently correspond to the color green. The other words ""zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""lug bluf"" respectively correspond to the colors yellow, red, and blue blue. The term ""dax"" does not appear to change its output based on its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule seems straightforward:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that each unique word corresponds to a unique color. For instance, ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The word ""wif"" appears in every input and is followed by a different word each time, but in all outputs, ""wif"" is followed by the color ""red."" Therefore, we can conclude that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Analyzing the input-output pairs, it looks like each word (wif, dax, bluf, walm, lug, zup) correlates to a color in the output. We can begin by associating the known inputs with their respective outputs:

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- bluf -> green
- walm -> red (but appearing twice in a row changes the output to yellow following the occurrence of red)
- lug -> blue

Since there's consistency with these correlations across the examples, we can see that ""zup"" also translates to a color in the output. Noticing the pattern, whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""zup"" can be formulated as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" translates to ""red."" It seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to a color, with that color being specifically ""red."" However, we also notice that after ""bluf"" is used, the next word's color is repeated. It does not matter if the word ""bluf"" is in the beginning, middle, or end of the sequence; the repetition effect takes place.

Here are the specifics from the given examples:

- ""wif bluf"" resulted in ""red red,"" which suggests that ""wif"" means ""red"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that directly follows it or repeats its own color if no word follows.
- ""zup wif bluf"" resulted in ""yellow red red,"" which suggests ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""wif,"" which is ""red.""
- ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" resulted in ""green green red yellow green."" Here, ""dax"" means ""green,"" and ""bluf"" precedes ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" thus ""bluf"" again seems to repeat the color of the word following it.
- ""dax zup bluf"" resulted in ""green yellow yellow,"" where ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""zup.""
- ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" resulted in ""blue blue red blue red red red blue."" ""lug"" means ""blue,"" ""bluf"" again repeats the color of the following word ""wif"" which is ""red,"" and then ""wif"" repeats as ""red"" following ""bluf."" The word ""walm"" does not have a corresponding color, but its presence exists to show that ""wif"" keeps repeating as ""red"" after ""bluf.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red"" and causes the color of the next color word to be repeated. If it is the last color word, ""bluf"" repeats its own color ""red.""
Based on the given examples, ""walm"" seems to make the subsequent color words repeat their corresponding color output. Here's how it can be deduced from the examples:

Input: lug dax walm
Output: blue green green green
Explanation: ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""dax"" to green, and after ""walm,"" ""green"" repeats three times.

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
Explanation: ""wif"" corresponds to red, and after ""walm,"" ""red"" repeats three times, followed by ""dax"" corresponding to green.

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red
Explanation: ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" to red, and after ""walm,"" ""red"" repeats three times.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
Explanation: ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and after ""walm,"" ""yellow"" repeats three times.

Input: zup walm dax lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
Explanation: ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and after ""walm,"" ""yellow"" repeats three times followed by ""dax"" (green) and ""lug"" (blue).

Rule: walm -> causes the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it to repeat three times in the output. If there are words after ""walm,"" they follow in the output with their corresponding color without repetition.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"". Each time ""lug"" is provided in the input, the term ""blue"" appears in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue. Meaning: ""lug"" means ""blue"".
dax -> green

Rule: Every time the nonce word 'dax' is mentioned in the input, the output is 'green'.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the rules for the word ""wif"" and its corresponding output:

1. In the first example, ""zup lug walm wif walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue red red red"". In this case, ""walm"" appears twice after ""wif"", and the color sequence is ""blue red red red"", suggesting that ""wif"" results in a ""red"" for itself and an additional ""red"" for each ""walm"" that follows.

2. In the second example, ""wif lug"" leads to ""red blue"". This further supports that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". 

3. The third example, ""wif zup lug wif"", turns into ""red yellow blue red"". Here, ""wif"" appears at both the beginning and the end, each time resulting in ""red"".

4. In the fourth example, ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" converts to ""yellow yellow red blue green"". Again, ""wif"" translates to ""red"".

5. The fifth example, ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"", becomes ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red"". Regardless of the word that follows, ""wif"" consistently results in ""red"".

Thus, the rule for the word ""wif"" seems to be a straightforward translation:

Rule: wif -> red

Meaning: ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"", independent of context.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Each instance of the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the output.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look for a pattern across the examples provided:

1. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
2. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
3. wif dax bluf -> red green green
4. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
5. wif bluf lug dax wif -> red red blue green red

Since ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to ""green"" when it follows ""dax,"" but a different color when it does not follow ""dax"" or is not followed by ""zup,"" it appears that ""bluf"" is contextually dependent on the words around it. Additionally, ""bluf"" does not have the same color output across different inputs, so it is not a direct substitution for a particular color.

Looking at the last example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" but this is likely because of the surrounding words and not because ""bluf"" itself means ""red"" (since it has been ""green"" in other contexts).

A possible rule is that ""bluf"" takes on a color based on some rule regarding its position relative to other specific words. The pattern is not entirely clear with the given data, but it seems that ""bluf"" does not have a consistent meaning independently and its output color changes based on its context. 

Based on these observations, a tentative rule could be:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" is context-dependent, specifically influenced by the words that come directly before and/or after it. 

""bluf"" -> meaning. Meaning is context-dependent and is influenced by surrounding words according to an unspecified rule.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color that precedes it, three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the preceding color three times.

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
Analyzing the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or the rules underlying the use of the nonce word ""dax.""

1. In the first example, ""dax lug"" corresponds to ""green blue."" The word ""lug"" alone in different contexts corresponds to the color ""blue.""

2. In the second example, ""dax walm zup walm"" produces ""green green green yellow yellow yellow."" Here we can see that the word ""dax"" precedes a sequence of the same word (""walm"") and the output is a sequence of ""green"" followed by a sequence of ""yellow."" ""walm"" on its own seems to correspond to ""green.""

3. In the third example, ""wif dax zup dax"" results in ""red green yellow green."" Here ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The word ""dax"" appears twice and corresponds to ""green"" both times.

4. In the fourth example, ""wif dax bluf"" gives us ""red green green."" Here ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and produces an additional ""green,"" which is the same as the output of ""dax.""

5. The fifth example, ""lug dax zup wif,"" translates to ""blue green yellow red."" Again ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" The ""dax"" produces ""green.""

From these examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. However, when followed by a repeated word, as in the second example, it might indicate repetition of its corresponding output color before the pattern changes to the color corresponding to the repeated word.

Rule: dax -> green. The meaning of ""dax"" is the color ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, it seems the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Here is the observed pattern:
- wif lug -> red blue
- lug bluf wif -> blue blue red
- dax wif zup dax -> green red yellow green
- dax wif -> green red
- wif zup lug -> red yellow blue

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the input and output pairs provided, it seems that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. The outputs are consistent across all inputs where the same word appears.

- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green""
- ""walm"" also corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue""

The nonce word ""zup"" appears in each input and consistently corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
From the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" when followed by ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue."" In cases where ""bluf"" is not immediately followed by ""lug,"" it translates to ""yellow.""

Let's verify this hypothesis against each input/output example:

1. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - ""bluf"" following ""lug"" outputs ""blue.""

2. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   - ""bluf"" is not immediately followed by ""lug,"" so it outputs ""yellow.""

3. Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
   Output: blue red red green blue blue
   - First ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" not immediately by ""lug,"" and it outputs ""red"" (which seems to be the translation for ""wif."")
   - Second ""bluf"" is immediately followed by ""lug,"" so it outputs ""blue.""

4. Input: dax lug bluf
   Output: green blue blue
   - ""bluf"" is immediately followed by ""lug,"" so it outputs ""blue.""

5. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   - ""bluf"" is not immediately followed by ""lug,"" so it outputs ""yellow.""

Therefore, we can conclude:

Rule: When ""bluf"" is immediately followed by ""lug,"" it translates to ""blue."" Otherwise, it translates to the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it (e.g., ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so it becomes ""red""; ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so it becomes ""yellow"").

bluf -> blue when followed by ""lug""; otherwise, it assumes the color of the word before it.
Based on the provided examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be associated with the repetition of the color word that precedes it, one additional time for each occurrence of ""walm"". 

Let's analyze the examples:

1. In the first example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red,"" which means that ""walm"" caused ""wif"" (red) to be repeated an additional time.
2. In the second example, ""walm wif walm"" results in ""yellow yellow red red red."" Again, each ""walm"" results in the preceding color word being repeated one more time.
3. In the third example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" and ""lug"" is 'blue'.
4. The fourth example is just ""lug walm"" again, resulting in ""blue blue blue.""
5. The fifth example has ""wif walm,"" and as seen before, it translates to ""red red red,"" repeating 'red' due to ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> When ""walm"" follows a color word, it causes that color word to be repeated an additional time.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,36
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""lug"" translates directly to the word ""blue."" Each instance of ""lug"" in the inputs corresponds to ""blue"" in the outputs. 

Other words also seem to have a consistent translation:
- ""bluf"" translates to ""blue""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""lug"" is:

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input string or the other words present. Here is the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""lug dax"" corresponds to ""blue green."" The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" is consistently followed by ""green"" in every example.
- In the second example, the input ""dax"" on its own results in ""green,"" strengthening the deduction that ""dax"" means ""green.""
- The third example, ""lug wif dax,"" translates to ""blue red green."" The addition of ""wif"" adds ""red"" to the output, but ""dax"" remains represented by ""green.""
- The fourth input, ""dax lug bluf,"" yields ""green blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" likely does as well, but ""dax"" still translates to ""green.""
- In the final example, ""dax walm lug"" correlates with ""green green green blue,"" where ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" ""walm"" likely corresponds to another ""green,"" and ""lug"" is consistent with ""blue"" as established in previous examples.

Thus, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" is clear: dax translates to the color ""green"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" can be deduced to correspond to the color ""red."" In each instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output:

- dax wif zup dax -> green red yellow green
- dax bluf wif lug -> green green red blue
- wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
- wif walm -> red red red
- wif lug -> red blue

Rule: wif -> red
Given the examples:

1. Input: zup dax wif → Output: yellow green red
2. Input: wif zup → Output: red yellow
3. Input: zup dax walm lug wif → Output: yellow green green green blue red
4. Input: zup dax bluf → Output: yellow green green
5. Input: dax zup lug wif zup → Output: green yellow blue red yellow

Here's what we can deduce:

- Wherever ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow"".
- ""zup"" does not change based on its position in the input sequence.
- ""zup"" has the same output regardless of the words that follow or precede it.

Given these observations, the rule we can infer is quite straightforward:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the examples and their output:

1. ""wif bluf dax walm"" outputs ""red red green green green."" The word ""wif"" appears to correlate with the color ""red."" The word ""dax"" seems to associate with the color ""green,"" and ""walm"" seems to further continue the color ""green."" The presence of ""bluf"" after ""wif"" does not change the sequence of colors immediately, which might suggest that ""bluf"" acts as a modifier or has a context-dependent output.

2. ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red."" Here, with only ""wif"" and ""bluf"" present, the output remains red, not providing any additional information about ""bluf.""

3. ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" outputs ""blue blue blue red blue blue."" ""Lug"" associates with ""blue,"" and ""wif"" continues to associate with ""red."" The presence of ""bluf"" after ""lug"" changes the next color associated with ""wif"" from ""red"" to ""blue,"" implying that ""bluf"" may affect the following word's usual output color by changing it to the color associated with ""bluf's"" preceding word.

4. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" outputs ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" Here, ""lug"" is blue, ""dax"" is green, and ""zup"" seems to correlate with yellow. The ""bluf"" following ""lug"" does not change the output color immediately, but ""dax"" after ""bluf"" becomes green, which is consistent with ""dax"" on its own. So ""bluf"" doesn't seem to be altering ""dax's"" output.

5. ""lug dax bluf"" outputs ""blue green green."" ""Lug"" remains consistently blue, and ""dax"" consistently green. Here, the appearance of ""bluf"" after ""dax"" results in the color green being repeated, unlike in the second position.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" is not straightforward, as it does not seem to have a consistent direct color association. It may be that ""bluf"" extends the color of the word that follows it. In examples 1, 3, 4, and 5, ""bluf"" is followed by a word with a discernible color (such as ""dax"" being green) and in these instances, the color is repeated. This repetition does not occur in the second example, perhaps due to the absence of a third word which would usually have a color that could be extended by ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> ""bluf"" may extend the color associated with the word that follows it by one additional unit, repeating the color that would otherwise be assigned to the next word. If there's no word to follow, or if the rule is interrupted by the beginning of a new color sequence, it has no effect.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the provided input-output pairs one by one to identify any consistent patterns:

1. zup dax lug walm zup lug -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   The word ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and results in ""blue.""

2. lug wif lug walm zup walm wif -> blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   The word ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and results in ""blue;"" the second ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and results in ""yellow.""

3. dax walm wif walm zup -> green green green red red red yellow
   The word ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) and results in ""green.""

4. zup walm dax -> yellow yellow yellow green
   The word ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and results in ""yellow.""

5. wif walm dax -> red red red green
   The word ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) and results in ""red.""

Based on these examples, we can observe that the word ""walm"" seems to result in a repetition of the color that precedes it. Each time ""walm"" appears, it carries the color of the previous word up to the next color word. If ""walm"" is repeated, it continues to repeat the most recent color until a new color word is provided.

Rule: walm -> duplicate the color of the previous word until a new color word is introduced.

Hence:
walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: walm means to duplicate the preceding color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,37
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning: blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of context or position within the sequence of words.
Rule: dax -> green

Evidence for this rule comes from the consistent output of ""green"" whenever ""dax"" appears in the input:

- Input: lug dax -> Output: blue green (dax corresponds to green)
- Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue (the first word corresponds to green; since ""lug"" is blue, ""dax"" must be green)
- Input: wif dax wif -> Output: red green red (same pattern, dax corresponds to green)
- Input: dax lug -> Output: green blue (again, the first word is green, and we know lug is blue from other examples, so dax is green)

Based on these examples, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: Throughout the examples, whenever the nonce word ""wif"" appears, the corresponding output is always ""red"".
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's analyze the patterns in the input and output:

1. In the first example, ""zup dax wif"" translates to ""yellow green red."" The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

2. In the second example, ""zup bluf wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red."" Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" The word ""bluf"" is consistently translated to ""yellow,"" indicating that ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""yellow.""

3. In the third example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" translates to ""red yellow yellow blue blue green blue."" The pattern continues with ""wif"" translating to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" ""Bluf"" and ""lug"" translate to ""yellow"" and ""blue"" respectively, while ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

4. In the fourth example, ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" translates to ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue."" Correspondences hold, with ""wif"" for ""red,"" ""zup"" for ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" for ""blue."" The word ""walm,"" which appears twice, translates to ""yellow.""

5. In the fifth example, ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" translates to ""red green yellow red green green."" ""Wif"" consistently translates to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" to ""green.""

Through these examples, it is clear that ""zup"" always translates to ""yellow."" No matter where ""zup"" appears in the sequence, its output is consistently ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Given the examples provided, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it causes the repetition of the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it. Here is how it works based on your examples:

- ""dax bluf"" leads to ""green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", so ""bluf"" repeats the color for ""dax"".
- ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", so ""bluf"" repeats the color for ""wif"".
- ""wif bluf dax"" leads to ""red red green"" because ""bluf"" repeats the color for ""wif"" and then ""dax"" has its own color assignment as ""green"".
- ""lug wif bluf"" leads to ""blue red red"" because ""wif"" comes before ""bluf"", causing the color ""red"" to be repeated.
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" leads to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"" because ""zup"" comes before ""bluf"", causing the color ""yellow"" to be repeated twice for ""zup"" and ""bluf"", followed by repeating ""blue"" for ""lug"" and ""walm"".

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color corresponding to the word immediately before it.
Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

Using the given examples:

- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" which indicates that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" and that ""walm"" causes this color to be repeated three times.
  
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which indicates that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" and that ""walm"" causes this color to be repeated three times.

- ""dax zup walm wif"" results in ""green yellow yellow yellow red,"" so after ""dax"" (green), ""zup"" changes the color to yellow, and ""walm"" again repeats the last color mentioned (yellow) three times, followed by a new color ""red"" for ""wif.""

- ""zup walm dax lug"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow green blue,"" confirming that ""walm"" repeats the last color (yellow) three times, then ""dax"" is green, followed by a new color ""blue"" for ""lug.""

With the rule identified, walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. In every instance where ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Thus, the meaning of ""lug"" can be deduced as follows:

lug -> blue. Rule: When the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it is directly translated to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green."" Each time ""dax"" is presented in the input, it corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, each nonce word corresponds to a color:

- ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"".
- ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"".
- ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".
- ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"".
- ""walm"" seems to derive into ""blue"" repeated according to the number of letters in the word (in this example, ""walm"" is a four-letter word, therefore the output is ""blue"" repeated four times).

Given this information, the rule for the word ""wif"" without any context is:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word zup is consistently translated to the color yellow in each instance provided.
Rule: bluf -> the color word that matches the color word preceding it (if there is one). If bluf appears first or there is no color word before it, then it defaults to ""blue"".
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the input-output pairs to identify patterns.

1. lug zup walm lug
   blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" ""Walm"" follows ""zup"" and results in a repetition of ""yellow."" Thus, after ""lug"" there is no repetition, but after ""zup,"" ""walm"" causes repetition.

2. dax zup walm wif walm
   green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" ""Walm"" follows ""zup"" again and leads to yellow repeating. ""Walm"" follows ""wif"" resulting in ""red"" repeating.

3. dax walm wif dax
   green green green red green
   ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" resulting in two additional repetitions of ""green."" ""Walm"" appears to cause the preceding color to be repeated.

4. lug wif dax zup walm
   blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   ""Walm"" follows ""zup"" again, causing ""yellow"" to repeat.

5. dax lug wif walm
   green blue red red red
   ""Walm"" follows ""wif,"" which results in ""red"" repeating.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the preceding color to repeat. This repetition happens one more time if ""walm"" follows ""lug"" or ""dax,"" and two more times if it follows ""zup"" or ""wif.""

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color word to repeat multiple times, the exact number of repetitions depends on the word it follows. If ""walm"" follows ""lug"" or ""dax,"" the color repeats once more. If ""walm"" follows ""zup"" or ""wif,"" the color repeats twice more.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the given examples.
dax -> green. Rule: Whenever the word 'dax' is present in the input, the corresponding output is 'green'. The presence of other words in the input results in 'red' for each of those words, suggesting that those words do not correspond to 'green'.
Rule: wif -> red

From the given examples, every time the input includes the word ""wif,"" the output associated with that word is ""red."" Hence, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
Based on the examples given, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" In each instance where ""zup"" is present in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Therefore, the rule is as follows:

zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" generates a repetition of the color preceding it. Here's an analysis of each input and output:

- In example 1, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"" and later ""lug bluf"" again translates to ""blue blue"", while ""wif"" and ""zup"" stand alone as ""red"" and ""yellow"" respectively.
- In example 2, we see ""wif bluf"", which outputs ""red red,"" and ""lug zup"" leads to ""blue yellow"" without repetition because ""zup"" follows rather than ""bluf"".
- Example 3 exhibits the same pattern where ""dax"" represents ""green"" and is immediately followed by ""bluf"", resulting in ""green green"".
- Example 4 is a repetition of the third example pattern.
- In example 5, ""wif"" is repeated once as ""red red"" and then followed by ""lug bluf"", which then translates to ""red blue blue"", indicating the repetition of the ""blue"" color which follows ""lug"", while ""wif"" doesn't get repeated by ""bluf"" since it's not immediately preceded by ""bluf"".

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color word that comes immediately before it.
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word in the sequence the same number of times as the number of letters in the previous word. 

Examples:
- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"" (lug has 3 letters, so blue is repeated 3 times)
- ""zup walm dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green"" (zup has 3 letters, so yellow is repeated 3 times, then dax adds green)
- ""zup wif dax walm"" -> ""yellow red green green green"" (dax has 3 letters, so green is repeated 3 times)
- ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"" (zup has 3 letters, so yellow is repeated 3 times)
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"" (dax has 3 letters, so green is repeated 3 times)

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""lug"" relates to the color ""blue."" Each instance of ""lug"" is translated into ""blue,"" and the following words correspond to their own respective colors based on the outputs given. ""Zup"" means ""yellow,"" ""dax"" means ""green,"" and ""wif"" means ""red."" The word ""walm"" is repeated thrice in ""lug walm"" to mean ""blue blue blue,"" which may indicate that ""walm"" means ""blue"" as well, thus repeating the same color indicated by ""lug.""

Rule: lug -> blue.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the provided input and output examples, it can be deduced that whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the outputs provided.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"". Every instance where ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
From the given examples, we can induce the following patterns linked to the output:

- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"".
- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"".
- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"".
- ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"".

When ""bluf"" follows another word, it repeats the color of that word:

- In ""zup bluf"", ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"" following ""zup"" which is ""yellow"".
- In ""wif bluf"", ""bluf"" results in ""red"" following ""wif"" which is ""red"".
- In the sequence ""zup dax bluf"", ""bluf"" results in ""green"" following ""dax"" which is ""green"".
- ""lug wif bluf"" has ""bluf"" translating to ""red"", following ""wif"" which is ""red"".

Therefore, we can infer the rule:

bluf -> The rule is that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.

So, we can write it as:

bluf -> meaning: the color of the preceding word

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the output color of the word that comes immediately before it.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the relationship between the inputs and outputs.

- In the first and fourth examples, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"", indicating that ""walm"" translates directly to ""red red"" as ""wif"" is related to a single ""red.""
- In the second example, ""dax lug walm"" leads to ""green blue blue blue"". Here ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" and ""lug"" with ""blue,"" so ""walm"" would represent ""blue blue"" following the pattern.
- In the third example, ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red."" ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" as we've seen earlier. Following this, ""walm"" would again translate to ""blue blue.""
- The fifth example, ""dax zup dax walm,"" becomes ""green yellow green green green."" With ""dax"" related to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" it appears ""walm"" means ""green green"" in this context.

Based on the outputs, the word ""walm"" seems not to have a fixed meaning but rather repeats the color of the word preceding it twice.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" duplicates the color of the preceding word twice.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Each instance of the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs. Therefore, we can deduce:

dax -> green

Rule: When 'dax' is in the input, the output will include the color green at the position corresponding to where 'dax' appears in the input.

Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following patterns:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Now let's analyze the pattern involving the nonce word ""wif"":

- Whenever ""wif"" appears, the word ""red"" is produced in the output.
- The occurrence of ""wif"" does not seem to be affected by its position in the sequence.

Given these observations, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be that it corresponds to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position or how many times it appears.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" Each example provides a series of input words and a corresponding series of output colors. Let's examine each case to see if there is a pattern or rule that can help us determine what ""bluf"" means.

Example 1:
Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
Output: blue green green red green
In this example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" when following ""dax,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Example 2:
Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when following ""zup,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Example 3:
Input: zup lug bluf wif
Output: yellow blue blue red
In this example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" when following ""lug,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Example 4:
Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green
Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" when following ""dax.""

Example 5:
Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green
In this instance, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" when following ""dax.""

Rule:
From these examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that it immediately follows. So if ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it takes on the color green; if it follows ""lug,"" it takes on the color blue; and if it follows ""zup,"" it takes on the color yellow.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it replicates the color associated with the word that comes directly before it.

Bluf -> meaning: Bluf means the same color as the word before it.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can examine the pattern of outputs in relation to their inputs. Here are the observations:

1. ""lug walm"" maps to ""blue blue blue"".
2. ""dax zup walm wif walm"" maps to ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red"".
3. ""zup dax lug walm zup"" maps to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow"".
4. ""lug zup walm lug"" maps to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"".
5. ""dax walm"" maps to ""green green green"".

Let's break this down:

- Every time ""walm"" is present in the input, the corresponding output repeats a color three times.
- The color that is repeated three times corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm"":
    - ""lug walm"" results in ""blue"", which corresponds to ""lug"".
    - ""dax walm"" results in ""green"", which corresponds to ""dax"".
    - Etc.

Additionally, ""walm"" appears to cause the previous word's output color to repeat three times, regardless of what it is. There is no instance of ""walm"" appearing first, so we cannot make deductions about its behavior in that position. There is also no instance of ""walm"" being followed by another ""walm"" without an intervening word to observe if there's an accumulating effect.

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning. The repeated color corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm"", repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm wif
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow red,yellow yellow yellow red,True,42
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the inputs and outputs provided, it appears that each time the word ""lug"" is present in the input, the word ""blue"" is present in the corresponding output. No matter the position of ""lug"" within the input string or the context, it consistently translates to ""blue."" Thus, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""lug"" -> ""blue""
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each instance of ""dax"" in the input is replaced with ""green"" in the output. Other words in the input are replaced with different colors according to some rule not fully explained by the examples, but they consistently correspond to the same output color each time they appear. ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
wif -> red

Rule: The word 'wif' translates to the color red, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to induce the meaning or rule of the word ""zup"" by comparing the input and associated output strings. Let's analyze each pair:

- ""zup wif dax"" corresponds to ""yellow red green.""
- ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" corresponds to ""green green red yellow red.""
- ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- ""zup wif zup"" corresponds to ""yellow red yellow.""
- ""lug zup"" corresponds to ""blue yellow.""

Judging from the different input and output examples, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow."" Whenever ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output in its corresponding position.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow"".
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence. Here's the analysis:

- In the first example, ""dax"" results in ""green,"" and when ""bluf"" follows, the color ""green"" is repeated.
- Whenever ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color ""red"" is given once again.
- ""Zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and subsequently, ""bluf"" reproduces the ""yellow"" output.
- ""Lug"" alone corresponds to ""blue,"" and followed by ""bluf,"" ""blue"" is listed a second time.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be to repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> duplicate the color of the preceding word.
Based on the provided inputs and corresponding outputs, it appears that walm corresponds to a sequence of repeating colors. The sequence length and color match that of the word preceding walm. Here's the pattern:

- ""wif dax zup walm"" -> ""red green yellow yellow yellow"": The word before walm is ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and it is repeated three times.
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red"": The word before walm is ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and it is repeated three times.
- ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red"": The word before walm is ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and it is repeated three times.
- ""lug dax walm"" -> ""blue green green green"": The word before walm is ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and it is repeated three times.
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green"": The word before walm is ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and it is repeated three times.

We can observe from the examples that walm causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before it a number of times equal to the number of letters in the word before walm. For instance, ""dax"" has three letters and the color ""green"" is repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> meaning: Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" a number of times equal to the number of letters in that word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,43
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" by looking at the outputs and corresponding colors. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"" which corresponds to blue and ""wif"" which corresponds to red. So ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue"" and ""lug wif"" results in ""blue red.""
   - Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   - Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

- In the second example, ""lug"" comes before ""dax"" which corresponds to green. So ""lug dax"" results in ""blue green.""
   - Input: lug dax zup dax wif
   - Output: blue green yellow green red

- In the third and fourth examples, ""lug"" pairs with ""dax"" and ""zup"" just like before, resulting in ""blue green"" and ""blue yellow"" respectively.
   - Input: wif lug dax
   - Output: red blue green
   - Input: dax lug zup
   - Output: green blue yellow

- In the fifth example, ""lug"" comes before ""bluf"" which corresponds to blue. ""Wif walm lug"" results in ""red red red"" and ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue.""
   - Input: wif walm lug bluf
   - Output: red red red blue blue

By comparing these observations, it appears that the rule for ""lug"" is that it might be inducing a repetition of the color that follows it—a “doubling” function.

Rule: lug -> causes the next color word to repeat once.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" consistently corresponds with the color ""green."" Other words in the inputs seem to correspond to other specific colors as well. For example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Thus, the rule for ""dax"" in this context is:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples given, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in each instance, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it is possible to infer that the word ""bluf"" correlates to the color red when it follows ""wif"" and to the color green when it follows ""dax"" or when ""dax"" is the word that follows ""bluf."" However, because there are multiple instances of ""wif bluf"" leading to ""red red"" and only one instance of ""dax bluf"" resulting in ""green green"", the pattern for ""dax bluf"" might be less certain. 

So, the rule seems to be:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" or ""zup"", it corresponds to the color red.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", it corresponds to the color green.

Rule: bluf -> red when immediately following ""wif"" or ""zup""; green when immediately following ""dax"".
To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns between the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

1. ""dax lug walm"" => ""green blue blue blue""
2. ""wif walm lug bluf"" => ""red red red blue blue""
3. ""zup walm lug wif"" => ""yellow yellow yellow blue red""
4. ""zup wif walm lug"" => ""yellow red red red blue""
5. ""zup lug walm"" => ""yellow blue blue blue""

We can make the following observations:
- When ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" the output color corresponding to ""lug"" is repeated three times. 
- When ""walm"" appears before ""lug,"" the output color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" is repeated three times. 

Based on these patterns, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color output of the word preceding it three times. If ""lug"" follows it, repeat the color output of the word preceding ""lug.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,44
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Each instance of ""lug"" in the input translates to ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". When ""dax"" appears in the input, the output includes the color ""green"" for each occurrence of the word ""dax"". Other words in the input correspond to different colors (e.g., ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""). Each word is translated into its respective color, maintaining the order of appearance in the input.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red in the output, regardless of the other words' positions or the other colors mentioned. Hence, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following pattern: whenever the word ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow. ""Zup"" means the color ""yellow"".
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" appears to represent a sequence of colors ending with ""red."" The rule seems to be that for each instance of the word ""bluf,"" a specific sequence of colors is outputted and the sequence always ends with ""red."" However, ""bluf"" does not always generate the same sequence of colors. Instead, it seems to depend on the word(s) that come before it. Here's a breakdown of what ""bluf"" generates after certain words:

- After ""lug walm wif,"" ""bluf"" generates ""blue blue blue red red.""
- After ""zup wif,"" ""bluf"" generates ""yellow red red.""
- After ""dax,"" ""bluf"" generates ""green green blue red.""
- After ""wif dax wif,"" ""bluf"" generates ""red red.""
- After ""lug,"" ""bluf"" generates ""blue blue.""

Given the information above, the colors that precede the ""red"" in the sequence are determined by the word(s) immediately prior to ""bluf."" Moreover, ""red"" always occurs at the end of the sequence. The deciphered rule also tells us that the same word (e.g., ""lug"") will always generate the same colors before ""red"" when followed by ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> Generates a sequence of colors that are determined by the preceding word(s), always ending with ""red.""
Rule: The word ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it.

Explanation:
- ""lug wif walm"" translates to ""blue red red red,"" where ""wif"" correlates to red, and ""walm"" repeats the color ""red"" three times.
- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" showing that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" three times.
- ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""zup"" correlates to yellow, and ""walm"" repeats the color ""yellow"" three times.
- ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue,"" showing that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif"" (red) three times and then ends with ""lug"" which correlates to blue.
- ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" indicating ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup"" (yellow) three times, bookended by the respective colors of ""lug"" (blue).

walm -> Repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif walm zup
    ",Output: red red red yellow,red red red yellow,True,45
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" is present in the input, the word ""blue"" is present in the corresponding position in the output.
Rule: dax -> green

Each usage of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, we can infer the following:

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red
- The word ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red"" as the second color in the output.
- The words ""zup"" and ""bluf"" are not affecting the ""red"" output related to ""wif"".

Input: wif
Output: red
- ""Wif"" on its own results in the color ""red"". This reinforces the idea that ""wif"" is associated with ""red"".

Input: wif dax
Output: red green
- Again, ""wif"" results in ""red"". The additional word ""dax"" results in ""green"".

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue
- The word ""wif"" produces ""red"". The word ""lug"" seems to produce ""blue"" and ""walm"" may represent a repetition of the color correlated with the word before it, hence ""blue blue blue"".

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue
- ""Wif"" results in ""red"" and ""lug"" results in ""blue"".

Given these observations, the rule for the noun ""wif"" is:

Rule: wif -> red

This means that the nonce word ""wif"" is associated with the color red in the given context.
Rule: zup -> yellow

The examples consistently show that the word ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow in the output.
Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""bluf.""

Example 1: zup bluf -> yellow yellow
Example 2: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> red blue blue yellow yellow green
Example 3: zup bluf wif bluf -> yellow yellow red red
Example 4: zup wif bluf zup -> yellow red red yellow
Example 5: wif walm lug bluf -> red red red blue blue

It seems that every time the word ""bluf"" appears, it is translated to the color that was mentioned right before it. To wit:

1. ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and translates to yellow, so ""bluf"" also translates to yellow.
2. ""lug"" translates to blue before ""bluf"" and again ""bluf"" translates to blue. The same happens with ""zup"" translating to yellow before ""bluf,"" resulting in a repeated yellow.
3. ""zup"" translates to yellow, then ""bluf"" follows and also translates to yellow. This pattern repeats with ""wif"" translating to red, and ""bluf"" then also translating to red.
4. ""wif"" translates to red, so ""bluf"" that follows also translates to red. At the end of the sequence, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" which is yellow, and therefore ""bluf"" translates to yellow.
5. ""lug"" translates to blue, and subsequently ""bluf"" translates to blue. Prior to this, the pattern of ""wif"" translating to red is established and is not broken by the introduction of ""walm,"" suggesting that ""walm"" follows the same rule as ""wif.""

From the examples, we can infer the rule:

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we will look at each example and see how the input corresponds to the output.

In the first example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" and followed by ""zup lug"" which corresponds to ""blue blue yellow blue."" Notably, ""zup lug"" without ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue yellow blue"", and with ""walm"" it is ""blue blue yellow blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" seems to cause the previous color to be repeated before continuing with the sequence.

In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and is followed by ""lug,"" which correspond to ""green green green blue."" Without ""walm,"" the sequence ""dax lug"" corresponds to ""green blue."" When ""walm"" is present, it causes the color corresponding to the word ""dax"" to repeat before ""lug"" is translated to blue.

In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" with no other words, and the output is simply ""green green green."" This shows that ""walm"" is causing a repetition of the color green, which corresponds to ""dax.""

In the fourth example, adding ""wif"" to the end of the previous input does not change the earlier effect of ""walm"" but simply adds ""red"" to the sequence, which corresponds to ""wif.""

In the fifth example, ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" and before ""dax zup,"" resulting in ""red red red green yellow."" Here, ""walm"" is again causing repetition, this time of the color corresponding to ""wif.""

From these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the color corresponding to the previous word to be repeated three times before continuing with the sequence of colors.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,46
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word 'lug' corresponds to the color blue. Whenever 'lug' is mentioned in the input, the output includes the color blue.
dax -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, dax corresponds to the color green. 

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" is present, the output includes ""green"" at the same position as ""dax"". When ""walm"" is present, it also corresponds to green. However, ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. When ""wif"" follows ""dax walm,"" the output for ""wif"" is red.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" let's look for patterns in the provided examples:

1. In the first example, ""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax"" translates to ""red blue blue yellow yellow green."" From this, we cannot directly deduce the meaning, as ""wif"" appears only once. So, let's move on to the next example.

2. The second example, ""wif bluf lug,"" corresponds to ""red red blue."" Here ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" which in turn is followed by ""lug."" Since ""bluf"" is translated as ""blue"" and ""lug"" as ""red"" in this context, it appears ""wif"" could also mean ""red."" However, we cannot conclude this with certainty yet. Let's continue with more data.

3. In the third example, ""lug wif dax"" corresponds to ""blue red green."" Since ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" in this case means ""red.""

4. The fourth example, ""zup wif lug dax"" equaling ""yellow red blue green,"" shows ""zup"" as ""yellow,"" ""lug"" as ""blue,"" and ""dax"" as ""green,"" further suggesting that ""wif"" is ""red.""

5. Finally, in the fifth example, ""dax lug wif walm"" translates to ""green blue red red red."" Using what we've learned so far, ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue,"" so it stands to reason that ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" is ""red."" Since ""wif walm"" produces two reds, this might indicate that ""wif"" causes the following word to be repeated in meaning, but this is based on a single example and should be taken with caution.

Considering the consistent translation of ""wif"" into ""red"" across multiple instances, we can conclude:

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look at the outputs corresponding with its occurrences:

1. (dax zup wif) -> (green yellow red)
   Considering ""dax"" precedes ""zup"" and ""wif"" follows it, ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" with ""red.""
   
2. (zup lug) -> (yellow blue)
   Here, ""zup"" is followed by ""lug,"" where ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"" again and ""lug"" with ""blue.""
   
3. Again, (zup lug) -> (yellow blue)
   This example is the same as the previous one, which serves to reaffirm the relationship.

4. (wif walm dax zup) -> (red red red green yellow)
   Here, ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" ""walm"" also correlates with ""red,"" ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow"" as found in the first example.

5. (lug zup dax zup) -> (blue yellow green yellow)
   Here, ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" as found in earlier examples. ""zup,"" which occurs twice, consistently correlates with ""yellow"" as previously seen.

Rule: zup -> yellow. The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in each example, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
From the given examples, one can deduce the following mappings:

- ""wif"" maps to ""red""
- ""dax"" maps to ""green""
- ""zup"" maps to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" maps to ""red"" in the second example and ""green"" in the third example, suggesting its color might change based on the context or other words present. However, given that it appears at the end of the sequence each time, it may indicate that ""walm"" repeats the previous color.

The word ""bluf"" appears in each input and consistently results in a repeated color of the preceding word in the output. Here's how it maps:

- In ""wif dax bluf,"" the ""dax"" output is ""green,"" and ""bluf"" results in another ""green.""
- In ""wif bluf dax walm,"" ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""bluf"" reproduces another ""red"" immediately following it.
- In ""wif zup bluf,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" results in another ""yellow.""
- In ""zup bluf,"" we see ""zup"" as ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" again as ""yellow.""
- In ""zup bluf wif walm,"" we have ""zup"" as ""yellow,"" followed by ""bluf"" as ""yellow,"" and then ""wif"" as ""red,"" with ""walm"" repeating the red.

Therefore, we can conclude that ""bluf"" means to repeat the color of the previous word.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word before it. Here is the breakdown:

1. ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow"" which suggests that ""zup"" stands for ""yellow"" and ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup"" three times.
2. ""lug zup dax walm"" outputs ""blue yellow green green green."" ""Lug"" likely stands for ""blue,"" ""zup"" for ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" for ""green."" ""Walm"" then repeats the color of ""dax"" three times.
3. ""lug walm zup"" outputs ""blue blue blue yellow."" Here, ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" (from ""lug"") three times before moving on to ""zup"" which is ""yellow.""
4. ""zup walm lug wif"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow blue red."" ""Walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""wif"" is a new word which is translated to ""red.""
5. ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue,"" with ""walm"" repeating ""blue"" three times.

Rule: ""walm"" -> repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow blue,yellow yellow yellow blue,True,47
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in each of the examples provided.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color green each time it is used, regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it. Therefore, the rule is that ""dax"" means ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" let's examine each instance where it appears and the corresponding output:

1. Input: wif walm dax | Output: red red red green
2. Input: zup wif | Output: yellow red
3. Input: dax walm wif walm zup | Output: green green green red red red yellow
4. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug | Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
5. Input: wif walm dax | Output: red red red green

From these examples, we can see that every time ""wif"" is used, it is directly translated to ""red"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule appears to be: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" is consistently replaced with the color word ""yellow"" in each of the given examples.
bluf -> blue

Rule: Each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. The word 'bluf' consistently translates to the color 'blue' in each given example.
Based on the input and output examples provided, we can attempt to induce the rule that defines the meaning of ""walm.""  

First, we examine the commonality in input that contains ""walm"" and the corresponding output:

1. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" -> ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue""
2. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
3. ""wif walm zup walm"" -> ""red red red yellow yellow yellow""
4. ""wif walm zup"" -> ""red red red yellow""
5. ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow""

We can note the following:

- Every time ""walm"" appears in the input, a repetition of the immediately preceding color occurs in the output. It's as if ""walm"" signals a repetition, but the count varies with context.
- The first example has ""walm"" preceded by ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow"" indicating a double repetition of ""yellow.""
- However, the second example shows ""walm"" following ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and then the output is ""blue blue blue,"" indicating a triple repetition of ""blue.""
- The third example has a ""walm"" preceded by ""zup"" and ""wif,"" each resulting in triple and double repetitions, respectively, of their corresponding colors.
- The fourth example follows the triple repetition pattern when ""walm"" follows ""zup.""
- The fifth example breaks the cycle, suggesting that the count of repetition is not just dependent on ""walm,"" but may also be influenced by other words following ""walm."" In this case, ""dax zup"" follows ""walm,"" with ""dax"" mapping to ""green"" and ""zup"" mapping to ""yellow,"" but there isn't a repetition of ""green.""

From this analysis, we can infer that ""walm"" could represent the rule of repeating the color that immediately precedes it, but the repetition count may be affected by the context or additional words following ""walm."" The rule, however, is not entirely consistent as seen in the fifth example, which makes determining a definitive, context-independent meaning for ""walm"" challenging with the given data.

Rule: ""walm"" causes the immediate repetition of the color word before it, but the number of repetitions and the exact mechanic needs more data to determine a more clear-cut rule. 

Based on the given examples and the inconsistent nature of the fifth example, the most consistent interpretation, albeit limited, is:

walm -> Repeat the color word immediately before it (number of repetitions varies depending on context).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug walm dax
    ",Output: red blue blue blue green,red blue blue blue green,True,48
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: In every example, the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
Given the examples, we can deduce the meaning of ""dax"" by looking at the position of ""dax"" and the corresponding output. 

In the first example:
- ""lug wif dax"" translates to ""blue red green""
- Here ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""dax"" to ""green"".

In the second example:
- ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue green red blue red""
- ""lug"" still corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red"". ""dax"" appears after ""walm"" and is followed by ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"", and the sequence ""dax wif"" gives us ""green red"" just like in the first example. 

In the third example:
- ""wif dax bluf"" translates to ""red green green""
- Here, ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"", resulting in ""green green"". 

In the fourth example:
- ""zup dax"" translates to ""yellow green""
- ""zup"" precedes ""dax"" and corresponds to ""yellow"". 

In the fifth example:
- ""dax wif"" translates to ""green red""
- ""dax"" is followed by ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"", and ""dax"" translates to ""green"".

Taking all examples into account, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds directly to the color ""green"", regardless of the context or position in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:
dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by examining the context in which it appears and the corresponding output.

From the examples provided:

1. Input: wif
   Output: red

2. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow

3. Input: wif lug zup bluf
   Output: red blue yellow yellow

4. Input: wif
   Output: red

5. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

We can gather the following information:
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"".
- It does not seem to matter where ""wif"" is positioned in the input; whenever it appears, the output is ""red"".
- Other words in the input correlate to different colors in the output.
  - ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"".
  - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"".
  - ""walm"" correlates with ""green"".

Given the above patterns, it is reasonable to deduce the rule that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Let's check this against all the examples given:

Input: lug dax zup wif
Output: blue green yellow red
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" would correspond to ""yellow""

Input: lug zup
Output: blue yellow
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" would correspond to ""yellow""

Input: dax zup dax zup wif
Output: green yellow green yellow red
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow""

Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green""

Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
Output: green blue yellow red red green
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the relationship between the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

In each input, ""bluf"" corresponds to a varying color in the output, which means that ""bluf"" itself is not consistently translating to a single color, suggesting that ""bluf"" is not a direct substitution cipher for a color word. Instead, the meaning of ""bluf"" likely depends on a rule related to the other words present. By analyzing each line, we may identify the rule for ""bluf.""

Here are the inputs and outputs with ""bluf"" highlighted:

1. dax **bluf** -> green red
2. wif dax zup **bluf** -> red green yellow yellow
3. zup **bluf** wif lug dax -> yellow yellow red blue green
4. lug wif dax **bluf** wif lug -> blue red green green red blue
5. lug walm wif **bluf** -> blue blue blue red red

Now let's look for patterns:

- In examples 1 and 2, the color that appears directly after ""bluf"" is ""red."" 
- In example 3, the second instance of a color (""yellow"") corresponds to ""bluf.""
- In example 4, ""bluf"" appears after a sequence of three words, with ""green"" being the second color following it.
- In example 5, ""bluf"" again follows three words and the corresponding color is ""red,"" which is followed by a repeat of the color ""red.""

Based on these observations:

- ""bluf"" doesn't seem to refer to the same absolute position in the color sequence within the output.
- ""bluf"" doesn't always translate to the same color, but it's always followed by a repeat of the color word directly consequential to it.

Looking closely, ""bluf"" seems to trigger a repetition of the color that follows it in the sequence. So, the word after ""bluf"" is always repeated in the output sequence. This pattern holds in all the examples provided.

So, we could derive the rule that ""bluf"" cues a repetition of the color word that follows it.

Rule: bluf -> cues a repetition of the subsequent color word in the output.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it.

In the examples:

- When ""lug walm"" occurs, the output is ""blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with ""lug"" (blue).
- In ""dax wif walm,"" we see ""green red red,"" so ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif"" (red).
- ""zup wif dax walm"" gives us ""yellow red green green green,"" and ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax"" (green).
- ""wif lug zup walm"" leads to the sequence ""red blue yellow yellow yellow,"" with ""walm"" repeating the color of ""zup"" (yellow).
- Similarly, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" with ""walm"" again repeating the color of ""dax"" (green).

Thus, the rule associated with ""walm"" is that it repeats the color of the word before it.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color value of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax wif
    ",Output: blue green red,blue green red,True,49
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" we need to observe its occurrence in each example and the corresponding output. Let's break it down:

1. zup (yellow) wif (red) lug -> Output: yellow red blue
   - Here, ""lug"" corresponds to blue when it follows ""wif.""

2. lug wif (red) lug dax (green) bluf (green) -> Output: blue red blue green green
   - ""lug"" at the beginning corresponds to blue, and it still corresponds to blue when it follows ""wif.""

3. wif (red) dax (green) lug -> dax (green) -> Output: red green blue green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue after ""dax.""

4. dax (green) lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue when it follows ""dax.""

5. zup (yellow) wif (red) lug dax (green) -> Output: yellow red blue green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue placed after ""wif"" and before ""dax.""

By looking at all the examples, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue irrespective of its position in the sequence. So we can deduce that ""lug"" simply means blue.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, the rule that can be deduced for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" is:

dax -> green

Rule: When ""dax"" appears in the input, it translates to ""green"" in the output. The positioning of ""dax"" within a sequence does not change its associated color.
Based on the examples provided, each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. Here's how the colors pair up with the words:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" is also ""green,"" as seen in the second line (it's paired with ""dax"" which is ""green"" as well)
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" which can be deduced from the fourth line, since ""lug"" is blue and ""dax"" is green, leaving ""bluf"" to be green as well.

Since every time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output, the rule for ""wif"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: bluf -> the color that the word before it represents. If there is no word before it, then the color is yellow.

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" so bluf here means the color represented by the word before it, which is ""lug"" or blue.
- In the second example, ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow."" Since ""zup"" is before bluf, and the output for zup is yellow, bluf means yellow.
- In the third example, ""zup dax bluf"" translates to ""yellow green green."" Here, ""dax"" comes before bluf and translates to green, so bluf also means green.
- In the fourth example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red."" Since ""zup"" comes before bluf and translates to yellow, bluf means yellow.
- In the fifth example, ""zup bluf dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow green blue."" As ""zup"" comes before bluf and translates to yellow, bluf means yellow again.

Therefore, the rule for bluf seems to be that it represents the same color as the word that precedes it. If it is the first word or if there's no word before it that represents a color, it defaults to yellow (as seen in the second and fourth examples).
To deduce the meaning or rule of the word ""walm,"" let's analyze how the word corresponds to the output in each example.

1. lug walm zup lug zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
2. lug zup dax walm -> blue yellow green green green
3. lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
4. zup dax lug walm zup -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow
5. zup walm lug zup wif dax -> yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

From example 1, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to multiple ""blue"" outputs.

From example 2, ""walm"" occurs at the end and results in a repetition of ""green.""

From example 3, ""walm"" occurs after ""zup"" (yellow) and results in two additional ""yellow"" outputs before a final ""blue.""

In example 4, ""walm"" results in two additional ""blue"" outputs after ""lug.""

In example 5, ""walm"" results in two additional ""yellow"" outputs after ""zup.""

From this analysis, it appears that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. So, ""walm"" seems to mean repeat the color output of the word that comes just before it, generating multiple outputs of that color.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color output of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm zup lug bluf wif
    ",Output: blue blue blue yellow blue red,blue blue blue yellow blue blue red,False,50
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word 'lug' translates to the color 'blue'. Each time 'lug' appears in the input, 'blue' appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in each example provided.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow."" Every time ""zup"" is used in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output. Additionally, there seem to be other associations between input words and output colors:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Furthermore, the output sequence mirrors the input sequence of words, with each word being translated to its corresponding color.

Thus, the rule seems to be: 

zup -> ""yellow""

Rule: Translate each nonce word to a specific color as follows:
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
From the examples provided, we can attempt to ascertain the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" by looking at the consistent patterns between the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Here's what we can observe from each input-output pair:

1. ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow blue yellow yellow"". The words ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug"" correspond to ""green,"" ""yellow,"" and ""blue."" Since the last ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is immediately followed by ""bluf,"" which also corresponds to ""yellow,"" we can tentatively suggest ""bluf"" might mean ""yellow"" in this context.

2. ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"". Here again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" followed by ""bluf,"" which also translates to ""yellow.""

3. ""lug wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue blue"". ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" Since ""bluf"" comes after another ""lug"" and translates to ""blue,"" it supports our current hypothesis that ""bluf"" means ""yellow."" However, in this context, something different is happening as ""bluf"" becomes ""blue,"" not ""yellow."" This may indicate that ""bluf"" takes on the color immediately preceding it.

4. ""dax bluf wif zup"" translates to ""green green red yellow"". The ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" and in this output, ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green.""

5. ""lug bluf wif lug bluf zup"" translates to ""blue blue red blue blue yellow"". Each instance of ""bluf"" follows a color designation (e.g., ""lug"" for ""blue"") and takes on that same color in the output.

From the examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that comes directly before it.

So the rule is:

bluf -> meaning: Repeats the color of the preceding word.
walm -> repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes walm.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, the output is the color associated with the preceding word, repeated three times. For example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Similarly, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax walm lug bluf dax wif
    ",Output: yellow green green green blue blue green red,yellow green green green blue blue green red,True,51
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following:

- Whenever ""lug"" is present, ""blue"" is part of the output.
- ""lug"" by itself translates to ""blue"".
- ""lug"" in combination with ""dax"" translates to ""blue green"".
- ""lug"" does not seem to be affected by its position in the input (for example, it can come before or after other words and still translates to ""blue"" as part of the output).

Thus, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: lug -> ""blue""

This indicates that ""lug"" corresponds consistently to the color ""blue"" in the outputs.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" might correspond to the color ""green."" Let's look at the information given:

- Every instance where ""dax"" occurs, ""green"" is in the output.
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" which translates to ""green,"" the output is ""green green green,"" suggesting that ""dax"" itself might be green.
- When ""dax"" appears without ""walm,"" it still results in ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is the only input, the output is ""green.""

So, based on the examples, we can deduce:

Rule: dax -> green
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's look at the color sequences it corresponds to in the provided examples:

1. zup walm lug zup wif dax -> yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
Here, ""wif"" occurs before ""dax,"" and the sequence switches from ""yellow"" to ""red"" before the final ""green.""

2. lug wif dax wif -> blue red green red
In this sequence, ""wif"" occurs both before and after ""dax,"" which is associated with the color green, and each occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

3. dax bluf wif zup dax -> green green red yellow green
Here, ""wif"" follows ""bluf"" and precedes ""zup,"" with the output sequence showing ""red"" in place of ""wif"" between two colors not corresponding to ""dax.""

4. wif bluf dax -> red red green
Again, ""wif"" is followed by a different word (""bluf""), and is associated with the color ""red.""

5. zup dax wif -> yellow green red
In this last example, ""wif"" comes after ""dax,"" and the color sequence corresponds with ""red.""

In all cases, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" This suggests that ""wif"" translates directly to the color ""red,"" independent of its position in the sequence of words.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Each time ""zup"" appears in an input phrase, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output phrase at the same position. Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look for patterns in the examples provided:

1. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
   Output: blue green green red green
   - Here ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""green.""

2. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   - Here ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

3. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue red green green red
   - Here ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""green.""

4. Input: wif dax zup bluf
   Output: red green yellow yellow
   - Here ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""yellow.""

5. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - Here ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""blue.""

In all the examples, ""bluf"" seems to equal the color that was last mentioned before it (the second occurrence of a color). If we apply this rule to the examples:

- In the first example, ""dax"" comes before ""bluf"" and translates to ""green""; hence, ""bluf"" is also ""green.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" comes before ""bluf"" and translates to ""yellow""; hence, ""bluf"" is also ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" (which translates to ""green"") comes before ""bluf""; hence, ""bluf"" is also ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" (which translates to ""yellow"") comes immediately before ""bluf""; hence, ""bluf"" is also ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" comes before ""bluf"" and translates to ""blue""; hence, ""bluf"" is also ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the last color word that appeared before it.
Rule: The term ""walm"" is used to generate a triple repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. 

- In ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, so ""walm"" leads to ""green green green.""
- In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue.""
- In ""wif walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, so ""walm"" triggers ""red red red.""

Thus, walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that dax correlates with the color green. Every instance of the word 'dax' in the input corresponds to 'green' in the output, regardless of the position in the sequence or the other words present. Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green. 

Rule: The word 'dax' is translated to the color green in the output.
From the given examples, we can deduce that the input ""wif"" consistently produces the output ""red."" Therefore, wif seems to directly translate to red, and each repetition or combination of ""wif"" with another word results in ""red"" as part of the output. However, we are also given other words alongside ""wif"" like ""lug"" and ""bluf,"" which result in additional colors, ""blue"" and ""red red,"" respectively. As ""lug"" always translates to ""blue,"" but ""bluf"" only appears once, it is less certain what ""bluf"" translates to. We do not have enough occurrences of ""bluf"" to establish a pattern, yet it suggests that it might mean ""red red"" or add an extra ""red"" to the output. The word ""walm,"" which is combined with ""lug wif,"" results in ""red red red."" This suggests ""walm"" can mean ""red red"" or that it prompts an additional ""red"" for every ""wif"" mentioned. However, we would need more examples to confirm these additional assumptions.

Given the examples above, the rule for the word ""wif"" is as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> meaning. Meaning: ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow.""

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" is included once in the output for each occurrence of ""zup."" If ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" is included an additional time in the output for each occurrence of ""bluf."" If ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" is included in the output once for each occurrence of ""wif."" The word ""lug"" in the input does not seem to affect the output pattern based on the given examples.
Rule: bluf -> the color word that immediately precedes it. If ""lug"" means blue and ""wif"" means red, then ""bluf"" following these words turns into ""blue"" and ""red"" respectively.
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""walm."" Let's analyze the examples:

Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
- Here, ""walm"" is situated between two ""lug"" which correspond to ""blue."" Before ""walm"" we see ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
- ""Walm"" is followed by ""dax"" corresponding to ""green,"" and preceeded by ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow.""

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
- ""Walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" which is ""blue,"" and followed by ""zup"" which is ""yellow.""

Input: lug dax walm
Output: blue green green green
- ""Walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" which is ""green.""

Input: zup lug walm wif dax
Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
- ""Walm"" is between ""lug"" which is ""blue,"" and followed by ""wif.""

Considering the pattern in the examples, ""walm"" results in the repeated color that immediately precedes it, so the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm replicates the color word that immediately precedes it multiple times.

Therefore, we can define ""walm"" as follows: 

walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: The word ""walm"" refers to the repetition of the color represented by the word that comes immediately before ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax lug
    ",Output: blue green blue,blue green blue,True,53
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule:

lug -> blue

Therefore, whenever the word ""lug"" is present in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, it appears that dax corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the input sequence. 

Here are the associations evident from the examples:

- Whenever dax is present, the output contains green at the corresponding position.
- Other words have consistent associations with colors as well: bluf -> blue, lug -> blue, wif -> red, zup -> yellow.

Considering these observations, the rule for the nonce word dax is:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following pattern for the nonce word ""wif"":

1. In the first example, ""zup dax walm zup wif"", the corresponding output is ""yellow green green green yellow red"". We notice that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red"".

2. In the second example, ""wif bluf"", the output is ""red red"". Thus ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red"".

3. In the third example, ""lug wif walm"", the output is ""blue red red red"". Here, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", and ""walm"" also appears to translate to ""red"" when preceded by ""wif"".

4. In the fourth example, ""zup wif"", the output is ""yellow red"", supporting the idea that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

5. In the fifth example, ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax"", the output is ""red red yellow red blue green"", which again corresponds with the idea that ""wif"" translates to ""red"".

Considering this pattern, we can induce the following rule for the nonce word ""wif"":

Rule: wif -> red

Every instance of the word ""wif"" in the examples corresponds to the color red.
To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" let's take a look at the provided examples and their outputs:

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

Input: zup

Input: zup bluf wif dax lug
Output: yellow yellow red green blue

Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug

Input: zup lug walm wif walm

According to these examples, every time the input word ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow"". It appears consistently and independently of its position in the input series. This suggests a direct one-to-one mapping between the input ""zup"" and the output ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""

Meaning: zup means ""yellow"".
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color preceding its position in the sequence. We can determine this by looking at the corresponding outputs:

- In the first example, ""dax bluf zup"" yields ""green green yellow,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of ""dax,"" which is ""green.""
- The second example, ""wif lug zup bluf,"" results in ""red blue yellow yellow,"" showing that ""bluf"" shares its color with ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""wif bluf zup"" gives ""red red yellow,"" so ""bluf"" takes the same color as the previous word, ""wif,"" which is ""red.""
- For ""zup dax bluf,"" the output is ""yellow green green,"" where ""bluf"" again takes the color of the word before it, ""dax,"" which is ""green.""
- The last example, ""wif bluf,"" outputs ""red red,"" clearly showing that ""bluf"" follows the color of ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

Taking the provided evidence into account, we can form the following rule:

bluf -> Takes the color of the word that comes directly before it in the sequence.

Rule: bluf adopts the color of the preceding word.
Observing the provided examples, we can see the word ""walm"" and its corresponding color output. Here's the breakdown of each example:

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   * Here, ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"", the same color as the word before it, ""lug"".
   
2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   * ""Walm"" takes the color of ""zup"", which is ""yellow"".
   
3. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   * ""Walm"" is represented as ""blue"", following the color of ""lug"".
   
4. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   * ""Walm"" results in ""blue"", following ""lug"".
   
5. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   * The first ""walm"" follows the color of ""dax"" (green), and the second ""walm"" also takes the color of ""dax"" (green).

From these examples, we can induce that the rule for ""walm"" is that it takes on the color of the immediately preceding nonce word.

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the word before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug
    ",Output: red blue,red blue,True,54
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that whenever the word ""lug"" is present in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output in the corresponding position. There is no additional context provided with the word ""lug"" that would imply a more complex rule. ""Lug"" directly produces the output ""blue"" irrespective of its position among other words in the sequence or their corresponding colors in the output. Thus, the rule appears straightforward:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, the term ""dax"" seems to correspond to a specific color in the output. To induce the rule, let's see how ""dax"" is translated in each case:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green,"" wherein ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- In the second example, ""dax zup walm wif walm"" or ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red"" also places ""dax"" at the beginning, corresponding to ""green"" again.
- In the third example, ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" or ""red red blue green red,"" the term ""dax"" is at the fourth position, mapping to ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug dax wif lug"" or ""blue green red blue,"" ""dax"" is in the second position, corresponding to ""green.""
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""dax bluf zup"" or ""green green yellow,"" ""dax"" is at the beginning, and translates to ""green.""

Looking at these examples, it is clear that in every case the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, each input word appears to correspond to a specific output color, consistent across all examples. The word ""wif"" also corresponds to a specific color, which, considering its position and output in each example, does not depend on context.

Here are the mappings from the examples:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

The word ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red"" in every example it appears in, regardless of its position relative to the other words. Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> ""red""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in all given examples.
From the examples given, we can deduce a pattern of how the word ""bluf"" translates to colors in the outputs:

1. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue
2. zup bluf lug -> yellow yellow blue
3. zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue
4. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
5. wif bluf lug -> red red blue

Examining the second word in each sequence:

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and following it ""bluf"" yields ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""lug,"" with ""bluf"" corresponding to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is preceded again by ""zup"" and followed by ""lug,"" which follows the same rule as the second, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and again translates to ""red.""

However, there's a discrepancy in the fourth input, which pairs ""bluf"" with ""dax,"" resulting in a change from the expected ""blue"" or ""red"" to ""green."" This suggests that there might be a contextual rule at play rather than a simple direct translation.

Nonetheless, in the majority of situations, it appears that ""bluf"" maps to ""blue,"" except when followed by ""dax,"" which isn't consistent with the other examples.

A potential rule, given the majority of the data we have, is:

Rule: ""bluf"" represents the color ""blue,"" except possibly when the rules for ""dax"" come into play, as in the fourth example, which does not fit the other established patterns.

Hence:

bluf -> blue (with the exception noted).
To understand the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the outputs of each example and see how the presence of ""walm"" and the words before it affect the output:

- In the first example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue blue red blue blue"". The word ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and we see three ""blue"" in the output.
- In the second example, ""dax lug walm"" leads to ""green blue blue blue"". After ""lug walm"" we again see three ""blue"".
- In the third example, ""wif walm"" produces ""red red red"". Following ""wif"", three ""red"" appear.
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue"", giving us three ""blue"" after the ""lug"".
- In the last example, ""wif lug dax walm"" results in ""red blue green green green"". We see that after ""dax"" the color ""green"" is repeated three times.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" causes the output to be three repetitions of the color associated with the word directly preceding it.

Thus the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat three times the color associated with the word directly before ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,55
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Each instance of ""lug"" in the examples corresponds directly to the word ""blue"" in the output.
To figure out the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""dax,"" let's look at each example and identify the pattern:

1. Input: dax zup wif zup
   Output: green yellow red yellow
   Analysis: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

2. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
   Output: green red green yellow yellow
   Analysis: Both instances of ""dax"" correspond to ""green""

3. Input: dax
   Output: green
   Analysis: ""dax"" alone still corresponds to ""green""

4. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   Analysis: Among the mentioned words, only ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

5. Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
   Output: green green red yellow blue
   Analysis: ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green""

From these examples, it seems clear that the rule for ""dax"" is consistent across different contexts. No matter where ""dax"" appears in the sequence, it always corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"". Here's the observed pattern for the other words:

- bluf -> red
- dax -> green
- walm -> yellow (it appears twice after ""wif walm lug zup"" sequence, suggesting repetition for the number of times it appears)
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow

Therefore, given this information, the rule we can deduce is as follows:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the output.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in each example.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to translate to the color that the word immediately preceding it represents:

- Each occurrence of ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow.""
- Each occurrence of ""wif"" is followed by ""red.""
- Each occurrence of ""dax"" is followed by ""green.""
- Each occurrence of ""lug"" is followed by ""blue.""

Therefore, ""bluf"" means ""repeat the color corresponding to the previous word.""

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color corresponding to the previous word.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we will analyze the outputs associated with its presence and observe patterns:

In the first two examples, ""walm"" following a single word:
- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
- ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""

Each output is a repetition of a color three times, directly corresponding to the color assigned to the word preceding ""walm"":
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Next, we look at an example containing multiple instances and placements of ""walm"":
- ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" -> ""green blue blue blue green red red green""

Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (which, as found in the first example, corresponds to ""blue""), and the output is ""blue blue blue."" This reinforces the repeating color pattern. Later in the sequence, ""wif"" follows ""dax"" (which corresponds to ""green"") and leads to ""red red,"" which makes sense because ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" as established before, plus ""bluf"" indicates the joining of ""blue"" and ""red"" into ""green,"" which repeats due to ""dax.""

With a more complicated example:
- ""dax walm wif zup"" -> ""green green green red yellow""

In this example, ""walm"" occurs after ""dax"" and before ""wif."" The output sequence has ""green"" repeating three times, followed by ""red,"" which corresponds to ""wif."" The ""zup"" produces a ""yellow,"" suggesting it's a unique color word not patterned by ""walm.""

Lastly:
- ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" -> ""green green green red blue green green green""

Here, ""walm"" appears twice, once after ""dax"" (green) and once after ""lug"" (blue). In both cases, it causes a repetition of the corresponding color observed in the previous examples. ""wif"" precedes ""lug"" and, as per earlier examples, results in ""red"" which corresponds to ""wif.""

Consolidating the observed patterns, we can formulate the rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color word, the rule is to repeat the color that corresponds to that word three times.

Therefore:

walm -> repetition of the preceding color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax walm lug
    ",Output: yellow green green green blue,yellow green green green blue,True,56
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the word ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green"" consistently. This is confirmed by the following mappings:

Input: lug dax wif lug -> Output: blue green red blue
- Here ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, with ""lug"" corresponding to blue, and ""wif"" to red.

Input: dax wif lug -> Output: green red blue
- Again, ""dax"" is translated to green, ""wif"" to red, and ""lug"" to blue.

Input: wif lug dax walm -> Output: red blue green green green
- Once more, ""dax"" is translated to green. Note that ""walm"" seems to replicate the color that comes before it, evident from the ""green green green"" sequence where ""dax"" precedes ""walm"".

Input: dax -> Output: green
- ""Dax"" on its own is translated directly to green.

Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green
- ""Dax"" is followed by ""walm"" which repeats the color green twice more.

The rule we can derive:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Regardless of its position in the sequence, ""zup"" is consistently translated to ""yellow"" in the output.
Observing the pattern from the examples provided:

1. Each word before the word ""bluf"" in the input corresponds to a unique color in the output. Specifically, the word that precedes ""bluf"" determines the repeated color that appears twice in the output:
   - ""zup"" -> yellow
   - ""dax"" -> green
   - ""lug"" -> blue

2. The word ""bluf"" in the input seems to cause the output to repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word. 

3. Each other word in the input corresponds to a single instance of its associated color in the output:
   - ""wif"" -> red
   - ""walm"" -> red
   - ""lug"" -> blue
   
Given this pattern, we can deduce that ""bluf"" is an instruction to repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word in the output sequence.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""bluf"" in the input.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word that directly precedes it multiple times. To be precise, it seems that ""walm"" translates into the output color associated with the previous word being repeated three times.

Here is a breakdown that helps illustrate this point:

Input: lug wif zup wif walm
Output: blue red yellow red red red
Explanation: ""lug"" is blue, ""wif"" is red, ""zup"" is yellow. ""Wif"" comes before ""walm"" and its associated color, red, is repeated three times following it.

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
Explanation: ""wif"" is red, ""bluf"" doesn't directly correspond but seems like an outlier, ""dax"" is green. ""Dax"" comes before ""walm"" and its associated color, green, is repeated three times following it.

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green
Explanation: ""lug"" is blue. ""Walm"" comes after ""lug"", causing ""blue"" to be repeated three times. ""Dax"" is green.

Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
Explanation: ""wif"" is red, ""zup"" is yellow. ""Zup"" comes before ""walm"", and thus ""yellow"" is repeated three times after it. ""Dax"" is green, followed by another ""zup"" which is yellow.

Input: zup dax lug walm zup
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
Explanation: ""zup"" is yellow, ""dax"" is green, ""lug"" is blue. ""Lug"" comes before ""walm"", prompting ""blue"" to be repeated three times after it. ""Zup"" then follows, which is yellow.

Given the pattern, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word that comes before ""walm"" three times.

So, using the above format:
walm -> Repeat the preceding color output three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax bluf wif
    ",Output: green green red,green green red,True,57
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: In the given examples, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following:

- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- The other words in the examples (""lug,"" ""wif,"" ""walm,"" ""zup"") are associated with different colors each time they appear.

Here's the breakdown of each provided example:

1. ""dax"" outputs ""green.""
2. ""lug dax wif"" outputs ""blue green red,"" so we can infer ""lug"" means ""blue,"" and ""wif"" means ""red.""
3. ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green,"" so we can deduce that ""walm"" means ""green.""
4. ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" outputs ""blue green yellow green green green red,"" which indicates that ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
5. ""dax lug"" outputs ""green blue,"" so again, ""lug"" means ""blue.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the presented examples, we need to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif."" To do this, we will look for patterns in the input and their corresponding output:

1. When the input is only ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""
2. In every instance where ""wif"" appears, the output contains ""red.""

- In the second example, ""wif"" is followed by ""dax"" and ""zup"" after ""lug."" The output for ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and follows ""zup."" Again, ""wif"" correlates with ""red"" and ""walm"" seems to correlate with ""red"" as well, but with repetition.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" precedes ""zup."" The output for ""wif"" is ""red"" while ""zup"" is ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" follows ""walm"" and precedes ""dax."" The output for ""wif"" is ""red,"" just like before, and ""dax"" is ""green.""

There is a clear pattern that no matter where ""wif"" appears in the input, the output is ""red."" The context does not change its meaning. Therefore, we can conclude:

Rule: wif -> red.
Rule: ""zup"" equates to the color that comes next in the pattern: red, blue, yellow, green, repeat.

In the given examples:

1. After ""zup,"" the colors appear as yellow, yellow, red, blue, green: this gives the sequence RBYG.
2. ""zup wif"" translates to yellow red, so ""zup"" is yellow, and ""wif"" is always red.
3. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" becomes yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow. The ""zup"" after ""lug"" (blue) is yellow, and ""walm"" appears to stand for yellow as well.
4. ""dax wif walm lug zup"" translates to green red red red blue yellow. Therefore ""zup"" following ""lug"" (blue) is yellow again.
5. ""wif zup dax bluf"" results in red yellow green green. Implicitly, ""zup"" after ""wif"" (red) is yellow, followed by ""dax,"" which is green.

Considering these sequences, it's evident that ""zup"" follows a pattern of colors that succeeds the last color mentioned before ""zup."" Based on the given patterns, the sequence of colors seems to cycle through red, blue, yellow, and green. ""Zup"" represents the next color in the sequence following the color before it.

zup -> the next color in the pattern following the last color before it, cycling through red, blue, yellow, green.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the input-output relationships. 

Here's what we can gather from each example:

1. Input: ""dax lug bluf dax"" 
   Output: ""green blue blue green"" 
   
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   
2. Input: ""wif bluf""
   Output: ""red red""
   
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
   
3. Input: ""dax zup lug zup bluf""
   Output: ""green yellow blue yellow yellow""
   
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   
4. Input: ""zup bluf""
   Output: ""yellow yellow""
   
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   
5. Input: ""zup walm lug wif bluf""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red""
   
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" seems to be mirroring the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

For example:
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the associated color is ""blue.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the associated color is ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the associated color is ""yellow.""

The rule appears to be that ""bluf"" duplicates the color of the preceding word, indicating that ""bluf"" means to repeat or duplicate.

bluf -> meaning: The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word.
From the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color word preceding it.

For the first two examples:
- ""wif lug walm"" translates to ""red blue blue blue"", indicating that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug"" which is ""blue"".

For the third example:
- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"", where ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax"", which is ""green"".

For the fourth example:
- ""lug wif walm"" translates to ""blue red red red"", so ""walm"" is repeating the color of ""wif"" which is ""red"".

For the fifth example:
- ""dax lug walm zup wif"" translates to ""green blue blue blue yellow red"", and ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug"" which is ""blue"".

According to these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it three times.

Therefore:

walm -> repeating the previous color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Input: dax lug wif
    ",Output: green blue red,green blue red,True,58
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in every example provided.
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule:

- Every time the word ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- When ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red.""

Thus, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns where it appears and the associated output colors:

1. ""dax zup bluf"" -> green yellow yellow
2. ""wif bluf"" -> red red
3. ""lug bluf"" -> blue blue
4. ""wif bluf lug zup"" -> red red blue yellow
5. ""lug walm wif bluf"" -> blue blue blue red red

The pattern to focus on is the position of ""bluf"" in relation to the other words, and the number of colors mentioned in the output after ""bluf"" appears:

In examples 2 and 3, ""bluf"" follows a single word, ""wif"" or ""lug,"" respectively. The output is red red following ""wif"" and blue blue following ""lug."" This could indicate that ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word before it. 

However, example 1 shows ""bluf"" at the end after two words, ""dax zup,"" with outputs green and yellow, and the output after ""bluf"" is yellow yellow, repeating the color for the last word before ""bluf.""

In example 4, ""bluf"" is found after ""wif"" and before ""lug zup,"" and the pattern of colors following ""bluf"" is red red blue yellow, which corresponds to red for ""wif"" (repeated), followed by blue for ""lug"" and yellow for ""zup.""

Finally, example 5 shows ""bluf"" after the sequence ""lug walm wif."" The colors before ""bluf"" are blue blue blue, and after ""bluf"" are red red, indicating ""bluf"" again causes a repetition of the color associated with the word before it, ""wif,"" which is represented by red.

From this analysis, ""bluf"" appears to be associated with repeating the color of the word immediately before ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately before ""bluf.""
Based on the given examples, it's clear that the nonce word ""walm"" triggers a sequence of the same color word to be repeated. Let's analyze each instance:

- In the first example, ""dax walm"" resulted in ""green green green,"" suggesting that ""walm"" after ""dax"" produces three greens.
- In the third example, ""lug walm"" produced ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" after ""lug"" generates three blues.
- In the fourth example, ""zup walm"" led to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" showing that ""walm"" after ""zup"" leads to three yellows.
- The fifth example, which is only ""lug dax walm"", follows the sequence with ""blue"" for ""lug"", ""green"" for ""dax"", and then ""green green green"" for ""walm"" reinforcing the rule that ""walm"" generates three of whatever color preceded it.

In every case, ""walm"" repeats the output color three times that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" appears after a color word (which has its own representation in the output like ""dax"" for green, ""lug"" for blue, ""zup"" for yellow etc.), it causes the output to repeat that color word three times.

Thus, walm -> repeated thrice the color word that precedes it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

3. ""wif walm dax zup"" corresponds to ""red red red green yellow"" – ""wif"" comes before ""walm,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup,"" which are followed by ""red.""

4. ""zup dax wif"" corresponds to ""yellow green red"" – the pattern is consistent, with ""wif"" resulting in ""red.""

5. ""lug walm wif zup wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue red yellow red"" – ""wif"" follows ""lug"" and ""walm"" resulting in ""blue red,"" and then after ""zup"" (which is ""yellow""), it appears again as ""red.""

This leads to the rule:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow.

Rule: The nonce word 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow' in every instance it appears.
bluf -> rule. Rule: The meaning of bluf is the last color word mentioned before it. If no color word has been mentioned, bluf takes the meaning of ""blue"". For instance:

- In ""lug bluf"", ""lug"" means blue, so ""bluf"" takes the meaning of blue, resulting in ""blue blue"".
- In ""lug wif lug dax bluf"", the colors mentioned before bluf are blue (lug), red (wif), and green (dax), with green being the last one. Therefore, ""bluf"" means green, resulting in ""blue red blue green green"".
- In ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"", ""wif"" means red, so the first ""bluf"" takes the meaning of red, while the second ""bluf"" follows after ""lug"" which means blue, so the second ""bluf"" is blue, resulting in ""blue red red green blue blue"".
- In ""wif lug zup bluf"", ""zup"" means yellow, so ""bluf"" takes the meaning of yellow, resulting in ""red blue yellow yellow"".
- In ""dax zup bluf"", ""zup"" means yellow, so ""bluf"" also means yellow, resulting in ""green yellow yellow"".
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the outputs where the input includes the word ""walm"":

1. wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif -> red red green green red red red blue red
   - In this sequence, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), and before ""lug"" (blue), resulting in ""red blue red"".

2. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
   - Here, ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" (yellow), and the entire output sequence is yellow.

3. dax walm wif -> green green green red
   - ""walm"" is between ""dax"" (green) and ""wif"" (red), resulting in ""green red"".

4. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) with no word after ""walm"", and the output is all blue following the appearance of ""walm"".

5. dax wif walm -> green red red red
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) with no word after ""walm"", and the output is all red following ""walm"".

From the above examples, we can infer a rule that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it until the end of the sequence or until a new word gives a different color.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color output of the preceding word until a different colored word appears or the sequence ends.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,60
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
By examining the patterns within the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can try to infer the meaning of the nonce word ""lug.""

From the examples, it's apparent that whenever ""lug"" appears, the word ""blue"" is part of the output. Notice how ""lug"" never occurs more than once in any given input, and ""blue"" never repeats in the output unless there is another word that indicates repetition (like ""walm"" seems to be linked to ""blue"" repeating in the second example).

The inputs and outputs can be matched as follows:

1. lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow
   ""lug"" correlates with the first ""blue.""

2. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red
   ""lug"" correlates with the first ""blue.""

3. lug wif dax -> blue red green
   ""lug"" correlates with ""blue.""

4. zup dax lug wif dax -> yellow green blue red green
   ""lug"" follows ""dax"" and correlates with ""blue"" after ""green.""

5. zup lug dax -> yellow blue green
   ""lug"" is between ""zup"" and ""dax"" and correlates with ""blue"" between ""yellow"" and ""green.""

Based on these observations, it seems that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input or the other words around it. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, we can infer the following mappings:

- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green

Each time a nonce word is presented, a color is outputted. The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sentence or the context provided by surrounding words.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the nonce word ""wif"" appears in the input, it is translated to ""red"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of the position in the sequence or the presence of other words. Each of the other words seems to correspond to a different color.

Here's the observed output for each input word:
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- bluf -> green
- lug -> blue
- walm -> red (repeated for the number of letters in the word)

With this pattern, we can now define the meaning of ""zup"":

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples given, each instance of a word is associated with a specific color. Matching the input words to their corresponding output colors, we can infer that:

- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue""
- ""walm"" does not have a direct corresponding output, but given that it's in the sequence where ""zup"" outputs ""yellow,"" it's reasonable to infer that ""walm"" translates to ""yellow"" as well, since the output is a repetition of ""yellow"" in that example.

In all examples, when ""bluf"" appears, the color following it matches the color produced by the word immediately preceding ""bluf"". Therefore, we can deduce that the word ""bluf"" probably means ""repeat the color of the previous word"".

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Repeat the color of the previous word"".
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" might mean ""repeat the color of the prior word,"" with the number of repetitions depending on the word that comes before ""walm."" Let's examine the patterns:

1. zup dax walm -> yellow green green green
In this example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to the color green, and the output is green repeated three times.

2. dax lug dax lug walm -> green blue green blue blue blue
Here ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to the color blue, and the output is blue repeated four times.

3. lug walm -> blue blue blue
""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" with the color blue repeated three times.

4. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
""Walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color red, and the output is red repeated three times, followed by ""lug"" which corresponds to the color blue.

5. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
""Walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to the color yellow, and the output is yellow repeated three times.

Rule:
The rule appears to be that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color word that comes before it. The number of repetitions is one more than the number of times the preceding word has been stated before ""walm"" in the sequence. Hence, if a word appears for the first time and is followed by ""walm,"" the output color will be repeated three times; if it is the second appearance of the word, the color will be repeated four times, and so on.

walm -> repeat the color of the prior word, adding one repetition for each occurrence of that word before ""walm"" in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm
    ",Output: green green green,green green green,True,61
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" in the examples corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the outputs.
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" seems consistent.

Rule: dax -> green

Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""green"". There is no variability in this, meaning that ""dax"" has a one-to-one mapping with the color green, irrespective of its position in a sequence or the presence of other words.
By observing the patterns and given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"". Here's the breakdown for each example:

- In the first input, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", which translates to ""red red"". 
- The second input has ""wif"" before ""lug"" and both instances lead to ""red blue"".
- In the third input, ""wif"" again precedes ""lug"", leading to ""red blue"".
- The fourth input directly translates ""wif"" to ""red"".
- The fifth input starts and ends with ""wif"", and these are translated to ""red"" at both positions.

Based on these consistent translations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, zup seems to translate to a single color output every time. In each instance where zup appears, regardless of the other words it is paired with, the output always includes ""yellow"". Additionally, it seems that each word has its own color associated with it and multiple instances of the same word result in repeated color outputs. 

For example, the first input contains ""walm"" twice and the output has ""red"" repeated three times (since the first instance of a word gets its color outputted once and subsequent instances get the color repeated). Similarly, ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and when it appears twice in the fourth example, we get ""green"" both times. Given the data, we can deduce:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow"" 

Every time zup appears in the input, a single ""yellow"" appears in the output.
Given the examples, we can see that each instance of ""bluf"" in the input corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output. Here's a breakdown of each example:

1. ""zup bluf lug"" -> ""yellow yellow blue"": ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" which corresponds with ""yellow,"" and precedes ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue."" There are two ""yellows"" because ""zup"" also precedes ""bluf.""
   
2. ""lug wif bluf"" -> ""blue red red"": ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and ""wif,"" which corresponds with ""blue"" and ""red,"" respectively. ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" in this case, which could indicate a potential sequence, but let's look further.
   
3. ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red green red red"": ""bluf"" here comes after two instances of ""wif,"" which have been associated with ""red."" In this output, ""bluf"" again translates to ""red.""
   
4. ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" -> ""red blue blue red yellow"": ""bluf"" is between ""lug"" (""blue"") and ""wif"" (""red""). In the output, it translates to ""blue,"" which matches our initial guess from example 1.
   
5. ""lug dax bluf wif dax"" -> ""blue green green red green"": ""bluf"" is sandwiched between ""dax"" (""green"") and ""wif"" (""red""). The output for ""bluf"" is ""green,"" which doesn’t align with the ""blue"" assumption we had.

Given these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" does not correspond to any single consistent color output, as it translates to ""blue"" in some instances and ""red"" or ""green"" in others. So, we need to identify another rule that governs the output:

One potential rule could be that ""bluf"" translates to the color that directly precedes it, but this doesn't hold for the first and second examples.

Another observation is that the output color for ""bluf"" has so far matched the immediate word following it, except for the first example. This could offer a clue, but we must keep in mind the initial contradiction.

Given these conflicting signals, and assuming that there is a consistent rule for ""bluf,"" it seems likely there's a sequential aspect that depends on the words around ""bluf."" However, with the given examples, we do not have a clear, definitive rule that applies to all instances of ""bluf.""

The best deduction from the current examples, with an exception for the first one, is:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> The word ""bluf"" translates to the output color corresponding to the word that comes immediately after ""bluf"" in the input sequence. 

However, it is essential to note that this rule does not apply to the first example, indicating that there may be additional contextual factors or a rule not yet discerned from the given examples. More examples would help refine this rule further.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup,"" the corresponding output colors are ""red red red green yellow."" Assuming ""walm"" has a consistent color output regardless of its position, we could infer that ""walm"" might be related to the color yellow in this context because it is the only new element after ""wif dax zup,"" which have consistent red, green, and yellow outputs respectively.

2. When ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence after ""wif dax zup,"" the output colors are ""red green yellow yellow yellow."" This reinforces the idea that ""walm"" is associated with the color yellow.

3. When ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence after ""wif zup bluf lug,"" the output colors are ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue."" ""Bluf"" seems to correlate to blue, and since ""walm"" follows it and the output is all blues after it, the pattern of ""walm"" being yellow seems to be altered in its presence, suggesting a possible interaction or rule change. ""Lug"" also determines the output color blue. 

4. When ""walm"" follows ""dax lug,"" the output colors are ""green blue blue blue."" With ""dax"" associating with green and ""lug"" with blue, the appearance of ""walm"" again results in an all blue output after ""lug.""

From these examples, we can establish that ""walm"" generally correlates to the color yellow except when it follows an element that outputs as blue ('bluf' or 'lug'). When following these blue elements, the output for ""walm"" matches the output for the preceding blue element instead of transforming to yellow.

Rule: ""walm"" results in the color yellow unless it directly follows an element that correlates to blue, in which case ""walm"" also results in blue. 

walm -> meaning: walm typically means yellow, but means blue when following blue-associated elements.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,62
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in every given example.
Based on the examples provided, it appears the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the same position in the output.

Rule: ""dax"" -> ""green""
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we can analyze the provided examples and their respective outputs:

- dax wif bluf -> green red red
- zup wif -> yellow red
- zup lug wif -> yellow blue red
- lug wif -> blue red
- wif bluf lug -> red red blue

From the examples, it appears that each word corresponds to a color:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> red

By analyzing the position of ""wif"" in relation to the other words and the resulting color sequences, we can observe that ""wif"" always corresponds to the color red, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Thus, the rule is:

wif -> red
Looking at the examples provided, it seems that ""zup"" translates to a specific color, with its exact hue determined by the context of the adjacent word(s). Let's examine each example:

1. Input: zup wif bluf -> Output: yellow red red
2. Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
3. Input: dax zup wif bluf lug -> Output: green yellow red red blue
4. Input: zup wif lug zup walm -> Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
5. Input: zup wif zup -> Output: yellow red yellow

""Zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow,"" so that seems to be its base meaning. However, when followed by ""wif"" (but not ""lug"" or ""walm""), it results in an additional ""red."" Therefore, ""zup"" on its own is ""yellow,"" but ""zup wif"" is ""yellow red.""

Here are the rules I have derived from the examples:

- ""zup"" on its own translates to ""yellow.""
- When ""zup"" is immediately followed by ""wif,"" it results in the sequence ""yellow red.""
- The presence of ""zup wif"" before another word does not seem to affect the translation of that following word (as seen by ""bluf"" consistently translating to ""red"" whether ""zup wif"" precedes it or not).
- ""Zup"" is not affected by prior words that are not ""wif,"" as seen in the third example where ""dax"" is translated independently to ""green,"" and ""zup"" following it translates to ""yellow.""

Thus, the rule can be summarized as:

Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and when immediately followed by ""wif,"" the sequence is ""yellow red.""
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" might be acting as a sort of repeater or duplicator for the word that precedes it. When ""bluf"" follows a word, the color translation of that word is repeated twice in the Output. Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   The word ""dax"" translates to ""green"", and it's followed by ""bluf"", which results in ""green"" being repeated twice.

2. Input: wif bluf lug
   Output: red red blue
   ""wif"" translates to ""red"", followed by ""bluf"", leading to ""red"" being repeated. Then, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".

3. Input: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup
   Output: blue blue red blue blue yellow
   ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and is duplicated by ""bluf"". Then, ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""lug"" is ""blue"" again. Lastly, ""bluf"" duplicates ""blue"" once more, and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".

4. Input: wif zup dax bluf
   Output: red yellow green green
   ""wif"" translates to ""red"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""bluf"" duplicates ""green"".

5. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   This example is the same as the first one, where ""dax"" becomes ""green green"" due to ""bluf"".

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color translation of the preceding word.
Based on the given examples, the meaning of ""walm"" appears to directly relate to the repetition of the output color associated with the preceding word. In each case where ""walm"" appears, it is followed by repetitions of the same color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""walm"". The number of repetitions corresponds to the number of times ""walm"" is mentioned. Here is the analysis:

- ""lug dax walm"" results in ""blue green green green"", so ""walm"" leads to repeating ""green"" three times.
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"", which means ""walm"" leads to the word ""yellow"" being repeated three times.
- ""lug zup walm lug"" yields ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"", so ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to repeat three times.
- ""dax zup walm wif"" produces ""green yellow yellow yellow red"", which again shows that ""walm"" causes the prior color, ""yellow,"" to be repeated three times.
- Repeating the same input of ""zup walm"" confirms the previous output as ""yellow yellow yellow"".

This analysis leads to the following definition:

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,63
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue in the outputs.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""dax,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs to see how the presence of ""dax"" in different contexts corresponds to different outputs.

Analyzing the inputs and their respective outputs:

1. Input: ""dax zup wif"" -> Output: ""green yellow red""
2. Input: ""wif dax"" -> Output: ""red green""
3. Input: ""dax walm wif zup"" -> Output: ""green green green red yellow""
4. Input: ""dax zup bluf"" -> Output: ""green yellow yellow""
5. Input: ""zup lug wif dax lug"" -> Output: ""yellow blue red green blue""

From the examples, every time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. We can thus infer the rule that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each nonce word correlates to a specific color. The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red.""

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red

Meaning that ""wif"" represents the color red in each given context.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, where ""bluf"" appears and the corresponding colored outputs, we can deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" by looking at the patterns that arise when it is used. By examining the input and output pairs, we can infer the following pattern:

- Each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output.
- When other words precede ""bluf,"" the output colors match a certain pattern (e.g., ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""wif"" to red, ""zup"" to yellow).
- The word ""bluf"" results in the color that immediately follows the corresponding color of the preceding word. If ""bluf"" is the first word or the previous word is at the end of the pattern, it resets to the beginning of the color pattern sequence.

Let's analyze the instances where ""bluf"" is used:

1. ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green."" Since ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""bluf"" here could mean a repetition of the previous color.
   
2. ""zup bluf wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red red."" Again, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color of the preceding word.

3. However, looking at ""wif walm lug bluf"", the output is ""red red red blue blue."" It appears that ""bluf"" not only repeats the color after a word matching that color (red after ""wif""), but it can also add an additional occurrence of the color that follows in the sequence (hence ""blue"" after the third red). Since we have not been told the word corresponding to blue, it's hard to establish a solid pattern without guessing.

Deducing from this, the most consistent pattern we can identify is that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word preceding it if the output for that word is known. When ""bluf"" appears with a word whose output color we do not know, like ""walm"", we cannot conclusively determine what output ""bluf"" generates based on the information given.

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word when the output for that word is known. If the output color for the preceding word is not known, ""bluf"" seems to follow with a color that is part of an established sequence, suggesting that there might be a fixed cycle of colors—however, the full pattern is not clear from the given examples.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" takes on the color value of the word that precedes it. The output is a repetition of the color corresponding to the previous word, followed by that color a number of times. Here are the rules that seem to be in effect, based on the examples provided:

- ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

In each example where ""walm"" appears:

- After ""lug"" (blue), ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue.""
- After ""dax"" (green), ""walm"" is ""green green green.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and ""wif"" (""blue"" ""red""), it results in ""red red red.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), it results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

Rule: If X represents the color corresponding to the preceding word, ""walm"" translates to ""X X X.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"":

lug -> meaning: blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the input and output examples provided, it's possible to deduce the meaning of ""dax"" by comparing the common elements in both the input and the output. 

Let's examine each example:

- In the first input ""zup dax lug,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the second input ""wif dax zup walm,"" we see that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and we've already established that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" ""Walm"" does not have a direct match since it is repeated three times, possibly indicating a threefold repetition of the prior color ""yellow.""
- The third and fourth inputs ""dax lug"" both output ""green blue,"" confirming that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
- In the fifth input ""lug dax wif,"" we see again that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

These comparisons consistently show that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in every instance.

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""zup,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs closely. 

- Every time ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output.
- Whenever ""dax"" appears, it corresponds to ""green.""
- ""Wif"" seems to consistently map to the color ""red.""
- ""Walm,"" whenever it appears, corresponds to the sequence ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Now, noting where ""zup"" appears:

- In the first example, ""zup"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the output is ""yellow"" followed by ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" stands between ""lug"" and ""walm,"" with ""blue"" preceding it and ""yellow yellow yellow"" after it, but ""zup"" corresponds to only one ""blue"" in the output.
- In the third example, ""zup"" is followed by ""lug"" again, and once more ""yellow"" precedes ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" precedes ""wif"" and ""dax,"" with ""yellow"" preceding ""red"" and ""green.""
- Lastly, ""zup"" precedes ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""walm,"" and again ""yellow"" comes before ""red,"" ""green,"" and ""green green green.""

From these observations, it is clear that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the colors that come after it.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the presence of the nonce word ""bluf"" dictates that the output color will be the same as the color outputted for the word immediately preceding ""bluf"". Here are how the examples support this rule:

1. In ""wif bluf dax walm"", ""wif"" translates to ""red"", and the immediate output after ""bluf"" is also ""red"". ""Dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""walm"" does not have a translation, but the pattern remains consistent with ""bluf"" causing a repeat of the previous color.

2. ""Dax bluf"" results in ""green green"", which again supports that ""bluf"" causes a repetition of the color associated with ""dax"" (green).

3. ""Dax bluf wif zup dax"" gives ""green green red yellow green"", where ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (green) and the output is again ""green"", which is a repetition of the color associated with the word before it.

4. ""Zup lug bluf"" leads to ""yellow blue blue"". In this instance, ""lug"" has an output of ""blue,"" and the immediate output after ""bluf"" is also ""blue"".

5. In ""zup bluf,"" the output ""yellow yellow"" confirms the pattern once more, as ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow.""

Therefore, based on the evidence from the examples, the rule for ""bluf"" is:

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color of the word immediately before it.
From examining the provided examples, it is possible to deduce a rule for what 'walm' contributes to the output:

1. In the first example, the sequence ""dax walm zup walm"" corresponds to ""green green green yellow yellow yellow."" Since ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""zup"" also precedes ""walm,"" we can associate that ""walm"" translates to a repeated color sequence of the word that comes before it.

2. In the second example, ""lug walm wif lug"" gives us ""blue blue blue red blue."" Here, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" again implies a repetition of the color tied to ""lug"" which is blue.

3. The third example, ""zup wif walm lug,"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue."" The word ""wif"" comes before ""walm,"" and the output is ""red red red,"" which supports the idea of ""walm"" causing repetition of the color that is associated with the preceding word.

4. In the fourth example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" reinforcing the idea that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color corresponding to the preceding word, which is ""yellow"" for ""zup.""

5. In the last example, ""dax walm zup lug"" becomes ""green green green yellow blue."" ""Dax"" leads to a tripled ""green"" output because of ""walm,"" and then the sequence moves to the next word, ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" without repetition (since ""walm"" specifically repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it).

Therefore, based on these observations, the rule for 'walm' seems to be:

Rule: 'walm' -> Causes the preceding word's associated color to be repeated three times.

Now to write the answer following the requested format:

walm -> Causes the preceding word's associated color to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,65
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the word ""lug"" seems to be associated with the color ""blue."" Every time ""lug"" is used in the input, ""blue"" is part of the corresponding output.

Here are the specific observations:

- ""dax lug"" translates to ""green blue."" Here lug corresponds to blue.
- ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red."" Here lug corresponds to the first color, which is blue.
- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue."" Lug is the first word, and the first color in the output is blue.
- ""lug dax lug wif"" translates to ""blue green blue red."" Here, both instances of lug correspond to blue.
- ""lug dax"" translates to ""blue green."" Again, lug corresponds to blue.

Given the examples, the following rule can be induced:

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the nonce word 'dax' corresponds to the color 'green'. The presence of other words changes the sequence of colors, but 'dax' consistently maps to 'green'.

Here is the inferred association:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red

Rule: When 'dax' appears in an input, it translates to the color 'green' in the output. The other words in the examples - 'zup', 'lug', and 'wif' - seem to correspond to 'yellow', 'blue', and 'red', respectively.
Considering the examples provided, it seems that each nonce word corresponds to a color in the output. The word ""wif"" appears in each input and consistently translates to ""red"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the given examples, we observe that whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output at the same position. Regardless of other words around it, ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow"". Other words in the input also seem to map to specific colors:

- lug -> blue
- bluf -> red
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- walm -> yellow

Using the information above, we deduce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we should look at the correlation between its appearance in the input and the corresponding output.

Here’s what we observe:

1. wif bluf zup bluf wif -> red red yellow yellow red
2. wif zup dax bluf -> red yellow green green
3. wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> red blue blue yellow yellow green
4. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
5. zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue

From these examples, we notice that whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, the color in the output repeats the color that was just before it. 

1. The output contains ""red red"" and ""yellow yellow,"" and each pair follows an instance of ""bluf.""
2. ""green green"" follows a ""bluf.""
3. ""blue blue"" and ""yellow yellow"" follow a ""bluf.""
4. ""red red"" follows a ""bluf.""
5. ""yellow yellow"" follows a ""bluf.""

Based on these observations, we can infer the rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> repeat the previous color in the output.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in each input and output pair with a focus on when the word ""walm"" is used:

1. Input: ""zup walm"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is three repetitions of ""yellow.""

2. Input: ""lug walm zup lug walm"" -> Output: ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue""
- ""walm"" follows ""lug"" resulting in ""blue blue blue,"" and ""walm"" follows ""zup"" resulting in ""yellow.""

3. Input: ""lug walm zup wif"" -> Output: ""blue blue blue yellow red""
- Again ""walm"" follows ""lug"" for ""blue blue blue,"" and after ""zup"" there's no ""walm,"" leading to no ""yellow"" repetition.

4. Input: ""dax walm wif bluf"" -> Output: ""green green green red red""
- ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" giving ""green green green.""

5. Input: ""dax walm lug"" -> Output: ""green green green blue""
- ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" resulting in ""green green green.""

From these patterns, it seems that the word ""walm"" could indicate a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes directly before it. Here's a more specific rule based on the data:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times.

- ""zup"" seems to be associated with the color ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" seems to be associated with the color ""blue.""
- ""dax"" seems to be associated with the color ""green.""

Therefore, when the word ""walm"" is used after any of these words, it causes the output to be three repetitions of the respective color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,66
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, lug seems to correspond to the output ""blue."" However, this correspondence is not absolute, as lug's presence doesn't always output a single instance of ""blue."" When lug is followed by certain words, it seems to modify the number of times ""blue"" appears. To deduce the rule more precisely, let's look at each example:

1. ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" results in ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow."" After ""lug,"" ""zup"" leads to ""blue yellow,"" and ""walm"" changes from ""red"" to ""yellow."" ""Lug"" seems to change the color associated with the word following it.

2. ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" results in ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue."" Again, after ""lug,"" the color change pattern occurs twice: ""walm"" changes to ""blue,"" and the next occurrence of ""lug"" also outputs ""blue."" Since ""dax"" precedes this last ""lug"" and correlates to ""green,"" it seems this ""lug"" doesn't modify the color associated with ""dax"".

3. ""lug"" on its own corresponds to a single ""blue.""

4. ""lug walm zup walm"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow."" After the first ""lug,"" we see a tripling of ""blue,"" and after ""zup,"" a tripling of ""yellow,"" suggesting that ""lug"" might have caused a tripling effect for the following sequences.

5. ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" yields ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow."" Here, ""lug"" does not seem to modify ""wif"" directly as the sequence ""red red red yellow"" is consistent with prior examples, but the ""blue"" follows ""lug"" immediately.

Given the information, ""lug"" seems to produce ""blue"" when standing alone. When followed by another word, ""lug"" seems to produce a ""blue"" and may change or repeat the output pattern for the following word(s), often tripling the color associated with the next word that would have been produced without ""lug"" being present. However, without information on what each word (like ""wif,"" ""walm,"" and ""zup"") is supposed to correspond to specifically, and without a clear rule for when ""lug"" triples the output or not, providing a more detailed rule is challenging.

Rule: lug alone -> blue. When followed by another word, lug modifies the pattern of output colors, often leading to a repeating/tripling effect of the subsequent color(s).
Based on the input and output examples provided, we can determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"". 

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" when it follows ""lug wif"" which correspond to ""blue red"".
- In the second example, ""dax"" again corresponds to the color ""green"" when it follows ""zup wif lug"" which correspond to ""yellow red blue"".
- In the third and fourth examples, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position.
- In the fifth example where ""dax"" is the only word in the input, the output is still ""green"".

From these observations, we can deduce that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. 

Rule: dax -> green
Examining the given inputs and their corresponding outputs, it is evident that each unique word in the input is associated with a specific color in the output. By comparing the positions of the words in the inputs with the positioning of colors in the outputs, we can deduce the following associations:

- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow
- dax -> green
- walm -> green

Now, we must determine what ""wif"" means based on its placement and the resulting color in the output. Analyzing each example:

1. lug zup wif --> blue yellow red
2. wif zup bluf --> red yellow yellow
3. zup wif --> yellow red
4. dax walm wif dax --> green green green red green
5. wif bluf dax --> red red green

From these examples, it is clear that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of its position. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the examples provided, every instance of the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence or the other words around it, the output consistently translates ""zup"" to ""yellow.""
bluf -> meaning. The meaning appears to be a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it. 

Rule: If a word is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is the color corresponding to the word, repeated twice. 

For example:
- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
Looking at the provided examples, let's analyze the outputs in correlation with the presence of the nonce word ""walm"":

1. lug zup dax walm -> blue yellow green green green
2. zup walm dax -> yellow yellow yellow green
3. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
4. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red
5. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow

Taking ""walm"" as a variable in the sequences, the outputs before and after ""walm"" suggests that ""walm"" somehow influences the colors that follow it. More precisely, it seems that walm causes the subsequent outputs to repeat the color that directly precedes it until a new color is introduced. Here are the observations:

- In the first example, the color green (preceded by ""dax"") is repeated three times after ""walm"".
- In the second example, the color yellow (preceded by ""zup"") is repeated twice after ""walm"".
- In the third example, the color red (preceded by ""wif"") is repeated twice after ""walm"", until ""lug"" changes the output to blue.
- In the fourth example, the color green (preceded by ""dax"") is repeated twice after ""walm"", until ""bluf"" changes it to red.
- In the fifth example, the color red (preceded by ""wif"") is repeated twice after ""walm"", until ""zup"" changes it to yellow.

Based on the above observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be as follows:

Rule: walm -> Causes the next output to repeat the color of the word that directly precedes it, continuing this pattern until a new color is introduced (associated with a new word).

Thus, the meaning of ""walm"" in this context is: Repeat the preceding color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,67
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is associated with the color blue. Every time the word ""lug"" is mentioned in the input, the color ""blue"" is produced in the output.
From the examples provided, we can try to identify the pattern corresponding to the word ""dax"" and its position relative to the other words. Let's break down the input and output pairs:

1. Input: ""dax wif zup"" -> Output: ""green red yellow""
   - ""dax"" is followed by ""green"".
   
2. Input: ""zup dax walm lug wif"" -> Output: ""yellow green green green blue red""
   - Here ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" again.
   
3. Input: ""dax wif lug"" -> Output: ""green red blue""
   - Once more, ""dax"" is followed by ""green"".

4. Input: ""lug dax zup lug wif"" -> Output: ""blue green yellow blue red""
   - ""dax"" follows ""blue"" and precedes ""green"".
   
5. Input: ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" -> Output: ""red red blue green red""
   - ""dax"" is preceded by ""blue"" and followed by ""green"".

With these observations, we can see that each occurrence of ""dax"" is consistently associated with the color ""green"" in the output, irrespective of position or surrounding words. There is no deviation in this pattern, which allows us to formulate the following rule:

Rule: dax -> ""green""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" However, there is not enough variation in the surrounding context to determine if ""wif"" means ""red"" in all contexts or if it is conditional on the position or other words. The current examples show ""wif"" always resulting in the output ""red,"" regardless of its position or surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input or the presence of other words. Thus, the rule can be stated as:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Each instance of the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
Rule: bluf -> the color of the preceding word. 

In each instance, ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it:

- ""dax lug bluf dax"" -> The word before ""bluf"" is ""lug"", which corresponds to blue; hence ""bluf"" is blue. ""Dax"" is green, so the pattern is: green blue blue green.
- ""wif bluf"" -> The word before ""bluf"" is ""wif"", which corresponds to red; hence ""bluf"" is red. The pattern is: red red.
- ""lug dax bluf"" -> The word before ""bluf"" is ""dax"", which corresponds to green; hence ""bluf"" is green. The pattern is: blue green green.
- ""wif bluf dax"" -> The word before ""bluf"" is ""wif"", which corresponds to red; hence ""bluf"" is red. The following word is ""dax"", which is green, leading to the pattern: red red green.
- ""dax bluf zup"" -> The word before ""bluf"" is ""dax"", which corresponds to green; hence ""bluf"" is green. The word after ""bluf"" is ""zup"", which corresponds to yellow, resulting in the pattern: green green yellow.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" affects the output by repeating the color associated with the word that precedes it. Each instance of 'walm' in the input results in the repeated occurrence of the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it.

Let's review the examples to validate this rule:

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   'Zup' corresponds to 'yellow', followed by 'walm', which repeats 'yellow' two more times.

2. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   'Dax' corresponds to 'green', followed by 'walm', which repeats 'green' two more times after the original 'green'.

3. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   'Wif' corresponds to 'red', followed by 'walm', which repeats 'red' two more times.

4. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   'Zup' corresponds to 'yellow', with 'walm' causing 'yellow' to repeat, and 'wif' corresponds to 'red'.

5. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   'Dax' followed by 'walm' repeats 'green', then 'wif' corresponds to 'red' followed by 'walm' which repeats 'red', and 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'.

This pattern holds in all other examples given, so we can conclude that the word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"" to be repeated two more times.

Rule: Walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,68
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following color associations for each word:

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow

The word ""dax"" appears to always result in the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the meaning of ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

dax -> green

Rule: When the word ""dax"" appears, output the color ""green"".
Based on the examples provided, each instance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output. Here are the patterns that I have noticed:

1. ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
2. ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
3. ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
4. ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red,"" regardless of its position in the list.
5. Other words such as ""bluf"" and ""walm"" have translations based on their component letters or positions, but ""wif"" does not seem to follow a complex pattern.

Thus, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be very straightforward:

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Evidence from examples:

- Input: wif dax zup -> Output: red green yellow (zup corresponds to yellow, as wif and dax align with red and green respectively)
- Input: zup lug -> Output: yellow blue (zup corresponds to yellow, and lug to blue)
- Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow (zup corresponds to yellow, and each occurrence of walm is also aligned with yellow)
- Input: zup walm dax -> Output: yellow yellow yellow green (zup and walm correspond to yellow, dax corresponds to green)
- Input: dax zup lug zup bluf -> Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow (dax corresponds to green, zup to yellow, and lug to blue; bluf is not explicitly matched but since it follows a zup which is yellow, it seems to correlate with another yellow)
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the patterns in the colors corresponding to the words before and after ""bluf.""

In the first example, ""zup dax bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow green green."" Here, ""dax"" comes before ""bluf"" and is associated with ""green."" ""Bluf"" also has ""green"" after it.

In the second and third examples, ""dax bluf"" consistently corresponds to ""green green,"" so ""dax"" is still green, and ""bluf"" is still green.

In the fourth example, ""lug wif bluf lug wif"" translates to ""blue red red blue red."" The pattern changes in that ""lug"" precedes and follows ""bluf"" and is followed and preceded by ""blue."" ""Wif"" precedes and follows ""bluf"" and is also associated with ""red."" However, the color for ""bluf"" remains consistent with ""red.""

In the fifth example, ""lug wif bluf"" maps to ""blue red red."" Both ""lug"" and ""wif"" precede ""bluf,"" and the colors ""blue"" and ""red"" come before ""red,"" the color for ""bluf.""

Upon inspecting these patterns, it appears that ""bluf"" consistently corresponds with the color ""red"" regardless of the context provided by the other words in the sequence.

Thus, the rule is: bluf -> red.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the relationship between the input strings and the corresponding output colors in these sequences. Let's examine the input and output pairs to identify patterns.

1. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue""
2. ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow""
3. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
4. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
5. ""lug wif dax walm zup"" -> ""blue red green green green yellow""

First, we notice that the other words (""lug"", ""bluf"", ""dax"", ""zup"", ""wif"") each directly translate to a specific color:

- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- ""bluf"" -> ""blue""
- ""dax"" -> ""green""
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- ""wif"" -> ""red""

Now, let's look at what happens with ""walm"":

- In example 1, ""walm"" precedes the color ""yellow"" and follows ""zup"" which is also ""yellow.""
- In example 2, ""walm"" is between ""wif"" (red) and ""dax"" (green), and the output is two ""red"" colors.
- In examples 3 and 4, ""walm"" directly follows ""lug"" (blue), and the output is an additional ""blue,"" totaling to three ""blue"" colors each time.
- In example 5, ""walm"" is between ""dax"" (green) and ""zup"" (yellow), and the output after ""dax"" is two additional ""green"" colors before ""zup"" (yellow).

Based on the patterns, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color of the word preceding it to be repeated once in the output (assuming there is a word before it to repeat). If ""walm"" is surrounded by the same word (color), such as in example 1 after ""zup"", it seems to create a sequence of that color. Thus, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be: repeat the color of the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup wif
    ",Output: yellow red,yellow red,True,69
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue"". The other words in the inputs, ""bluf"" and ""dax"", correspond to ""blue"" and ""green"" respectively, while ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". The rule appears to be a direct translation from the nonce word to a color name in English.

Rule: lug -> blue
Analyzing the input-output pairs, let's try to determine a pattern that associates ""dax"" with a particular meaning or rule.

Input: dax lug bluf dax Output: green blue blue green
Input: dax lug walm Output: green blue blue blue
Input: zup dax walm zup wif Output: yellow green green green yellow red
Input: dax wif Output: green red
Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

Looking at the first input-output pair:
- ""dax"" appears at the beginning and the end, and the associated colors are ""green"" at the beginning and the end of the output.
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""blue"".

Looking at the second input-output pair:
- ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green"" at the beginning of the output.
- ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue"", followed by ""walm"", which also corresponds to ""blue"".

Looking at the third input-output pair:
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the second position of the output.
- ""zup"" appears at the beginning and near the end, corresponding to ""yellow"" in the output, maintaining its position relative to the surrounding colors.

Looking at the fourth input-output pair:
- ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green"" at the beginning of the output. 
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Looking at the fifth input-output pair:
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" twice, matching its position in the input.
- Patterns for ""zup"" and ""walm"" are consistent with ""yellow"" and repeating the color it corresponds to (""yellow"" for ""zup"" and ""yellow"" for ""walm"") if it follows itself.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""dax"" appears to be independent of its position in the input sequence and is consistently translated to ""green"" in the output. Other words such as ""zup"", ""lug"", ""bluf"", ""walm"", and ""wif"" have their own associated colors that appear consistent across examples.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow each time it appears in the input.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" takes the color of whatever word comes before it. If there is no word before it, then ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word after it. Hence, in the context of colors following the word ""bluf"":

- ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue"" because ""lug"" outputs ""blue"" and ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word.
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"" because ""wif"" outputs ""red"" and ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word.
- ""dax bluf wif"" -> ""green green red"" because ""dax"" outputs ""green"" and ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word, with ""wif"" then contributing ""red.""
- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" outputs ""yellow"" and no word comes before ""zup,"" so ""bluf"" takes on the color of ""zup.""
- ""lug wif bluf lug wif"" -> ""blue red red blue red"" where the first ""bluf"" takes the color ""red"" from the preceding ""wif,"" and the pattern continues accordingly for the rest of the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> adopts the color of the preceding word; if there is no preceding word, it adopts the color of the following word.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to compare the inputs and outputs to identify patterns. Let's look at what happens in each example when the word ""walm"" is introduced.

1. wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

- Here, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" (blue), and the color following ""walm"" is also blue. The ""dax"" is green, which is different from the pattern we're focusing on, so let's move on to the next example to look for consistent patterns.

2. wif lug zup walm wif lug -> red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue

- ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and precedes ""wif"" (red), resulting in two yellows. Notably, following ""walm,"" the color output does not immediately proceed to the next color ""red"" that would correspond with ""wif"".

3. lug walm wif -> blue blue blue red

- Here, ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" (blue) and is followed by blue, maintaining the color of ""lug"" before changing to ""red"" for ""wif"".

4. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue

- ""walm"" occurs after ""wif"" (red) and the output for ""walm"" maintains red before changing to ""lug"" (blue).

5. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow

- ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) and the output for ""walm"" maintains red before switching to ""dax"" (green).

Based on these observations, ""walm"" seems to cause the color of the previous word to repeat before moving onto the next color.

Rule: walm -> causes repetition of the color corresponding to the word it follows in the list.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,70
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Given the examples, it appears that each instance of the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Let's examine the evidence to support this:

1. Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output. No matter the position of ""lug"" within the sequence (first, middle, or last), it is consistently associated with ""blue.""

2. In each instance where other non-lug words are present (wif, walm, dax, zup), they map to different colors (red, yellow, green, yellow), indicating that these words correspond to colors different from ""lug.""

3. In the second and third examples, the sequence ""dax lug"" and ""lug dax"" both provide a green followed by a blue and a blue followed by a green output, respectively. Thus supporting that ""dax"" specifically maps to ""green,"" while ""lug"" maps to ""blue"" irrespective of the order.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""lug"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to observe its pattern of occurrence and the corresponding output in the given examples.

1. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
2. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
3. Input: dax lug
   Output: green blue
4. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red
5. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow

From Example 3, we can see that ""dax lug"" corresponds to ""green blue."" Therefore, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" This is consistent in all examples where ""lug"" always maps to ""blue,"" whereas ""dax"" always maps to ""green.""

Let's check ""dax"" with other words: in Example 4, ""dax wif"" maps to ""green red,"" suggesting ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" which is also consistent across examples.

Finally, in Example 5, ""dax walm wif zup"" maps to ""green green green red yellow,"" here, ""dax"" is the first word again, and it maps to ""green."" We can also notice that ""walm"" and ""wif"" map to ""green"" and ""red,"" respectively, which further confirms that ""dax"" on its own maps to ""green.""

Conclusion:
dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, we can analyze each instance where ""wif"" appears and the corresponding output to try to determine its meaning.

1. In ""zup lug walm wif dax,"" the output is ""yellow blue blue blue red green."" ""Wif"" appears before ""dax,"" and the corresponding output is ""red green.""

2. In ""wif lug,"" the output is ""red blue."" ""Wif"" appears before ""lug,"" and the output leads with ""red.""

3. In ""wif dax zup bluf,"" the output is ""red green yellow yellow."" ""Wif"" is before ""dax"" and is associated with ""red green.""

4. In ""zup walm lug zup wif dax,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green."" Here, ""wif"" is again before ""dax"" and the output includes ""red green.""

5. In ""dax wif,"" the output is ""green red."" ""Wif"" follows ""dax,"" and the corresponding colors are ""green red"" in reverse order.

From these examples, we can observe that the presence of ""wif"" before a word seems to always result in ""red"" preceding the color associated with the following word. When ""wif"" follows a word, as in the last example, the usual color order is inverted. Further, when ""wif"" is paired with ""dax,"" it is consistently associated with ""red green."" 

Since we only have one example where ""wif"" follows a word and multiple consistent examples where it precedes a word, we would lean towards the consistent behavior as a possible rule. Therefore, we might infer that ""wif"" denotes ""red"" before the color word that follows it. However, this is based on limited data provided in the examples, and there may be more complexity to the rule that we cannot see without additional examples.

Rule: When ""wif"" appears before another word, the color ""red"" is added before the color associated with the following word. If ""wif"" follows a word, it may invert the sequence of colors related to that word pair, but this is not certain without more examples.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to analyze the patterns in each input-output pair.

- In the first example, ""lug zup dax lug"" translates to ""blue yellow green blue."" Since ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" it appears that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

- The second example, ""zup bluf,"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" which supports the idea that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" regardless of what comes after it.

- In the third example, ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif"" maps to ""blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red."" It supports the pattern previously seen where ""zup"" is consistently followed by ""yellow"" in the output.

- The fourth example, ""dax wif zup dax,"" translates to ""green red yellow green."" ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and between them, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

- In the fifth example, ""wif zup lug dax zup walm,"" maps to ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow."" Again, every occurrence of ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" in the translation.

Based on these examples, it is consistent that ""zup"" always translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the context of the words around it.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Through analyzing the given examples, we can deduce that each nonce word corresponds to a color code. To determine what ""bluf"" means, we should look for patterns that associate ""bluf"" with specific colors in the output.

Input 1: ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" ""bluf"" appears at the end and translates to ""red red.""

Input 2: ""lug walm wif bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red red."" Here, ""bluf"" appears after ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red.""

Input 3: ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" translates to ""red blue blue red yellow."" ""Bluf"" is surrounded by ""lug"" and ""wif,"" corresponding to ""blue red.""

Input 4: ""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax"" translates to ""red blue blue yellow yellow green."" Here, ""bluf"" appears twice and translates differently depending on its position: once after ""lug"" as ""blue"" and once before ""dax"" as ""yellow.""

Input 5: ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red."" ""Bluf"" is at the end, after ""wif,"" and translates to ""red red.""

Based on the pattern in the examples, ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""red red"" when it follows ""wif"" and ""blue"" when it follows ""lug.""

Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to mean ""red"" when it follows ""wif"" and ""blue"" when it follows ""lug."" However, there is an inconsistency in Input 4, where ""bluf"" precedes ""dax"" and translates to a single ""yellow,"" which doesn't fit the established pattern. This could be an error or suggest that ""bluf"" has another contextual rule not fully defined by the given examples.

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" after ""wif,"" to ""blue"" after ""lug,"" and potentially to a different color in other contexts not fully exemplified here.
Based on the provided examples, walm seems to be a rule or function that applies a color to all preceding words based on the last word before it. Specifically, walm turns each preceding word into the color green if the last word is dax, blue if the last word is lug, red if the last word is wif, and yellow if the last word is zup.

Here's how the rule applies in each example:

- ""dax walm zup"" results in ""green green green yellow"" because walm changes each word before it to the color associated with the last word before walm (green for dax), but does not change zup (which is yellow).
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" because walm changes each word before it to the color associated with dax (green).
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" results in ""red red green green green"" because walm changes wif to red and bluf to red according to their set rule, and dax to green.
- ""wif lug walm"" results in ""red blue blue blue"" because walm changes wif to red and lug to blue. Since lug is the last word before walm, this suggests that lug's rule overrides that of wif in the sequence.
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" because walm changes each word before it to the color associated with zup (yellow).

Thus, the rule for walm seems to be: walm changes every word before itself into the color associated with the immediate word preceding it.

Rule: walm -> Changes all preceding words to the color associated with the last word before walm.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,71
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Every instance where the nonce word ""lug"" appears in the input, the color ""blue"" appears in the corresponding output position.
dax -> green

Rule: Each nonce word translates to a specific color. ""Dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in each example where it appears.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's examine the input-output pairs:

1. ""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red""
2. ""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green""
3. ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" -> ""red green red red yellow red""
4. ""dax wif dax"" -> ""green red green""
5. ""wif zup"" -> ""red yellow""

One way to approach this is to look for patterns in the translation from the input to the output. The word ""wif"" should correspond to the same word or concept in each output to maintain consistency.

Looking at each instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, it corresponds to ""red"" in the output.

1. zup -> yellow, wif -> red
2. wif -> red, dax -> green, bluf -> green
3. wif -> red, dax -> green, wif -> red, bluf -> red, zup -> yellow, wif -> red
4. dax -> green, wif -> red, dax -> green
5. wif -> red, zup -> yellow

Based on this pattern, it seems that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the word ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, the following observations can be made:

- ""zup"" appears to correspond to the color ""yellow"" each time it appears.
- Besides ""zup,"" other words appear to correspond to different colors:
  - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
  - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
  - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" but when preceding ""zup,"" it does not alter the output color for ""zup,"" which remains ""yellow.""

It's important to note that ""wif"" seems to be a special case because its output is ""red"" unless it directly precedes ""zup,"" in which case the output is ""red yellow."" When ""wif"" precedes other non-""zup"" words like ""dax"" or ""bluf,"" it does not output its color twice; instead, the latter word's color follows. 

Based on these observations, the rule for ""zup"" appears to be:

Rule: ""zup"" -> ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the surrounding words.
The nonce word ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the previous word. Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" or ""dax"", the color of the preceding word is repeated.

Rule:
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow (bluf repeats the color of zup, which is yellow)
- dax bluf -> green green (bluf repeats the color of dax, which is green)
- dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow (bluf repeats the color of zup, which is yellow)
- zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> yellow green green red yellow yellow blue (bluf repeats the color of dax, which is green)
- zup wif bluf zup lug -> yellow red red yellow blue (bluf repeats the color of wif, which is red)

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: repeat the color associated with the previous word.
Examining the given examples, let's look for patterns related to the occurrences of the nonce word ""walm"" and how they might correlate to the colors in the outputs:

1. In the first example, the sequence ""dax walm zup walm"" corresponds to ""green green green yellow yellow yellow."" Since ""dax"" is followed by three greens and is before ""walm,"" this could suggest ""dax"" contributes to the color green. The two occurrences of ""walm"" with no other words in between lead to three yellow outputs each time, suggesting ""walm"" might contribute to the color yellow.

2. In the second example, ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red."" Here, ""zup"" appears to correspond to yellow, ""wif"" to red, and the presence of ""walm"" results in red output following it.

3. The third example is similar to the first, ""dax walm wif walm"" leads to ""green green green red red red."" Again, ""dax"" precedes three greens, and ""wif"" seems to influence the color following it, turning it to red regardless of ""walm."" It appears that ""walm"" maintains the existing color generated by the word before it.

4. The fourth example, ""wif walm,"" corresponds to ""red red red."" Again, this follows the pattern that ""walm"" continues the color set by the preceding word.

5. In the last example, ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red."" We see ""zup"" leading to yellow, followed by ""walm"" that continues with yellow. Then, ""dax"" changes the pattern to green, followed by ""walm,"" which then maintains the yellow, indicating that ""walm"" again keeps the pattern set before it. However, the sequence ""dax zup dax"" breaks with an additional yellow before turning to green, so there might be more complexity here.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" likely extends the output sequence set by the preceding word. If ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" then ""walm"" after ""dax"" also leads to ""green."" If ""wif"" or ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output will be red or yellow, respectively.

Rule:
walm -> Extends the color sequence set by the preceding word. If the preceding word is ""dax,"" the output is green. If the preceding word is ""wif,"" the output is red. If the preceding word is ""zup,"" the output is yellow. If ""walm"" occurs after ""walm,"" it retains the color initiated by the word before the first ""walm.""


    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup dax
    ",Output: blue yellow green,blue yellow green,True,72
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples where the input and output are provided, we can apply rule induction to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug.""

In all given cases, whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output at the corresponding position:

Input: zup lug -> Output: yellow blue
Input: lug wif zup wif walm -> Output: blue red yellow red red red
Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
Input: zup lug zup bluf lug -> Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
Input: lug zup -> Output: blue yellow

From this, it is reasonable to deduce that ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words. There is no example showing ""dax"" translating to anything other than ""green,"" nor is there any indication that its meaning is influenced by context. Therefore:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" is consistently translated to the color ""red."" Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" affects the color mentioned after it. Specifically, every time ""zup"" is mentioned before another word, that word's corresponding color repeats until a new word follows ""zup"" with a different color. The color associated with ""zup"" itself is yellow. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""walm"" after ""zup"" yields a repetition of ""yellow"" until ""dax"" is followed by ""zup,"" after which ""dax"" turns green instead of its original color, which is green.

- In the second example, ""dax"" after ""zup"" results in ""yellow green.""

- In the third example, ""lug"" after ""zup"" results in four instances of the color blue (""yellow blue blue blue"").

- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup,"" then ""lug,"" which results in ""blue blue yellow blue.""

- In the fifth example, ""dax"" and ""walm"" after ""zup"" result in ""yellow green green green,"" suggesting that ""walm"" repeats the color green after ""zup dax.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""zup"" seems to be:

Rule: ""zup"" changes the output of the following word to repeated instances of that word's associated color, starting with yellow for ""zup"" itself until a new word not following ""zup"" appears or the sequence ends.

Therefore:

zup -> The word ""zup"" makes the following word repeat its associated color, and the word ""zup"" itself corresponds to the color yellow.
Observing the examples given and the corresponding outputs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule for the word bluf by analyzing how it changes the output in various positions. 

In the first example, bluf placed between wif and dax changes the output to ""red red green."" In the second example, bluf is placed after wif and before dax, and the output remains ""red green green,"" indicating that the position of bluf (either before or after dax) does not change the color associated with dax, which is always green. In the third example, when bluf is placed between zup and dax, the output is ""yellow yellow green,"" showing that zup corresponds to yellow whether it occurs before or after bluf. In the fourth example, when bluf is placed between dax and wif, the output is ""green green red,"" which shows again that the color for dax doesn't change (it is still green), and it suggests that bluf takes on the color of the word that comes before it. The fifth example, having an additional word walm, results in ""yellow yellow red red red,"" which maintains the pattern of bluf taking on the color of the word before it (yellow in this case), and showing the new word walm corresponds to the color red.

Based on these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: bluf takes on the color of the preceding word in the sequence. 

Hence:

bluf -> meaning. Rule: bluf takes on the color of the preceding word in the sequence.
Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" being repeated three times. In each example, every occurrence of ""walm"" is translated into ""yellow yellow yellow"". Also, we can deduce that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" based on their respective outputs. So, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the color ""yellow"" three times. 

As for ""lug,"" it is less clear from the examples, but in the only instance where ""lug"" has a direct output (""lug wif""), it corresponds to ""blue."" Thus, ""lug"" likely means ""blue"", but without more examples, the rule for ""lug"" might be less certain.

walm -> meaning. Meaning is the word ""yellow"" repeated three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif dax walm
    ",Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow,blue red green green green,False,73
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" we should look at the consistent patterns in which ""lug"" appears and the corresponding output colors.

From the examples we can infer the following:

1. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" because when ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red.""
2. ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"" because when ""walm"" appears, the output is ""yellow.""
3. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" because when ""zup"" appears, the output contains ""yellow.""
4. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" because when ""dax"" appears, the output contains ""green.""

Now let's focus on the examples with ""lug"":

- Example 1: when ""lug"" appears after ""wif walm zup,"" the output is ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow,"" but since ""wif"" and ""zup walm"" correspond to ""red"" and ""yellow yellow yellow"" respectively, we see an extra ""blue"" associated with ""lug."" 
- Example 2: with only ""lug walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue,"" which suggests ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and the repeated ""blue"" might indicate an intensification or repeat of the color output caused by ""lug.""
- Example 3: ""lug zup"" gives us ""blue yellow,"" so once again, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""
- Example 4: ""zup dax lug"" results in ""yellow green blue."" We know ""zup"" and ""dax"" correspond to ""yellow"" and ""green,"" so ""lug"" once again seems to correspond to ""blue.""
- Example 5: ""zup lug walm wif walm"" outputs ""yellow blue blue blue red red red,"" so again, ""lug"" aligns with ""blue,"" ""walm"" and ""wif"" with ""yellow"" and ""red"" respectively, the repetition of ""blue"" might indicate an intensification effect of ""lug,"" causing ""walm"" to output an extra ""blue"" instead of its usual ""yellow.""

From these patterns, we can infer that:

Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" When it precedes a word of a different color, it outputs ""blue"" once, and when it follows another color word, it seems to intensify or repeat the blue output.

lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green."" Here are the observations leading to this conclusion:

- In each Input where ""dax"" appears, the corresponding Output always contains ""green.""
- The position of ""dax"" within the Input sequence does not affect its Output translation, as it consistently maps to ""green"" regardless of whether it appears at the beginning, middle, or end of the sequence.

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" from the given examples, let's first look at each example to see if we can find a pattern.

1. ""dax zup walm wif walm"" results in ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red""
   - Here, ""wif"" falls between two instances of ""walm,"" which both correspond to the word ""yellow"". After ""wif"" is introduced, ""walm"" changes from yellow to red.

2. ""dax wif bluf"" results in ""green red red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green, then ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"", which both get the color ""red"".

3. ""dax bluf lug wif"" results in ""green green blue red""
   - ""wif"" comes at the end of the sequence, and it correlates to ""red"".

4. ""wif"" results in ""red""
   - Standing alone, ""wif"" results in ""red"".

5. ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" results in ""yellow red red yellow blue""
   - Between two instances of ""zup"", which corresponds to the color ""yellow"", ""wif"" and ""bluf"" both result in ""red"".

When we look for commonality, we see that every instance of ""wif"" leads to the color ""red"". In all five examples, regardless of which words come before or after ""wif"", the output for ""wif"" is always ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red

Meaning, the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" when translated to the output. Each instance where ""zup"" is used in the inputs directly translates to ""yellow"" in the outputs. Thus, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
From the provided examples, we can deduce the following:

1. In the first example, ""dax bluf zup bluf dax"" corresponds to ""green green yellow yellow green."" We can see that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" After ""bluf,"" the colors seem to repeat but shifted one step backward in the sequence.
   
2. In the second example, ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" maps to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" The word ""bluf"" here results in the word ""blue"" being introduced and then the word ""red"" is repeated.

3. The third example, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" maps to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" Again, the presence of ""bluf"" results in a ""red"" color appearing twice at the end.

4. The fourth example, ""wif bluf,"" leads to ""red red."" This indicates ""bluf"" has a connection to the color ""red,"" presumably duplicating it.

5. In the fifth example, ""dax zup bluf,"" we again see ""green yellow yellow."" It seems the word ""bluf"" results in repeating the color related to the word that comes before it.

Considering these observations, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated.

Based on this understanding, the meaning of ""bluf"" can be summarized as a function that duplicates the color associated with the word preceding it.

Therefore:

bluf -> repeats the color associated with the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the given examples, let's look at the patterns where ""walm"" appears:

1. wif lug zup walm wif lug -> red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   - After ""zup"" then ""walm,"" the color sequence is ""yellow yellow.""

2. wif walm dax -> red red red green
   - After ""wif"" then ""walm,"" we see an additional ""red"" before the pattern changes to ""green"" with ""dax.""

3. dax walm wif walm -> green green green red red red
   - After ""dax"" then ""walm,"" we observe additional ""green"" colors before changing to ""red"" with ""wif,"" and then another ""walm"" continues with ""red.""

4. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue
   - After ""lug"" then ""walm,"" additional ""blue"" colors appear before changing to ""red"" with ""wif.""

From these examples, we can infer that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color immediately preceding it. For example, if ""wif"" (red) precedes ""walm,"" we see a repetition of ""red.""

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax lug walm
    ",Output: yellow green blue blue blue,yellow green blue blue blue,True,74
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" appears in an input, the corresponding output includes the color ""blue.""
Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" is consistently associated with the color ""green."" The word ""lug"" following ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""blue,"" and the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" When the same word is repeated (""walm walm""), the corresponding color (""green"") is also repeated the same number of times. Then ""wif"" changes the pattern and adds three occurrences of the color ""red.""

Therefore, we can infer the following rules:

dax -> green
lug -> blue

And it seems likely that each word has a corresponding color, and when repeated, the corresponding color is also repeated the same number of times.

Rule:
- dax corresponds to the color green.
- When additional words are present, each one corresponds to a specific color. 
- The number of times a color is output corresponds to the number of times its corresponding word appears in sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" in the output:

- ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red"" (wif -> red)
- ""lug wif"" translates to ""blue red"" (wif -> red)
- ""zup dax zup wif"" translates to ""yellow green yellow red"" (wif -> red)
- ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" translates to ""blue green yellow green green green red"" (wif -> red)
- ""dax wif"" translates to ""green red"" (wif -> red)

Rule: wif -> red
Examining the given examples and their corresponding outputs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of ""zup"" by comparing the inputs and outputs.

1. In the first input, ""zup wif zup,"" the output is ""yellow red yellow,"" where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" at both occurrences.

2. In the second input, ""dax wif zup,"" the output is ""green red yellow,"" where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" once again.

3. In the third input, ""zup wif,"" the output is ""yellow red,"" with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow.""

4. In the fourth input, ""zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""zup"" corresponds to the first ""yellow"" and ""walm"" might correspond to a repetition rule that repeats the color before it, thus ""yellow yellow.""

5. In the last input, ""lug walm zup wif,"" the output is ""blue blue blue yellow red,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" seems to adhere to the repetition rule established earlier, repeating the same color ""blue,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

From these observations, the consistent meaning for ""zup"" in all examples is ""yellow."" Therefore, we can conclude:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to a color, and the specific color appears to be determined by the preceding word. Here is how ""bluf"" behaves in each input/output pair:

1. zup bluf -> yellow red. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" but ""bluf"" becomes ""red"" after ""zup.""
2. wif bluf -> red red. Here, we see ""bluf"" following ""wif"" also leads to ""red.""
3. wif bluf -> red red. Once again, after ""wif,"" ""bluf"" becomes ""red.""
4. lug bluf -> blue blue. Following ""lug,"" ""bluf"" yields ""blue.""
5. zup bluf -> yellow yellow. Following ""zup,"" ""bluf"" seems to yield ""yellow"" this time, which contradicts example 1.

There is an inconsistency in the fifth example compared to the first. However, ignoring the inconsistency and assuming there may be a typographical error in one of the examples, we could assume the rule is that ""bluf"" transforms into the color of the word that precedes it when it isn't 'wif'. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it results in ""red"" irrespective of what ""wif"" corresponds to. But to formulate a consistent rule based on the given data, we'll need to treat the discrepancy as a mistake. 

Ignoring the contradiction and assuming ""bluf"" should yield a color consistent with its preceding word unless the preceding word is ""wif,"" we can induce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word, with an exception of ""wif"" where ""bluf"" always translates to ""red.""
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the pattern of colors in the output corresponding to each input containing ""walm"":

1. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
2. lug walm -> blue blue blue
3. wif walm zup -> red red red yellow
4. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
5. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red

Looking at these patterns, we can see that every time ""walm"" is present in the input, the output ends with a repetition of the color assigned to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" Here is the correspondence between the nonce words and colors:

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> red or green (since it precedes 'dax' which is also 'green', it could be context-dependent or an error in the pattern)

Analyzing the Outputs:
1. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" so in this context ""walm"" seems to be duplicating the color of ""dax.""
2. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" so ""walm"" is duplicating the color of ""lug.""
3. ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" so ""walm"" duplicates the color of ""wif.""
5. ""wif walm"" at the end, again duplicates ""wif"" to result in ""red red red.""

Based on this, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it duplicates the color output of the word directly before it. The duplication is exactly three times regardless of how many times the preceding color appears.

Rule: walm -> duplicates the color of the word immediately before it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,75
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each provided example.
Rule: dax -> green

Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding output. This association is consistent across all examples provided.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" correlates to the color red in each output. The position of ""wif"" does not affect its output; regardless of its position in the input, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" Thus, we can deduce the following meaning:

wif -> red

Rule: In the context of these examples, the nonce word ""wif"" is translated to the color ""red"" every time it appears in the input.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we should look at the pattern of the colors corresponding to the inputs where ""zup"" is present.

- In the first example: after ""zup,"" all the following words are translated into colors with the word ""yellow"" until a different color (red) appears.
- In the second example: ""lug"" which is blue is followed by ""zup"" which translates to yellow.
- In the third example: ""zup"" is preceded by a red and followed by three yellows until a different color (red) is introduced.
- In the fourth example: ""zup"" is followed by yellow, with only one other word following it, which is also yellow.
- In the fifth example: ""zup"" is between blue and green, but it translates to yellow, and it does not affect the colors of the words around it.

From these examples, we can deduce that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" and its presence does not alter the colors represented by the other words before or after it. With this pattern, we can infer the meaning of ""zup"" as follows:

zup -> meaning. ""Zup"" means ""yellow"". Rule: When ""zup"" appears in the input, it is translated to ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, where ""bluf"" appears in a pattern alongside other words which correspond to specific colors in the output, it appears that ""bluf"" correlates with the color blue in English. Every time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" is included in the output in the same position.

Here is the observed pattern:

- ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue""
- ""wif bluf lug"" -> ""red red blue""
- ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue""
- ""lug bluf wif"" -> ""blue blue red""
- ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue""

The repetition of other words like ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue as well, so it's clear that ""bluf"" specifically means ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> blue
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the examples given.

1. ""zup walm wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow red."" Here, ""walm"" precedes the color ""yellow"" and is followed by a different color, ""red.""
   
2. ""dax zup dax walm"" translates to ""green yellow green green green."" ""Walm"" follows a sequence ""green yellow green"" and results in two additional ""green.""

3. ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" In this case, ""walm"" follows ""green blue"" and results in two more ""blue.""

4. ""zup dax lug walm zup"" translates to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow."" Here, ""walm"" comes after ""yellow green blue"" and leads to two more ""blue"" before ending with ""yellow.""

5. ""wif dax zup walm"" translates to ""red green yellow yellow yellow."" ""Walm"" follows a ""red green yellow"" sequence resulting in two additional ""yellow.""

From these examples, we can observe that ""walm"" appears to repeat the color word that immediately precedes it two more times.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color word that precedes it two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. 

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all the given examples.
Based on the examples provided, one possibility to consider is that the nonce word ""dax"" might not have a static meaning, instead, its meaning could be dependent on its position within a sequence of words. Let's analyze the position of ""dax"" and its corresponding output color in each input:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow
   - ""dax"" is the third word, its output is ""green.""

2. Input: dax -> Output: green
   - ""dax"" is the first and only word, its output is ""green.""

3. Input: wif dax bluf -> Output: red green green
   - ""dax"" is the second word, its output is ""green.""

4. Input: lug zup bluf dax -> Output: blue yellow yellow green
   - ""dax"" is the fourth word, its output is ""green.""

5. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   - ""dax"" is the sixth word, its output is ""green.""

Looking at these examples, we can notice that irrespective of its position, the output for ""dax"" is always ""green."" No other context seems to influence this output, since other words in different positions yield different colors, which suggests that the position does not affect the color of ""dax.""

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the output color ""green.""
Analyzing the output colors corresponding to the input words, we notice a pattern where each input word is consistently mapped to the same output color across all examples. Based on the given examples, here is the mapping:

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- walm -> repeated output of the subsequent color word (e.g., ""walm zup"" results in ""red red red yellow yellow yellow,"" which tripled the ""red"" that followed ""walm"" and doubled the ""yellow"" after ""zup"")

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red.""
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look at the outputs where ""zup"" occurs:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf zup"" turns into ""red red yellow."" Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

- In the second example, ""dax zup lug wif lug"" turns into ""green yellow blue red blue."" In this sequence, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" again.

- In the third example, ""zup bluf"" turns into ""yellow yellow."" The word ""zup"" is once more linked to the color ""yellow.""

- In the fourth example, ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" turns into ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow."" The word ""zup"" appears twice, and both times it corresponds to ""yellow.""

- In the fifth example, ""zup lug"" turns into ""yellow blue."" Here ""zup"" again corresponds to ""yellow.""

Across all examples, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, we can deduce that the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" is:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the provided input and output examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""bluf.""

The word ""bluf"" appears in each input and has a specific output pattern that can be matched to the position or context of ""bluf"" in the input sequence. Here are the patterns observed:

1) When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green.""
2) When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" regardless of whether it is immediately after or not, the output for ""bluf"" is always ""yellow.""
3) When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" or ""wif,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""red.""

Now let's isolate the instances of ""bluf"" and analyze:

- ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word preceding it, and since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""bluf"" also outputs ""green.""

- ""zup dax bluf zup dax"" results in ""yellow green green yellow green."" Here ""bluf"" maintains its ""green"" output as it follows ""dax."" Even when ""zup"" is present later in the sequence, the output for ""bluf"" is not affected, which indicates that the output for ""bluf"" is dependent on the word immediately preceding it.

- ""zup bluf"" gives us ""yellow yellow,"" which supports the aforementioned rule since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

- ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" outputs ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red."" Here, ""bluf"" produces ""blue"" following ""lug"" and again ""yellow"" following ""zup,"" confirming the rule that ""bluf"" takes the color of its preceding word.

- ""lug wif bluf"" results in ""blue red red,"" where ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red,"" in line with the idea that ""bluf"" echoes the color of the word right before it.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that the word ""bluf"" produces an output color that matches the color of the word that precedes it. If the preceding word outputs ""green,"" so does ""bluf,"" if the preceding word outputs ""yellow,"" so does ""bluf,"" and so on.

Rule: bluf -> Takes on the color output of the immediately preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" is not representing a fixed color or item by itself but rather it's repeating the color of the previous word.

Here are the patterns that guide this conclusion:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and ""lug"", which output ""red"" and ""blue"" respectively, and the output for ""walm"" is ""red red blue."" So, ""walm"" takes the color of the previously mentioned colors and repeats them.
  
- In the second example, ""zup wif dax walm lug"" results in ""yellow red green green green blue."" ""Walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is green, and the output for ""walm"" is ""green green."" Again, ""walm"" takes the color of the word before it and repeats it.
  
- The third example, ""dax zup walm wif walm,"" follows this same pattern. ""Walm"" appears twice, once after ""zup"" (yellow), leading to ""yellow yellow,"" and once after ""wif"" (red), leading to ""red red red.""
  
- In the fourth example, ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" so ""walm"" is repeating the color of ""zup"" (yellow) thrice.
  
- The fifth example, ""lug walm,"" yields ""blue blue blue,"" so again, ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug"" (blue) thrice.

With the above observations, we deduce the following:

walm -> Repeats the color of the immediately preceding word three times.

Rule: If the preceding word represents a color, then ""walm"" causes that color to be outputted three times in a row.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax
    ",Output: yellow green,yellow green,True,77
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Analyzing the provided examples, it seems that each occurrence of ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the outputs:

- In the first example, ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" leads to ""blue red red green blue blue"", and there are two instances of ""lug"" resulting in two instances of ""blue"" in the corresponding order.
- ""Lug dax"" translates to ""blue green"", with ""lug"" again resulting in ""blue"".
- In ""wif bluf dax lug"", the last word ""lug"" corresponds to the last color ""blue"".
- ""Wif zup lug dax zup walm"" outputs ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow"", with ""lug"" becoming ""blue"".
- Finally, ""lug zup lug"" becomes ""blue yellow blue"", where both instances of ""lug"" convert to ""blue"".

Rule: lug -> blue.
Rule: dax -> green

Every example involving the word ""dax"" always associates it with the output ""green."" Whether ""dax"" is at the beginning, middle, or end of the input sequence, the output ""green"" consistently follows it. The other words in the sequence correspond to their own unique colors, but ""dax"" reliably maps to ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. Here's how it works in the given examples:

- ""lug wif dax"" -> ""blue red green"" (wif corresponds to red)
- ""wif zup"" -> ""red yellow"" (wif corresponds to red)
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"" (wif corresponds to red)
- ""lug walm wif bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red red"" (wif corresponds to red)
- ""wif bluf lug zup"" -> ""red red blue yellow"" (wif corresponds to red)

Rule: wif -> red.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Each instance of the nonce word ""zup"" in the input corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
After analyzing the examples provided, it seems that the output color for the word ""bluf"" is directly influenced by the color that precedes it:

1. In the first example, bluf follows wif (red) and the output is red.
2. In the second example, it follows zup (yellow) first and then lug (blue), corresponding to the outputs yellow and blue respectively.
3. In the third example, it follows dax (green) and the output is green.
4. In the fourth example, it again follows lug (blue) and the output is blue.
5. In the fifth example, bluf is surrounded by wif (red) both times and the output is red both times.

From the data provided, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that its output color matches the color of the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the preceding word.
Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word(s) three times.

Explanation:
- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"", which implies that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""walm"" causes this color to be repeated three times.
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"", suggesting ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and again, ""walm"" repeats the color three times.
- ""lug walm dax"" results in ""blue blue blue green"", which implies ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"", ""walm"" repeats this color three times, and ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" once.
- ""wif lug walm"" leads to ""red blue blue blue"", showing that ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that appears right before it three times (in this case, ""lug"" which is ""blue"").
- ""lug walm"" gives ""blue blue blue,"" further confirming that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" repeats it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following color mappings:

- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- walm -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow

It seems that each nonce word is consistently mapped to the same color regardless of its position in the input sequence. The word ""lug"" always corresponds to the color blue, so the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

The provided examples consistently show that whenever the term ""dax"" is used in the input, it corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. There are no instances in the examples where ""dax"" corresponds to a different color or any other variable output, irrespective of its position in the sequence. Thus, the meaning of ""dax"" can be deduced as the color green.
To decipher the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we can examine the consistent patterns in the provided examples. Let's look at the outputs for each input that contains ""wif"":

1. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red
2. wif lug dax -> red blue green
3. dax wif -> green red
4. dax walm wif -> green green green red
5. zup dax wif -> yellow green red

Analyzing these examples, we can see that ""wif"" appears in different positions within the input sequences. Despite its position, the output always ends with the color ""red,"" while the other colors in the output correspond to other words such as ""zup,"" ""walm,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax."" Therefore, we can infer that ""wif"" does not affect the colors that represent other words, but it always introduces the color red at the end of the output sequence.

Thus, we can induce the following rule:

wif -> meaning: ""wif"" indicates that the color ""red"" should be added to the end of the sequence of colors.

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in an input sequence, append ""red"" to the end of the output color sequence.
zup -> yellow. The rule appears to be that 'zup' represents the color yellow regardless of the context in the given examples.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look at each instance and its corresponding output:

1. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red

2. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
   Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow

3. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

4. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green

5. Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
   Output: blue green green yellow blue red

Examining the outputs, the color that immediately follows each occurrence of ""bluf"" is ""red."" Even when ""bluf"" is followed by other nonce words like ""dax,"" ""wif,"" or ""zup,"" the color ""red"" still appears right after ""bluf,"" while the colors following other nonce words vary.

This suggests a rule where ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the repetition of the immediately preceding color word, with the number of repetitions corresponding to the position of ""walm"" in the sequence. 

We can verify this rule with the examples:

1. In the first sequence ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and since ""walm"" comes immediately after, we have ""blue"" repeated once because ""walm"" is the second word: blue blue blue.

2. In the second sequence ""zup walm dax zup dax wif,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times because it is the third word in the sequence, followed by the normal sequence of translations for ""dax zup dax wif"": yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red.

3. In the third sequence ""zup wif dax walm lug,"" we see ""dax"" which translates to ""green."" Since ""walm"" is the fourth word in this sequence, ""green"" is repeated four times: yellow red green green green blue.

4. The fourth sequence ""dax lug dax lug walm"" ends with ""lug"" which is ""blue,"" and since ""walm"" is the fifth word, ""blue"" is repeated four times (since it's already been mentioned once as ""lug,"" making a total of five blues): green blue green blue blue blue.

5. Finally, in the fifth sequence ""zup wif walm,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times because it's the third word in the sequence: yellow red red red.

Rule: ""walm"" causes the repetition of the preceding color word. The number of times the color is repeated is based on the position of ""walm"" in the sequence (not including the repetition caused by ""walm"").

So we have:

walm -> Causes the repetition of the previous color word in the sequence. The number of repetitions equals the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Every time the word ""lug"" appears, it is translated to the color ""blue.""
Based on the provided examples, each word seems to correspond to a specific color in the output. The colors are consistently associated with the same words across the different inputs. Analyzing each instance of ""dax"" in the inputs and their corresponding outputs, it seems that ""dax"" always results in the color ""green.""

Here is the breakdown of each example to explain the rule:

- ""zup dax bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow green green""; ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""dax lug"" corresponds to ""green blue""; ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""lug dax lug"" corresponds to ""blue green blue""; again, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""dax zup dax"" corresponds to ""green yellow green""; ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""dax lug dax lug wif"" corresponds to ""green blue green blue red""; ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

The consistent output color for ""dax"" across all these examples is ""green."" Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

dax -> green. The meaning of ""dax"" is the color green. Rule: Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's analyze the examples given:

1. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"": Here, ""bluf"" consistently appears to translate to ""red."" Since both words translate to the same color, it is possible that ""wif"" also translates to ""red.""

2. ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" -> ""green green red yellow red"":
- ""dax"" appears before a ""green""
- ""bluf"" appears before a second ""green""
- One ""wif"" appears before ""yellow"" and one before ""red"" (we know ""wif"" isn't ""yellow"" since ""zup"" appears before ""yellow"").

3. ""wif zup dax"" -> ""red yellow green"":
- ""wif"" appears before ""red""
- ""zup"" appears before ""yellow""
- ""dax"" appears before ""green""

4. ""dax wif zup"" -> ""green red yellow"":
- ""dax"" appears before ""green""
- ""wif"" appears before ""red""
- ""zup"" appears before ""yellow""

5. ""dax wif"" -> ""green red"":
- ""dax"" appears before ""green""
- ""wif"" appears before ""red""

By analyzing the pattern where ""wif"" appears and the resulting color, ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" The presence of ""wif"" in an input always leads to the word ""red"" in the corresponding output.

Rule: wif -> red.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we analyze the given examples and consider the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow

2. Input: zup wif lug
   Output: yellow red blue

3. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow

4. Input: zup dax
   Output: yellow green

5. Input: zup dax lug zup
   Output: yellow green blue yellow

From the examples, we can observe the following patterns:
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""

Additionally, when ""zup"" appears:
- In example 1, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In example 2, ""zup"" as the first word corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In example 3, ""zup"" in the second position also corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In example 4, ""zup"" as the first word corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In example 5, ""zup"" appears both as the first and the last word and corresponds to ""yellow.""

It is thus evidenced that the position of ""zup"" in the sequence does not alter its corresponding output color. ""Zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow,"" irrespective of its position among the other words.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the pattern of the given examples and their respective outputs:

1. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red
2. dax bluf wif zup wif -> green green red yellow red
3. wif bluf lug dax wif -> red red blue green red
4. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> blue blue red blue red red blue
5. lug bluf -> blue blue

The word ""bluf"" appears in these sequences alongside other nonce words. Each of these nonce words correlates with a color in the output sequence. However, the color related to ""bluf"" is not consistent across the examples and is not a straightforward one-to-one mapping with a specific color in all contexts.

By examining the output when ""bluf"" appears, we can discern that the rule is not directly correlated to a static color. Instead, the color before each ""bluf"" output changes depending on the word preceding it (with the exception of the first example where ""bluf"" is at the end, yet still produces ""red"").

From the given examples, it's apparent that the rule indicates that ""bluf"" signals repeating the color associated with the word directly before it, but with a twist. It is always followed by ""red"" regardless of the color it duplicates, except when it is at the end of the sequence, as seen in the first example.

Thus, the rule induced for ""bluf"" appears to be:

bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""bluf,"" and then add ""red"" afterward.

However, if ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence, there is no trailing red. Therefore, we can refine the rule to:

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a nonce word, the output is the color corresponding to that word followed by ""red."" If ""bluf"" is the final word in the sequence, the output is only the color corresponding to the word that comes before it without ""red.""
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns of input and corresponding output:

1. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red
2. dax walm wif walm -> green green green red red red
3. zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red
4. lug dax walm -> blue green green green
5. lug walm -> blue blue blue

In each line, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word preceding it, forming extra ""red"" in the sequence. In the first and third examples, ""zup"" outputs ""yellow"" and is followed by a ""walm,"" which results in additional ""yellow"" outputs before finishing with ""red."" Similarly, in the second example, ""dax"" outputs ""green"" and is followed by ""walm,"" which leads to more ""green"" outputs before finishing with ""red."" The word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the last mentioned color word and finally ends with a red. This pattern is confirmed by the fourth and fifth examples.

Given these observations, we can write:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it multiple times (three in the observed cases) and ends the sequence with ""red.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,80
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
Analyzing the given examples:

1. lug zup bluf dax -> blue yellow yellow green
2. lug zup dax lug dax -> blue yellow green blue green
3. zup walm dax lug -> yellow yellow yellow green blue
4. wif dax wif -> red green red
5. wif dax lug dax -> red green blue green

The word ""dax"" always corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs, regardless of its position in the input list or the words that surround it.

Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" is: 

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, we can observe the following patterns:

1. Every segment of the input that is not ""wif"" is translated into a color:
   - zup -> yellow
   - dax -> green
   - walm -> yellow
   - lug -> blue

2. The output is symmetric around the occurrences of ""wif"":
   - In the first example, the pattern ""zup dax walm zup"" is mirrored around ""wif"" as ""yellow green green green yellow"" and then followed by ""red"". 
   - Similarly, the second example ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" produces a symmetrical pattern around ""wif"", with an additional ""red"" after the first ""wif"" and another ""blue"" at the end.
   - In the third example, there are only two terms, with ""wif"" leading to ""red"", followed by ""zup -> yellow"".

3. The symmetrical pattern breaks when an input ends or begins with ""wif"":
   - In the fourth example ""dax zup lug wif zup"", ""wif"" appears at the end, leading to ""red"" followed by ""yellow"" which mirrors ""zup"" that came just before ""wif"". The word ""lug"" does not have an element to mirror so it stands alone as ""blue"".
   - The fifth example ""zup lug wif dax lug"" again shows ""wif"" causing symmetry with ""red"" followed by ""green"" to mirror ""dax"", but the final ""lug"" stands on its own as ""blue"" without a mirror.

From these patterns, we can infer that ""wif"" acts as a mirror point for the colors indicated by the other words, and when ""wif"" is at the beginning or the end, it becomes ""red"" without a requirement for symmetry. It also seems that each word pair across ""wif"" gets translated in symmetrical order, except for single occurrences like ""lug"" at the end of examples 4 and 5.

Rule: The word ""wif"" commands a behavior that creates symmetry in the surrounding words' output colors. When ""wif"" appears at the beginning of the sequence, it translates to ""red"". When it's not the first word, ""wif"" is directly followed by the color equivalent to the immediate prior word, resulting in a symmetrical pattern about ""wif"". This rule doesn't apply to words without a mirror, as seen with ""lug"" in the 4th and 5th examples.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we must find a pattern in how it influences the output. 

From the input/output pairs, we have:

1. lug walm wif zup wif -> blue blue blue red yellow red
2. lug zup -> blue yellow
3. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
4. wif dax zup dax -> red green yellow green
5. lug zup -> blue yellow

Considering examples 2 and 5, which are identical, ""lug zup"" always results in ""blue yellow."" In these cases, ""lug"" alone would be ""blue,"" indicating ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

In example 3, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which suggests ""walm"" might also mean ""yellow,"" and ""zup"" retains the meaning ""yellow.""

In example 1, ""lug walm wif zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue red yellow red."" Here, ""zup"" seems to translate to ""yellow,"" just like in examples 2 and 5.

In example 4, ""wif dax zup dax"" converts to ""red green yellow green,"" which again suggests that ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" regardless of what ""dax"" signifies.

The rule that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" is consistent across all given examples.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we have to look for patterns in each example:

1. dax bluf wif -> green green red
2. zup lug zup lug zup bluf -> yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
3. zup bluf wif -> yellow yellow red
4. lug bluf zup -> blue blue yellow
5. wif dax bluf -> red green green

Based on the outputs, we see that the word preceding ""bluf"" dictates its color:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color is green.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color is yellow.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color is blue.
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color is red.

Therefore, ""bluf"" takes the same color as the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word immediately before it.
Reviewing the input and corresponding output examples provided, we can try to identify a consistent rule that describes what the nonce word walm means in the context of the outputs:

- Example 1: ""wif zup walm dax zup"" results in ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow"". Here, walm is followed by dax and preceded by zup, which both yield 'yellow' after walm, with 'green' after dax.
  
- Example 2: ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"". Here, walm is preceded by zup and is not followed by anything, yet it generates multiple 'yellow' outputs.

- Example 3: ""zup walm wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow red"". Again, walm is preceded by zup, and followed this time by wif, yielding 'red' after the sequence of 'yellow'.

- Example 4: ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"". Here, walm is preceded by lug, with each yielding 'blue'.

- Example 5: ""dax wif walm lug zup"" results in ""green red red red blue yellow"". In this case, walm is preceded by wif, followed by lug, resulting in 'red' before it and 'blue' after it.

From these observations, we can infer a pattern relating to the word ""walm"":

- When the word ""walm"" appears in an input, it causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"" for as many times as ""walm"" is repeated itself (which in all provided examples is once). 

Now, let's extract the rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" generates a sequence of the output colors identical to the color associated with the immediately preceding word in the input. The length of this sequence is the same as the number of times ""walm"" appears in a row.

So, to put it in a formula:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the output color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" for the number of times ""walm"" appears consecutively.

Example: In the input ""zup walm wif"", ""zup"" is associated with the color 'yellow', and since ""walm"" follows, it repeats the color 'yellow' the number of times ""walm"" is written, which in this case is once.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,81
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, each word seems to correspond to a specific color:

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- walm -> blue (repeated to indicate multiple blue units)
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> blue

In each example where ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue"" regardless of its position or other words around it. Therefore, ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue.

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the examples provided:

- When ""dax"" appears alongside ""walm"" and ""lug,"" the output is ""green green green blue"" indicating that ""dax,"" ""walm,"" and ""lug"" correspond to ""green"" in that order, with ""lug"" also capable of being ""blue"" in the second position.
- When ""lug"" comes first and ""dax"" second, followed by ""zup,"" the output is ""blue green yellow,"" which means that the position of ""dax"" after ""lug"" results in ""green"" again.
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green,"" confirming that ""dax"" maps to ""green"" and also suggesting ""bluf"" maps to ""green"".
- When ""dax"" is alone, the output is still ""green,"" indicating that the meaning of ""dax"" does not depend on other words around it.
- When ""zup,"" ""walm,"" and ""dax"" are in sequence, the output is ""yellow yellow yellow green,"" which confirms that ""dax"" consistently results in ""green"" no matter its position in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green. ""Dax"" consistently maps to the word ""green,"" regardless of its position or the other words around it.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color 'red' in the output every time it appears in the input.

Therefore, the rule appears to be: wif -> red

Rule: Whenever 'wif' is present in the input, the output is 'red'.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's identify the pattern of colors associated with each unique word across the examples:

- ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red.""
- ""zup"" maps to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" maps to ""green.""
- ""lug"" maps to ""blue.""

Now, let's focus on examples containing ""bluf"":

1. ""wif zup bluf"" -> ""red yellow yellow""
   - Here, ""bluf"" generates the same color as the word preceding it (""zup"" -> ""yellow"").

2. ""dax bluf lug wif"" -> ""green green blue red""
   - Again, ""bluf"" generates the same color as the previous word (""dax"" -> ""green"").

3. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
   - ""bluf"" duplicates the color of the preceding word (""dax"" -> ""green"").

4. ""dax lug bluf wif"" -> ""green blue blue red""
   - ""bluf"" once more duplicates the color from ""lug"" (""blue"").

5. ""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax"" -> ""red blue blue yellow yellow green""
   - As before, each instance of ""bluf"" matches the color of the preceding word.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it duplicates the color of the word before it. Thus:

Bluf -> meaning. Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the same assigned color as the word before it in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" leads to the output of a series of the same color. The number of times the color is repeated corresponds to the number of syllables in the preceding word. Here are the observations that lead to this conclusion:

- ""wif walm"" (1 syllable in ""wif"") leads to ""red red red"" (3 repetitions of ""red"")
- ""zup lug walm"" (1 syllable in ""lug"") leads to ""yellow blue blue blue"" (3 repetitions of ""blue"")
- ""zup walm"" (1 syllable in ""zup"") leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"" (3 repetitions of ""yellow"")
- ""wif dax lug walm"" (1 syllable in ""lug"") leads to ""red green blue blue blue"" (3 repetitions of ""blue"")
- ""lug walm zup walm"" (1 syllable in ""zup"") leads to ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow"" (3 repetitions of ""blue"" followed by 3 repetitions of ""yellow"" for the second ""walm"")

It also seems that the color output for ""walm"" is influenced by the word directly preceding it, with each distinct word apparently mapping to a specific color:

- ""wif"" precedes ""red""
- ""zup"" precedes ""yellow""
- ""lug"" precedes ""blue""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

""walm"" -> the output is a repetition of the color corresponding to the directly preceding word, repeated three times.

Rule: If the word before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red""; if it is ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow""; if it is ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug
    ",Output: red blue,red blue,True,82
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the output color ""blue"" consistently appears after the nonce word ""lug"". No other color is directly associated with ""lug"" in any of the given inputs. Here's the pattern I see:

- After ""lug walm"", the output is ""blue blue"".
- After ""lug"" on its own, the output is ""blue"".
- After ""zup wif lug"", the output sequence includes ""red blue"".
- In sequences where ""lug"" appears multiple times, such as ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"", each instance of ""lug"" is followed by ""blue"".
- When paired with another word not followed by ""wif"", such as ""dax lug"", the output is ""green blue"", with ""blue"" following ""lug"".

Rule: lug -> blue

This suggests the rule that the word ""lug"" directly translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"". Here is the evidence from the examples:

- When ""dax lug wif"" is input, the output is ""green blue red"", and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red"" in other examples.
- In ""zup dax lug"", the output is ""yellow green blue"". We can see from other examples that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"", leaving ""dax"" to correspond with ""green"".
- For the input ""dax wif"", the output is ""green red"", and previously we've seen ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", suggesting ""dax"" is ""green"".
- With ""zup wif zup dax"", the output is ""yellow red yellow green"". We've already established that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red"", which leaves ""dax"" corresponding to ""green"".
- Lastly, ""wif dax wif"" gives an output of ""red green red"", and since we've consistently seen ""wif"" as ""red"", ""dax"" in the middle must be ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" consistently. Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding output position.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the output consistently assigns the color yellow to the input ""zup."" No other word receives this consistent treatment; thus, we can induce that the word ""zup"" directly translates to the color yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the given examples, we can draw a correlation between the appearance of the word ""bluf"" and the corresponding output. In each instance, the presence of ""bluf"" results in the word ""red"" appearing in the output. 

The fact that ""bluf"" precedes ""red"" once, and ""red red"" twice, indicates that the word ""bluf"" is directly translated to ""red red"". 

Here are the examples with this rule applied:

- Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
  ""bluf"" translates to ""red red"". The appearance of ""wif"" does not affect this output; ""wif"" is not translated or is inert.  

- Input: wif bluf dax -> Output: red red green
  ""bluf"" translates to ""red red"" and ""dax"" adds a ""green"".  

- Input: wif dax zup bluf -> Output: red green yellow yellow
  Here, ""bluf"" at the end of the sequence also translates to ""red red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow yellow"".  

- Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
  ""bluf"" translates to ""red red"" but in this case, only ""yellow yellow"" is seen in the output.
  
Following this pattern, a discrepancy arises with the last example. It might suggest that ""zup bluf"" creates a case where ""bluf"" translates differently. However, since this is inconsistent with the other examples, it might be a typographical error or an exception to the rule for this specific combination. Without further information, it is hard to reach a concrete conclusion for the last case.

To make the rule consistent with the given information except for the last example, the rule could be:

Rule: bluf -> red red

However, if there is an exception or if there's a missing piece in the dataset for the last two examples ""zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow"", a different rule might need to be inferred or an error in the data acknowledged.
Based on the provided examples, we can try to infer the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""walm"".

Looking at all the inputs where ""walm"" appears, the outputs are:

1. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
2. zup walm dax zup dax wif -> yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
3. dax zup walm wif -> green yellow yellow yellow red
4. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
5. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow

Comparing these to the inputs, we can notice the following patterns:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears after ""zup"", the output is a sequence of ""yellow.""
- When ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" or at the end of the sequence, it results in red repeated (the number of reds seems to increase by one over the number of reds that just ""wif"" would produce).

Using this information, we can tentatively suggest a rule for ""walm"":

Rule: The word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color output that directly follows ""zup"" (which seems to map to ""yellow""). If ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" or appears at the end of the word sequence, it produces a series of reds, with the count being one plus the number of reds produced by ""wif"" alone.

Therefore:

walm -> When following ""zup"", outputs repeated ""yellow"". When followed by ""wif"" or at the end, outputs repeated ""red"" (with one additional red over what ""wif"" would produce alone).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,83
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Every time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in every example given.
To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we should look for patterns based on the position of the word and the corresponding colors in the output.

Let's analyze the given examples:

1. When ""dax walm wif"" is the input, the output is ""green green green red."" Since ""dax walm"" yields ""green green,"" the additional ""wif"" correlates with ""red.""

2. For the input ""dax wif"", the output is ""green red."" Here, ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" and the presence of ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red.""

3. With ""lug walm zup wif,"" the output is ""blue blue blue yellow red."" In this case, ""lug walm zup"" correlates with ""blue blue blue yellow,"" and again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

4. When ""wif walm"" is input, the output is ""red red red."" It seems that ""wif"" triggers ""red,"" and ""walm"" somehow also corresponds to ""red.""

5. For the input ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif,"" the output is ""red red green green red red red blue red."" In this complicated string, we can again see individual correlations with colors: ""wif"" matches with ""red,"" ""dax"" matches with ""green,"" etc.

Based on these observations, it seems consistent that the occurrence of the word ""wif"" always corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""wif"" within the input string.

So, our rule is:

wif -> red
From the given examples, we can try to deduce the rule governing the appearance of the word ""zup"" by comparing the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Input 1: zup walm -> Output 1: yellow yellow yellow
Input 2: wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> Output 2: red red yellow red blue green
Input 3: zup wif -> Output 3: yellow red
Input 4: dax walm zup -> Output 4: green green green yellow
Input 5: dax walm zup lug -> Output 5: green green green yellow blue

Considering these examples, it appears that every time the word ""zup"" is used, the output is ""yellow"". Moreover, we can observe that other words correspond to different colors: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" As for ""walm,"" given it has only appeared before ""zup"" and the color ""yellow"" follows, we cannot definitively assign it a color.

Thus, the rule for the word ""zup"" seems fairly straightforward:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine each example and look for patterns:

1. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
2. dax zup lug zup bluf -> green yellow blue yellow yellow
3. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
4. dax lug bluf wif -> green blue blue red
5. dax wif dax zup bluf -> green red green yellow yellow

Each time ""bluf"" appears, the word ""yellow"" follows in the output. It doesn't seem to matter what other words precede ""bluf."" Therefore, we can deduce that ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> yellow
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previously mentioned color word three times. If no color word has been mentioned before, no output is generated for 'walm'. 

Examples:

- ""dax lug wif walm"" translates to ""green blue red red red"" because 'wif' corresponds to 'red', and 'walm' causes 'red' to be repeated three more times.
- ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red"" for the same reason—'wif' is 'red', so 'walm' causes a repetition of 'red' three times.
- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"" because 'lug' is 'blue', and 'walm' repeats 'blue' three times.
- ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green"". 'Zup' corresponds to 'yellow', so 'walm' repeats 'yellow' three times. The pattern continues as the colors change.
- ""zup walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red"". 'Zup' is 'yellow' causing 'walm' to repeat 'yellow' three times, then the pattern continues with the new colors.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in English.
From the given examples, we can observe the correlation between the appearance of the word ""dax"" and the output colors:

1. When ""dax"" is present, the output always includes green.
2. The number of times ""green"" appears corresponds to the number of words after ""dax."" In cases where ""dax"" is the last or the only word, ""green"" appears once.

Let's break it down per example:
- In the first example, ""dax zup bluf"" leads to ""green yellow yellow,"" hence ""dax"" corresponds to green and there are two additional words after.
- In the second example, ""dax"" on its own results in a single ""green.""
- The third example has two words after ""dax,"" and we see two green colors following the green for ""dax.""
- The fourth example has one word after ""dax,"" resulting in two green colors after the initial green for ""dax.""
- The fifth one leads to ""blue green,"" indicating that ""lug"" may correspond to ""blue"" and ""dax"" still corresponds to green.

Based on the above observations, the rule for ""dax"" seems to be:

Rule: When ""dax"" appears, the output is green for ""dax"" itself plus as many additional green colors as there are words following ""dax"" in the sequence. If ""dax"" is the last or the only word, the output will be a single green.
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule for the word ""wif."" To achieve this, let's look for patterns that associate ""wif"" with particular outputs in each case:

1. lug wif dax bluf wif lug -> blue red green green red blue. Here, ""wif"" is between ""lug"" and ""dax,"" and the output is ""red green,"" as well as between ""bluf"" and ""lug,"" with the output being ""red blue.""

2. lug dax zup lug wif -> blue green yellow blue red. Here, ""wif"" is at the end after ""lug,"" and the output is ""red.""

3. lug wif bluf -> blue red red. Here, ""wif"" is between ""lug"" and ""bluf,"" and the output is ""red red.""

4. dax bluf wif zup wif -> green green red yellow red. Here, ""wif"" is between ""bluf"" and ""zup,"" with an output of ""red yellow,"" and at the end, producing another ""red.""

5. wif lug -> red blue. Here, ""wif"" is at the beginning, before ""lug,"" and the output is ""red blue.""

It appears that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input string. It doesn't show dependency on adjacent words since it consistently translates to ""red"" despite the words that come before or after it.

Rule: wif -> red.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Explanation: Analyzing the provided examples, we can see that whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" is included in the output at the corresponding position.

Input: lug zup -> Output: blue yellow  
Input: zup lug dax -> Output: yellow blue green  
Input: zup wif walm lug -> Output: yellow red red red blue  
Input: wif zup -> Output: red yellow  
Input: dax zup bluf -> Output: green yellow yellow

The consistent presence of the word ""yellow"" where ""zup"" appears across all different contexts suggests that ""zup"" translates directly to ""yellow."" Hence the rule is established as zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look at the consistent patterns between the input and output across all examples. Let's break it down:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf lug"" results in ""red red blue."" We cannot directly deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" because the word ""wif"" could correspond to the first ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

- In the second example, ""lug walm wif bluf"" results in ""blue blue blue red red."" Here, we know from the previous example that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" yet in the middle, there's another ""blue,"" which suggests ""walm"" might also mean ""blue"" or it may depend on a rule since ""wif"" translates to ""red"" in the last example and does so here as well. At the end, we have ""red red,"" which might indicate that ""bluf"" means ""red,"" but this contradicts the previous instance where ""bluf"" resulted in ""blue."" This suggests that ""bluf"" could be context-dependent.

- In the third example, ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" results in ""yellow yellow red blue green."" Here, we can see ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" The word ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" here, which, based on the second example, could indicate that ""bluf"" means ""red"" when following ""zup.""

- In the fourth example, ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" results in ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow."" In this case, ""lug"" remains consistent as ""blue"" and ""zup"" as ""yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" results in ""yellow,"" which seems to contradict the previous conclusions.

- In the fifth example, ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" results in ""green yellow blue yellow yellow."" We can see that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"" again. It seems to take the color of ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""

Based on the above analysis, there is no single color consistently associated with ""bluf"" in every context. It appears to take on the color of the word preceding it, except when it follows ""lug,"" after which it produces the color ""blue,"" suggesting ""bluf"" could mean ""same as previous,"" except in the specific case following ""lug.""

Rule: bluf -> If the word before bluf is ""lug,"" then bluf translates to ""blue."" Otherwise, it takes the same color as the word before it.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's analyze each example and look for patterns.

Example 1:
- Input: wif walm dax zup
- Output: red red red green yellow

Example 2:
- Input: lug walm wif
- Output: blue blue blue red

Example 3:
- Input: dax zup walm wif walm
- Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red

Example 4:
- Input: dax lug wif walm
- Output: green blue red red red

Example 5:
- Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
- Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

From these examples, we observe the following patterns:

1. When ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" the output is a sequence of reds with the number of reds equal to the number of times ""walm"" appears after the ""wif.""
2. Whenever ""walm"" is present in the input, the color immediately preceding it in the output is repeated as many times as ""walm"" appears directly after the word that has that color output.

To visualize this pattern:
- In example 1, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which outputs red, so ""walm"" also outputs red.
- In example 2, ""lug"" outputs blue, and ""walm"" follows, so it repeats the color blue and then changes to red for ""wif.""

Comparing these observations, we deduce the following rule:

Rule: The presence of ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat the color assigned to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" If it follows ""wif,"" then the output for ""walm"" is always red.

Therefore:
walm -> meaning: A repeater word that causes the repeat of the previous color in the output; if following ""wif,"" results in the color red.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif zup dax
    ",Output: green red yellow green green green,green red yellow green,False,85
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, here is my deduction:

1. ""lug walm wif lug"" -> ""blue blue blue red blue"". Here, lug corresponds to blue at the beginning and the end.
2. ""lug"" -> ""blue"". Again, lug corresponds to blue when it's the only word.
3. ""lug dax walm"" -> ""blue green green green"". Here, lug is blue at the beginning, while the other words following it are green.
4. ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" -> ""green blue blue blue green red red green"". In this sequence, when lug is between dax, it corresponds to blue.
5. ""lug wif"" -> ""blue red"". Lug is blue, and wif is red.

Based on the examples, it seems that the constant within every sequence is that the word lug corresponds to the color blue, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it.

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently correlates with the output ""green."" No matter the context or position in the sequence, ""dax"" always results in ""green."" The surrounding words—""zup,"" ""bluf,"" ""lug,"" ""wif""—correspond to different colors (yellow, green, blue, and red respectively) but the word ""dax"" remains constant in its association.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> meaning. Red

Rule:
- Every instance of the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Therefore, irrespective of position or surrounding words, ""wif"" is translated as ""red.""
Based on the examples provided:

- ""zup"" always corresponds to the output ""yellow.""
- It seems that each word consistently corresponds to a specific color when there's mention of ""dax,"" ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" ""lug,"" or ""walm.""
- ""dax"" correlates to ""green"" when it follows ""zup,"" but to ""blue"" in the third example when it does not follow ""zup."" This difference suggests there could be a positional or contextual rule at play, but there's not enough consistent evidence to conclude the exact rule. Given the example where ""dax"" is immediately after ""zup"" with no other context (""Input: zup dax""), the output is ""yellow green,"" which suggests that ""dax"" translates to ""green"" when immediately following ""zup.""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
- ""bluf"" translates either to ""green"" when following ""dax,"" or to ""blue"" in other positions.
- There's not enough information to ascertain the meaning of ""lug"" and ""walm"" from the examples given, but ""lug"" has been output as ""blue"" three times.

The most consistent rule we can determine solely from this data is:

Rule: ""zup"" consistently means ""yellow.""
From the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" is not a static word with a fixed translation, but rather, it's meaning shifts depending on its position relative to other words. To determine the rule, let's observe the relationship between the inputs and the outputs:

1. In examples where ""bluf"" immediately follows ""lug"" or ""wif,"" the output is consistently ""green.""
   - ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue green""
   - ""wif bluf"" -> ""red green""

2. However, when ""bluf"" precedes ""wif,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""red.""
   - ""bluf wif"" -> ""red red""

3. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is also ""green.""
   - ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
   
4. Additionally, ""bluf"" alone between ""wif"" and ""dax"" still leads to ""green.""
   - ""wif bluf dax"" -> ""red green green""

Considering these observations, one possible rule could be:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" is ""green,"" however, when it immediately precedes ""wif,"" it changes to ""red."" 

Let's apply this rule to check if it holds for all provided examples:

- Input: lug bluf wif
  Expected Output: blue green red
  Actual Output: blue blue red 
  The rule is incorrect; ""bluf"" does not mean ""green"" here; it's ""blue"".

- Input: dax bluf wif zup dax
  Expected Output: green green red yellow green
  Actual Output: green green red yellow green
  Here the rule appears to be correct.

- Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
  Expected Output: yellow blue red green green red
  Actual Output: yellow blue red green green red
  Here the rule seems to be correct as well.

- Input: wif bluf dax
  Expected Output: red green green
  Actual Output: red red green
  The rule fails here; ""bluf"" is ""red"", not ""green"".

- Input: wif dax bluf
  Expected Output: red green green
  Actual Output: red green green
  Here the rule holds.

The initial rule was close but not fully accurate. It seems ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes it, unless it is the first word and it is before ""wif,"" then it is ""red."" Let's refine the rule based on this new observation:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately preceding it; if ""bluf"" is the first word before ""wif,"" it is ""red.""

Let's apply this refined rule:

- Input: lug bluf wif
  Rule Application: ""bluf"" takes the color ""blue"" from ""lug"".
  Output: blue blue red
  The refined rule holds.

- Input: dax bluf wif zup dax
  Rule Application: ""bluf"" takes the color ""green"" from ""dax"".
  Output: green green red yellow green
  The refined rule holds.

- Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
  Rule Application: ""bluf"" takes the color ""green"" from ""dax"".
  Output: yellow blue red green green red
  The refined rule holds.

- Input: wif bluf dax
  Rule Application: ""bluf"" takes the color ""red"" from ""wif"".
  Output: red red green
  The refined rule holds.

- Input: wif dax bluf
  Rule Application: ""bluf"" takes the color ""green"" from ""dax"".
  Output: red green green
  The refined rule holds.

The refined rule matches all the examples. Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the meaning (color) of the word that immediately precedes it. If ""bluf"" appears at the beginning before ""wif,"" then it means ""red.""
To deduce the meaning or pattern associated with the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine how the number of its occurrences and its position within the input string seems to correlate with the color outputs given.

From the examples given:

1. ""zup walm dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green""
    - Here, ""walm"" is followed by a single ""green.""

2. ""wif lug dax walm"" -> ""red blue green green green""
    - Here, ""walm"" is at the end and followed by two ""green.""

3. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" -> ""green blue blue blue yellow red""
    - Here, ""walm"" is in the middle and followed by two ""blue"" and then a ""yellow red.""

4. ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red blue blue""
    - Here, ""walm"" is followed by three ""blue,"" one ""red,"" and then one ""blue.""

5. ""zup lug walm wif walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""
    - Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""blue,"" then ""red,"" and then ""walm"" again leads to ""red red red.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following:
- When ""walm"" appears, it is followed by a chain of colors.
- The color pattern that follows ""walm"" seems to be dependent on the words following it. When it's followed by different words, we get ""blue"" and when it's at the end, we get ""green.""
- When ""walm"" follows itself, the color ""red"" is produced, and its amount increases by one more than the previous amount of ""red"" produced after the previous ""walm.""

From these patterns, it's not entirely clear what specific meaning ""walm"" conveys, but a tentative rule could be as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" initiates a sequence of colors based on the words that follow ""walm."" When ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, it produces a ""green"" color output, with additional 'green' for each occurrence at the end. When ""walm"" is followed by a word other than ""walm,"" it produces a ""blue"" color output, and when ""walm"" precedes itself, it triggers a sequence of ""red,"" with the number of ""red"" outputs incrementing by one with each successive ""walm.""

Let's apply the tentative rule:

""Walm"" followed by ""dax"" -> one ""green""
""Walm"" followed by any word that is not ""walm"" or ""dax"" -> ""blue""
Consecutive ""walm"" -> starting with one ""red"" for the first ""walm,"" incrementing by one for each subsequent ""walm""

Since we cannot observe a consistent alignment across all examples due to a lack of a complete dataset of nonces and their outputs, the rule derived here is speculative and would require a confirmation from additional data to validate or adjust the proposed rule.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,86
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" consistently. Each time ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, the output includes the word ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we need to look at the relationship between the inputs and outputs within each example. Let's examine each one and note any patterns:

1. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   - ""wif"" precedes ""zup"" and is output as red, while ""zup"" is output as yellow.
    
2. Input: lug wif zup wif walm
   Output: blue red yellow red red red
   - The first ""wif"" is again before a ""zup"" and outputs red, as before.

3. Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
   Output: green green red yellow red
   - The pattern of ""wif zup"" resulting in red yellow continues. The second ""wif"" is not followed by ""zup"" but still results in red.

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - ""wif"" follows ""zup"" resulting in red again.

5. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue
   - ""wif"" is followed by a new word ""lug"" which outputs as blue, but ""wif"" still results in red.

By examining these examples, we can safely conclude that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red, regardless of its position or the words surrounding it.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following relationships:

- ""zup"" always corresponds to the output ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" always corresponds to the output ""blue"".
- ""wif"" seems to correspond to the output ""red"".

Since ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red"", this suggests that ""walm"" might be an intensifier that triples the output associated with the word before it. However, since ""walm"" does not appear alone or in other contexts, we cannot be certain that it always serves this function, so for our purposes, we can only confirm the behavior of ""walm"" in this specific instance.

Accordingly, the rule for ""zup"" is consistent across all examples:

Rule: **zup -> yellow**
Rule: bluf means to repeat the previous color. 

Examples:
- In ""dax lug bluf dax"", dax is green, then lug is blue, and bluf repeats blue before ending with dax which is green again.
- In ""lug bluf zup lug"", lug is blue, bluf repeats blue, then zup is yellow, followed by lug which is blue.
- In ""lug bluf"", lug is blue and bluf repeats the blue.
- In ""zup bluf wif bluf"", zup is yellow, bluf repeats yellow, wif is red, and bluf repeats the red.
- In ""zup bluf wif walm"", the pattern is yellow (zup), then yellow again (bluf), red (wif), and red repeated two times because walm seems to mean repeat the previous color two times (given that it yields two additional reds).

So, bluf -> repeat the previous color.
Observing the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the rule governing the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" based on the relationship between the input and output.

Here are the interpretations of each input/output pair:
1. Input: ""zup walm"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
2. Input: ""lug walm zup"" -> Output: ""blue blue blue yellow""
3. Input: ""dax wif walm"" -> Output: ""green red red red""
4. Input: ""zup walm"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
5. Input: ""wif walm dax zup"" -> Output: ""red red red green yellow""

The word immediately preceding ""walm"" seems to determine the series of colors given in the output. The sequence of colors consists of three occurrences of the color corresponding to the word right before ""walm,"" with an additional color sometimes added depending on other words that follow ""walm.""

For example:
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is a series of three yellows.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output series starts with three blues.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" we see three greens, but when ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" we see three reds.

It's also observed that additional words following ""walm"" are translated into additional colors, maintaining their order and corresponding color in the output.

Based on this pattern, we can infer that ""walm"" means a sequence of three colors corresponding to the word immediately before it. If there are words after ""walm,"" they also cause their corresponding color to be appended to the end of the sequence.

Rule: ""walm"" -> repeat the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" three times. If there are any words after ""walm,"" append the corresponding color for each to the end of the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,87
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning: blue

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each given example.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"". Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red

Rule: When you see the word ""wif"", it means the color red.
Based on the examples provided, we can observe that every time the nonce word ""zup"" is used, the output is consistent regardless of its position in the input sentence:

- ""dax lug zup"" -> ""green blue yellow""
- ""lug wif zup wif walm"" -> ""blue red yellow red red red""
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- ""zup walm lug"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue""
- ""wif zup bluf"" -> ""red yellow yellow""

From the above, it's clear that each time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> ""red"" when following ""wif"", ""blue"" when following ""lug"" or ""zup"".
From analyzing the given examples, a pattern emerges concerning the output each time the nonce word ""walm"" is used.

1. When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"", the output is ""green green green"".
2. When ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" and ""bluf"", the output is ""green green green red red"".
3. When ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"", the output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue"".
4. When ""wif"" and ""bluf"" precede ""dax bluf wif"" followed by ""walm"" and then ""lug wif"", the output is ""red red green green red red red blue red"".
5. When ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" followed by ""wif lug"", the output is ""blue blue blue red blue"".

From these examples, the rule seems to associate ""walm"" with the repetition of the color corresponding to the previous word, three times. We can induce the following:

- ""dax"" correlates to ""green""
- ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" correlates to ""blue""

The color repeats as many times as ""walm"" occurs. Following ""walm"", another word may dictate an additional color. For instance, ""wif"" following ""walm"" results in an additional ""red"", though this is also dependent on the context because ""wif"" in other instances also translates to ""red"".

Another pattern to note is the absence of ""walm"", ""wif"" correlates with ""red"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word preceding it.

Given these observations, the meaning of ""walm"" in the context of the examples given is:

walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times. 

Rule: ""walm"" takes the color of the word before it and repeats it thrice in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf
    ",Output: yellow yellow,yellow yellow,True,88
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word 'lug' corresponds to the color 'blue'.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we must look for patterns in the inputs and corresponding outputs:

- When ""dax"" appears alongside ""lug"" (in examples 1 and 5), the output starts with ""green blue.""
- When ""dax"" appears before ""walm"" (in example 3), the output is ""green green green.""
- When ""dax"" appears between ""zup"" and ""bluf"" (in example 2), the output is ""yellow green green.""
- When ""dax"" appears before ""lug zup"" (in example 4), the output is ""green blue yellow.""

Based on these examples, it seems that whenever ""dax"" appears, the word ""green"" immediately follows in the output. This can be confirmed by every instance where ""dax"" is present, and ""green"" follows in the output.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

dax -> green

Rule: The presence of ""dax"" in the input results in ""green"" in the corresponding position in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze each of the examples, paying attention to the patterns of inputs and corresponding outputs.

1. ""zup wif bluf zup"" -> ""yellow red red yellow""
2. ""dax wif"" -> ""green red""
3. ""zup wif walm lug"" -> ""yellow red red red blue""
4. ""lug walm wif"" -> ""blue blue blue red""
5. ""wif lug bluf"" -> ""red blue blue""

From the examples, we can observe that:

- In examples 1, 3, and 4, ""wif"" comes after a color word (e.g., ""zup,"" ""lug"") and is followed by a sequence with one or more words.
- In example 2, ""wif"" follows a color word (""dax"") and is the last word in the sequence.
- In example 5, ""wif"" is the first word, followed by a sequence of color words (""lug bluf"").

Regardless of its position, ""wif"" is always followed by ""red"" in the output. It seems that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" while other words correspond to their respective colors:

- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" -> ""blue""
- ""dax"" -> ""green""
- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- ""walm"" -> ""red""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the term ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, the color ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output.

Here is the pattern seen in the examples:

1. Input: zup bluf dax -> Output: yellow yellow green
2. Input: zup dax lug -> Output: yellow green blue
3. Input: lug zup -> Output: blue yellow
4. Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
5. Input: lug zup -> Output: blue yellow

In each case, the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence determines where ""yellow"" appears in the output sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the provided input and output examples, we can establish the following correlations:

- When ""wif"" is present, the output is ""red.""
- When ""lug"" is present, the output is ""blue.""
- When ""zup"" is present, the output is ""yellow.""

Now, we can examine the occurrences of ""bluf"" in various contexts:

1. ""wif bluf lug"" results in ""red red blue."" Since ""wif"" correlates with ""red"" and ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and there are two occurrences of ""red"" before ""blue,"" ""bluf"" in this context results in an additional ""red.""

2. ""wif bluf zup bluf wif"" results in ""red red yellow yellow red."" This suggests that ""bluf"" after ""wif"" might again lead to ""red."" But ""bluf"" after ""zup"" leads to ""yellow."" In this example, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color of the word that precedes it.

3. ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red."" This once again supports the idea that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it, which is ""red"" in this case.

4. ""wif zup bluf"" results in ""red yellow yellow."" Consistently, ""bluf"" is repeating the color of the word before it, which is ""yellow"" here.

5. ""lug bluf wif"" results in ""blue blue red."" This is consistent with the pattern, as ""bluf"" repeats the color ""blue,"" which is associated with ""lug.""

Based on these observations, we can conclude the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" -> outputs the color associated with the immediately preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns of input and output:

1. Whenever ""walm"" occurs in the input, the output consists of repeated words, each occurrence of ""walm"" corresponds to three repetitions:
   - ""walm lug"" -> ""red red red blue""
   - ""walm"" -> ""red red red""
   - ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
   - ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green green green red""

2. The word immediately before ""walm"" determines the color that is repeated:
   - If ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" it is followed by ""blue blue blue"".
   - If ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" it is followed by ""green green green"".

3. The presence of ""wif"" after ""walm"" does not alter the pattern of repetition but does affect the color that follows:
   - ""walm wif"" results in ""red red red red,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

From these observations, it appears that ""walm"" prompts the repetition of a color word, with the specific color determined by the word immediately preceding ""walm."" But the words ""zup"" and ""wif"" do not clearly correspond to a color each time they appear. 

Based on the information provided, it seems that ""walm"" induces a repetition rule with some dependency on the preceding word. The rule, however, can't be fully determined for all cases due to the ambiguous role of ""zup"" and ""wif"" in the examples given. 

For the cases where the rule is clear, we can infer:
Rule: The word ""walm"" results in the thrice-repeated output of the color that corresponds to the word before ""walm"" in the input.

However, the rule might include more complexity not illustrated by the given examples, particularly regarding how other words in the input sequence affect the output when preceding ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" seems to correlate with the color ""blue"" in the given examples. Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
Rule: dax -> green

The given examples consistently show that whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""green."" There's no context indicating that the meaning of ""dax"" changes based on position or surrounding words. Therefore, the rule is that ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the word ""red"" in each output. This can be determined as follows:

- In ""Input: wif"" we have ""Output: red,"" which directly suggests that ""wif"" means ""red.""
- In every other example where ""wif"" appears, the word ""red"" follows in the same position in the output sequence. 

Here is the explicit mapping from each example:

1. ""wif dax zup wif"" -> ""red green yellow red""
   Here, ""wif"" at both the beginning and the end translates to ""red.""

2. ""wif"" -> ""red""
   This is a direct mapping with no other words to add context.

3. ""dax wif"" -> ""green red""
   ""dax"" must mean ""green,"" and ""wif"" is ""red.""

4. ""dax lug dax lug wif"" -> ""green blue green blue red""
   ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" and ""lug"" by ""blue"" again, with ""wif"" being the last word and mapping to ""red.""

5. ""wif lug dax"" -> ""red blue green""
   ""wif"" comes first and corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"". Therefore, the rule I can deduce is:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" means the color ""yellow"".
Rule: bluf -> same color as the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in which it appears and the corresponding outputs:

1. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" 
 - The word ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow."" 

2. ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif"" results in ""blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red.""
 - ""lug"" correlates to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to a single ""yellow."" When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it leads to a repetition of ""blue,"" and when following ""zup,"" it leads to a repetition of ""yellow.""

3. ""wif dax lug walm"" results in ""red green blue blue blue.""
 - Here, ""wif"" correlates to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it results in additional ""blue.""

4. ""lug walm zup walm"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow.""
 - Again, ""lug"" correlates to ""blue"" and ""zup"" to a single ""yellow."" Upon appearance, ""walm"" extends the color from the word before it.

5. ""lug dax walm"" results in ""blue green green green.""
 - ""lug"" correlates to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" In this case, ""walm"" following ""dax"" results in additional ""green.""

From these examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color word that directly precedes it. It repeats the color three times for the output.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm
    ",Output: green green green,green green green,True,90
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, we can induce a rule about the meaning of the word ""dax."" Each usage of ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Here’s the rule after examining each pair of input and output:

- ""dax zup dax"" corresponds to ""green yellow green"". ""Dax"" correlates with ""green"" at both positions in the output.
- ""wif dax"" corresponds to ""red green"". ""Dax"" is at the end and correlates with ""green.""
- ""dax lug walm"" corresponds to ""green blue blue blue"". ""Dax"" is at the beginning and correlates with ""green.""
- ""dax"" by itself corresponds to ""green"". ""Dax"" alone yields a single color output of ""green.""
- ""zup dax"" corresponds to ""yellow green"". ""Dax"" again correlates with ""green.""

Rule: dax -> ""green""
Based on the provided examples, it looks like the nonce word ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red."" In every instance where ""wif"" is mentioned, the term ""red"" shows up in the output. The position of ""wif"" in the input doesn't affect the color associated with it. Here is the mapping from the examples:

1. ""wif walm dax"" corresponds to ""red red red green."" Here, ""wif"" is the first word and it maps to the first ""red"" output.
2. ""wif bluf dax walm"" corresponds to ""red red green green green."" Similarly, ""wif"" is the first word and it maps to the first ""red"" output.
3. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" corresponds to ""green blue blue blue yellow red."" The ""wif"" at the end corresponds to the last ""red"" in the output.
4. ""lug wif dax"" corresponds to ""blue red green."" Here ""wif"" being the second word corresponds to the second color ""red"" in the output.
5. ""wif"" on its own gives an output of ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow. 

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
From the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" directly translates to a repeated color that precedes it. Here's how we can deduce this:

1. In the first example, ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green,"" which shows that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""dax"" translates to ""green"". Since ""bluf"" is followed by a repeated ""red,"" it suggests that ""bluf"" indicates a repetition of the previous color.

2. ""zup bluf lug dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue green blue"". Here, ""zup"" appears to translate to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue,"" while ""dax"" remains consistent as ""green"". ""bluf"" precedes another ""yellow,"" pointing again to the rule that ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the previous color.

3. In ""wif bluf,"" we see ""red red"" as the output once again, reinforcing the idea that ""bluf"" is causing the term ""wif"" which is ""red"" to repeat.

4. ""zup bluf wif dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow red green blue"". Here, ""zup"" is consistently ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" is followed by a repeated ""yellow"".

5. Finally, ""zup bluf dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow green blue"". Again, ""bluf"" results in a repeat of ""yellow,"" and the other words maintain their respective color translations.

Hence, based on these observations, the rule is:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: When the word ""bluf"" appears, it indicates that the color word before ""bluf"" should be repeated in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here's how it can be deduced:

1. ""wif walm"" produces ""red red red."" The word ""wif"" corresponds to a single ""red,"" and when ""walm"" follows, it seems to repeat the color ""red"" two more times.
2. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue."" Similarly, ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats it twice more.
3. For ""zup wif lug zup walm,"" the pattern is ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" When ""walm"" follows the second ""zup,"" the color ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
4. In ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug,"" the output is ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue,"" which suggests that ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" might correspond to another color not shown through ""walm,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" twice more, ""dax"" is ""green,"" and then ""lug"" again is ""blue.""
5. ""zup walm lug"" generates ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" ""Zup"" relates to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" once again causes a tripling of the preceding color – ""yellow"" in this case. Then ""lug"" changes the sequence to ""blue.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow blue,yellow yellow blue,True,91
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the outputs. Each instance of ""lug"" in the input results in ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the position or the presence of other words.
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we should look at the examples given and try to identify a pattern. We should compare the input containing ""dax"" and the corresponding output to find a consistent rule.

Here are the inputs and outputs with ""dax"":

1. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green
2. lug dax zup wif -> blue green yellow red
3. wif bluf dax -> red red green
4. dax zup -> green yellow
5. dax bluf wif lug -> green green red blue

Now, let's examine where ""dax"" appears:

1. In the third position following ""lug walm,"" the output is green.
2. In the second position following ""lug,"" the output is green.
3. In the third position following ""wif bluf,"" the output is green.
4. In the first position followed by ""zup,"" the output is green.
5. In the first position followed by ""bluf wif lug,"" the output is green.

In every instance, regardless of its position or the words around it, ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green."" There doesn't appear to be a dependency on the surrounding words; ""dax"" consistently maps to the color green.

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" I will compare its context within different input strings and look at the corresponding color in the output strings. From the given examples, let's try to understand the pattern:

- Example 1: wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
- Example 2: zup wif -> yellow red
- Example 3: zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
- Example 4: dax lug dax wif dax -> green blue green red green
- Example 5: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

Now let's analyze the appearances of ""wif"" in the context of these examples:

1. When ""wif"" appears, regardless of position, it always translates to red in the output.
2. Its appearance does not change the output color for the words around it; other words correspond consistently to their own colors in the output (e.g., ""dax"" always corresponds to green, ""zup"" always corresponds to yellow).

Based on these observations, it appears that the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red in the output. The position of ""wif"" within the input does not seem to matter for its representation in the output.

The rule seems to be:

wif -> red

Rule: ""wif"" consistently translates to the color red in the output, regardless of its position in the input string.
Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following correspondence between the input words and output colors:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- walm -> yellow 
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow

Now, let's test our hypothesis against the examples:

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
Analysis: All color assignments match the output, including the position of 'zup' corresponding to the first 'yellow' after 'blue'.

Input: lug zup dax wif
Output: blue yellow green red
Analysis: Again, 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', fitting the pattern.

Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
Analysis: 'zup' matches 'yellow' in both instances.

Input: dax zup dax zup
Output: green yellow green yellow
Analysis: Consistent with 'zup' being 'yellow'.

Input: zup dax wif
Output: yellow green red
Analysis: Fits the rule with 'zup' indicating 'yellow'.

Considering the evidence from all the examples, the rule we can induce is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided where ""bluf"" always translates to ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence, we can infer the rule for ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the following word to have its corresponding output repeated three times. Let's look at the examples:

- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green."" Without ""walm,"" we might infer that ""dax"" would lead to a single ""green.""
- ""wif walm dax zup"" gives ""red red red green yellow."" We see that ""wif"" alone could potentially correspond to ""red,"" but ""walm"" following ""wif"" makes ""red"" repeat three times. The pattern of ""walm"" after ""dax"" is consistent with the first example.
- ""dax walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue blue blue."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" again, resulting in ""green"" repeated three times, and later, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which results in ""blue"" repeated three times.
- ""zup walm"" in both the fourth and fifth examples leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which indicates that ""walm"" following ""zup"" makes ""yellow"" repeat three times.

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the following word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the next color to be outputted three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug walm dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule:

Based on the provided examples, each nonce word appears to correspond to a specific color:

- Every instance of ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- Every instance of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- Every instance of ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" following the word ""wif"" and ""yellow"" otherwise.
- Every instance of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- Every instance of ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

There is a consistency with the word ""lug"" always translating to the color ""blue"" regardless of position or surrounding words. Therefore, based on the examples provided:

lug -> blue.
Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the word ""dax."" We will look for patterns in the inputs and outputs to understand what ""dax"" corresponds to.

Looking at the examples:
1. ""zup walm dax lug"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow green blue."" Since ""dax"" is followed by ""lug"" and the corresponding output is ""green,"" we can deduce that ""dax"" might mean ""green"" when before ""lug."" However, we need more examples to confirm this.

2. ""wif dax"" gives ""red green."" Since there are no other words to compare ""dax"" to, this might suggest that in isolation ""dax"" could mean ""green.""

3. ""lug dax lug wif"" gives ""blue green blue red."" This also supports the hypothesis that ""dax"" means ""green,"" as it is again placed between ""lug"" (blue) and followed by another ""lug"" (blue), with ""dax"" corresponding to ""green"" in the output.

4. The repetition of the example ""wif dax"" giving ""red green"" continues to support that ""dax"" might mean ""green.""

5. ""zup lug zup dax"" gives ""yellow blue yellow green."" Here, ""dax"" comes after ""zup"" (yellow), which previously had no influence over the color it represented. This reinforces the notion that ""dax"" does not depend on the preceding word for its meaning.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"" regardless of its position or surrounding words. Therefore, we can deduce the rule:

dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each nonce word is associated with a particular color as follows:

- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- walm -> yellow

The word “wif” consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Each example that contains ""wif"" results in the output including the color red.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" It does not seem to change meaning based on position in the sentence or the surrounding words. Each occurrence of ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow
From the given examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the color ""red"" when it appears after the word ""wif,"" which itself translates to ""red."" However, in other contexts, ""bluf"" does not translate to ""red."" This indicates that ""bluf"" might not have a fixed meaning but rather a context-dependent one.

Let's analyze the occurrences:

- In examples 1, 2, and 3 where ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is always ""red.""
- In examples 1, 3, and 4 when ""lug"" is placed before ""bluf,"" the corresponding output color for ""bluf"" is ""blue.""
- In example 5, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" and the corresponding output is ""yellow.""

By considering these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" might take on the color of the word that precedes it. To confirm:

- ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and when ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and when ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow.""
- However, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" but when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is also ""red,"" meaning in this specific instance, the rule of taking the preceding word's color doesn't apply.

Given these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" could be:

Rule: bluf translates to the color of the preceding word, except when it follows ""wif,"" where it always translates to ""red.""
walm -> rule. Rule: Repeat the color associated with the previous word twice more.

In each example, the word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated two additional times. Here's the breakdown:

Example 1: ""wif bluf dax walm""
- wif -> red
- bluf -> red
- dax -> green
- walm -> repeat the color of dax, which is green, two more times

Output: red red green green green

Example 2: ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm""
- wif -> red
- walm -> repeat the color of wif, which is red, two more times
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- walm -> repeat the color of lug, which is blue, two more times

Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

Example 3: ""zup bluf wif walm""
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow
- wif -> red
- walm -> repeat the color of wif, which is red, two more times

Output: yellow yellow red red red

Example 4: ""lug walm""
- lug -> blue
- walm -> repeat the color of lug, which is blue, two more times

Output: blue blue blue

Example 5: ""lug walm wif zup wif""
- lug -> blue
- walm -> repeat the color of lug, which is blue, two more times
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red

Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"" in the outputs provided.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples provided, whenever the word 'dax' appears in the input, the corresponding output is 'green'. Thus, 'dax' translates to the color 'green' in the outputs.
The examples given show a consistent pattern where the word ""wif"" always corresponds to the color ""red"". Regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it, ""wif"" translates to ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" correlates with the output ""yellow"" in every instance it appears. There is no additional context to suggest that ""zup"" has a meaning that is dependent upon its position within the input or on the other words present. Thus, the most straightforward rule that can be induced from these examples is that ""zup"" directly translates to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, each time the word ""bluf"" is used, the output is a repetition of the color associated with the word that directly precedes it. Here is how the rule applies:

- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"" (The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" causes it to be repeated.)
- ""dax bluf wif zup"" -> ""green green red yellow"" (""bluf"" repeats the green from ""dax,"" and then the sequence continues normally with ""red"" for ""wif"" and ""yellow"" for ""zup."")
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"" (""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the red.)
- ""dax walm wif bluf"" -> ""green green green red red"" (""walm"" seems to correspond to green as well, and ""bluf"" causes the red from ""wif"" to be repeated.)
- ""dax bluf lug wif"" -> ""green green blue red"" (Again, ""bluf"" causes the repeat of green from ""dax,"" then ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""wif"" to red.)

Thus, the rule appears to be:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated in the output.
To discover the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the patterns of its appearances and corresponding outputs:

1. In the presence of ""dax"" preceding ""walm"":
   - Example: ""dax wif walm"" -> ""green red red red""
   - Example: ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
   
   It seems ""walm"" following ""dax"" repeats the color associated with ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

2. In the presence of ""wif"" preceding ""walm"":
   - Example: ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
   - Example: ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" presents a repeating pattern with ""walm"" after ""wif,"" resulting in repeated ""red.""
   
   It appears that ""walm"" following ""wif"" repeats the color associated with ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

3. When ""walm"" appears by itself (with neither ""dax"" nor ""wif"" preceding directly):
   - Example: ""zup wif lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow""
   
   The ""walm"" in this example repeats the color associated with the immediate precedent word, which in this case is ""zup.""

Considering the evidence from the examples, ""walm"" seems to indicate repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word.

Rule: walm -> replicates the color of the word that comes before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" in the input consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, it seems that each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green."" Here are the observations:

- When the input is just ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" appears with other words like ""walm,"" ""wif,"" or ""bluf,"" the other words have their consistent respective outputs, but ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green.""

This consistency implies that ""dax"" corresponds specifically to the color green in the output regardless of its position in the input or the presence of other words.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" directly translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided input-output pairs, it appears that each word translates to a specific color. Here is the translation for each non-bluf word based on the examples given:

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- walm -> blue (based on example 3)

Looking only at the outputs in which bluf appears, we can try to deduce its meaning by checking what is common in those outputs:

- red red
- yellow yellow red green red yellow
- blue blue blue red blue blue
- yellow red red yellow blue
- green blue blue blue green red red green

Considering the pattern in these sequences, it's evident that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"". However, there's an additional ""red"" appearing immediately after ""bluf"". We can deduce that ""bluf"" means not just ""red"", but rather it duplicates the last color mentioned before it.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color word immediately preceding it.
Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the previous word three times. 

Evidence for this rule can be observed from the given inputs and outputs:

- In the first input ""zup walm wif,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm"" we see ""yellow"" repeated three times, followed by ""red"" for ""wif.""
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green"" being repeated three times, where ""dax"" is associated with ""green.""
- In the third input ""wif lug dax walm,"" we see that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" After ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated three times.
- ""wif walm zup"" output is ""red"" repeated three times followed by ""yellow"" for ""zup,"" indicating that ""walm"" caused the repetition of ""red,"" which is associated with ""wif.""
- Lastly, ""dax walm wif zup"" shows ""green"" repeated three times after ""dax,"" followed by the colors associated with ""wif"" and ""zup,"" respectively.

Hence, walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Every time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding output. The position of ""lug"" within the sequence doesn't seem to affect its meaning; it consistently translates to ""blue.""
Rule: dax -> green

The word 'dax' consistently corresponds to the color green in the output, regardless of the position in the sequence or the surrounding words.
Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" is present in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, each nonce word corresponds to a specific color:
- ""zup"" consistently maps to the color ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" consistently maps to the color ""blue"".
- ""wif"" consistently maps to the color ""red"".
- ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green"".
- ""walm"" does not appear alone, but ""walm wif"" together map to ""green red"", and since ""wif"" is ""red"", it might be deduced that ""walm"" is ""green"", though it's not confirmed by a standalone example.

Thus, the rule seems to be that each nonce word represents a specific color when translated to English. The order of colors in the output matches the order of nonce words in the input.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to examine the context in which it is used and the corresponding outputs. Let's analyze the provided inputs and outputs:

1. When ""zup dax bluf"" is input, the output is ""yellow green green"". This suggests that ""bluf"" could mean ""green,"" since both ""zup"" and ""dax"" seem to be producing ""yellow"" and ""green"" respectively, and ""bluf"" is the only new word added to produce an additional ""green.""

2. In the case of ""lug bluf,"" which consistently results in ""blue blue,"" it enforces the idea that ""lug"" means ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" likely means ""blue"" as well since it is repeated in the output.

3. With the final input ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug,"" which yields ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue,"" we can see that ""wif"" correlates to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" Given that ""bluf"" is sandwiched between two ""blue"" outputs, it would still support the rule that ""bluf"" means ""blue.""

Based on these analyses, it seems that ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue,"" regardless of the position in the input string. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> blue.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at each example and see how it translates to the output sequence:

1. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
   - Since ""walm"" is followed by two ""lug"" which translate to ""blue,"" and the output is two ""yellow"" between the blues, ""walm"" could mean repetition of the previously mentioned color.

2. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
   - The sequence ""lug walm"" resulted in ""blue blue blue,"" reinforcing the idea that ""walm"" might mean repeating the previous color.
   - Since ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" the rule for ""walm"" still holds.
   
3. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   - Here again, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and results in two more ""blue"" colors followed by ""dax"" which translates to ""green.""
   
4. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   - ""dax"" (green), ""zup"" (yellow), ""walm"" repeating the yellow, then ""wif"" (red) followed by ""walm"" which causes the red to repeat.
   
5. Input: dax walm wif dax
   Output: green green green red green
   - Following the same pattern, ""walm"" after ""dax"" (green) results in two more ""green"" colors before moving on to the ""wif"" (red) and then back to ""dax"" (green).

Rule:
walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the last word until a new color word appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position or the words that surround it in a sequence.
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rules for the word ""wif"" and its relationship to colors:

1. Every occurrence of ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
2. Other words that follow ""wif"" transform into other colors based on some rule not directly provided but could be hypothesized as:
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green"".
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".
   - ""walm"" when following ""wif"" causes a repetition of the color ""red"" as many times as it appears in the sequence.

Given this, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: The word ""wif"" is consistently translated to the color ""red"". The translation of other words to specific colors after ""wif"" appears to be consistent but those specific rules are not completely provided here.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Given the information provided and analyzing the patterns, we can deduce a possible rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" 

In each instance where ""bluf"" appears, the output is a repeated color word. The repeated color word corresponds to the color that represents the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" The color associations for the words we know are as follows:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Now, applying the rule:

- In ""wif bluf,"" the output is ""red red"" because ""wif"" is associated with ""red.""
- In ""wif zup dax bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which we don't have a color for, but since the output is ""green green,"" it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- In ""zup bluf wif walm,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" and both ""zup"" and ""wif"" have colors associated with them. ""Bluf,"" in this case, seems to repeat the color for ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
- In ""zup bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow,"" supporting that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word, which is ""yellow"" for ""zup.""
- In ""wif bluf zup,"" the output is ""red red yellow,"" with ""bluf"" repeating ""red"" for ""wif,"" then ""zup"" has its own color, ""yellow.""

Given this pattern, the rule we can induce for ""bluf"" is:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to function as a modifier that repeats the color associated with the word right before it three times.

- In the first example, ""lug"" is associated with the color blue, and afterward ""walm"" generates three more blues.
- In the second example, the pattern holds with ""lug"" followed by ""walm"" causing a repetition of blue four times in total (once for ""lug"" and three times for ""walm"").
- In the third example, ""wif"" is associated with red, and ""walm"" results in three additional reds.
- In the last two examples (which are the same), ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and ""walm"" results in two additional yellows.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" based on these examples is:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows another word, the output is the color associated with the preceding word repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

Rule: wif -> red.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze the pattern in which colors appear in relation to ""zup"" and other words:

- In each example where ""zup"" appears, the color ""yellow"" appears.
- ""zup"" appears to be independent of the words that follow it since ""yellow"" immediately follows ""zup"" regardless of the next word.
- Additionally, other words appear to correlate with specific colors:
  - ""lug"" seems to always correspond with the color ""blue.""
  - ""wif"" appears to correspond with the color ""red,"" shown by its repeated output after ""zup wif walm"" and at the beginning of ""zup wif zup dax.""
  - ""walm"" correlates with the color ""yellow,"" as seen in ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" and ""zup wif walm.""
  - ""bluf"" is consistently associated with the color ""red,"" appearing at the end of ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" and within ""zup walm lug wif bluf.""
  - ""dax"" is paired with the color ""green,"" which is indicated in ""zup wif zup dax.""

Given this analysis, we can conclude that:

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position or the surrounding words.

Thus: zup -> yellow
bluf -> the color represented by the preceding word.

Rule: The word 'bluf' takes the meaning of the color word immediately before it. If 'dax' means green, 'dax bluf' translates to 'green green'. If 'zup' means yellow, 'zup bluf' translates to 'yellow yellow'. The same pattern follows with 'wif' meaning red, 'wif bluf' translates to 'red red'.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we first look for patterns in how the word is associated with colors in the different examples. To do this, we analyze the outputs to see how they relate to the presence of ""walm"" and the other words in each input.

The patterns in the example inputs and outputs are as follows:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the color that corresponds to ""lug"" is repeated three times: 
   - Input: ""lug zup dax walm"" -> Output: ""blue yellow green green green""
   - Input: ""lug walm zup"" -> Output: ""blue blue blue yellow""
   - Input: ""lug dax walm wif"" -> Output: ""blue green green green red""

2. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the color corresponding to ""dax,"" which is green, is repeated twice:
   - Input: ""dax walm wif"" -> Output: ""green green green red""
   - Note: There is no example of ""walm"" following ""dax"" in isolation, so the pattern might also be that ""walm"" repeats the preceding color two times.

3. In the input with both ""lug"" and ""dax"" followed by ""walm,"" ""walm"" follows the pattern of repeating the color of the word that comes immediately before it, rather than the first word:
   - Input: ""lug dax walm wif"" -> Output: ""blue green green green red""
   
4. In cases where ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" or ""wif"", it does not repeat the preceding color, rather it follows its own unique color pattern which is ""yellow"" in the case of ""zup"" and ""red"" for ""wif"":
   - Input: ""lug wif dax zup walm"" -> Output: ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow""
   - Here ""walm"" did not repeat ""zup's"" color (yellow) three times, but two times, implying that ""walm"" could mean a modification of the repetition rule depending on the preceding word or the position of ""walm"".

Given these observations, the pattern for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately before it multiple times, but the number of repetitions might be affected by the words present in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the word immediately before it multiple times (three times after ""lug,"" two times after ""dax,"" and potentially varies with other words or positions).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the outputs. Every instance where ""lug"" is present in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output, regardless of its position or the presence of other words.

Therefore, the rule for the word ""lug"" is as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on these examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently leads to the output ""green,"" regardless of the position in the input sequence or the words that surround it. Each of the inputs featuring ""dax"" yields ""green"" in the corresponding position in the output.

Additionally, observing the other words:

- ""wif"" consistently leads to the output ""red"".
- ""walm"" is associated with repeating the color associated with the previous word, hence ""green green green"" after ""dax walm"".
- ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and results in ""green"" following ""dax,"" but ""bluf"" also follows ""wif"" and the output is the same, hence we might infer that ""bluf"" also translates to ""green.""
- ""lug"" yields output ""blue"" consistently whenever it appears.

From this, we can deduct the rule:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, it seems that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, no matter the position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> meaning. 

Rule: The word 'zup' translates to the word 'yellow.' Each subsequent word appears to be a color coded as follows: 'lug' corresponds to 'blue,' 'bluf' corresponds to 'yellow,' 'walm' corresponds to 'yellow yellow' (repetition indicates the number of times the word 'yellow' should be output), 'dax' corresponds to 'green,' and 'wif' corresponds to 'red.' Therefore, when 'zup' is present in an input, it is always followed by the color 'yellow' in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that is mentioned before ""bluf"". When ""bluf"" appears for the first time, it takes the color that precedes it. When ""bluf"" occurs again in the same sequence, it keeps the color previously assigned to it, irrespective of the color term that precedes it in the sequence. Here's the breakdown per example:

1. ""lug dax bluf"" translates to ""blue green green"". ""Bluf"" takes the color from ""dax,"" which is green.

2. ""zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue"". ""Bluf"" takes the color from ""zup"", which is yellow.

3. ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red"". The first instance of ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and takes the color blue. When ""bluf"" appears again, it retains the color blue, despite ""zup"" preceding it.

4. ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"". ""Bluf"" takes the color from ""zup,"" which is yellow.

5. ""lug zup bluf dax"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow green"". ""Bluf"" takes the color from ""zup,"" which is yellow.

Rule: bluf -> Takes the color of the immediately preceding color word when it first appears; retains the same color upon subsequent appearances within the same sequence.
Based on the provided examples, we can induce a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" We need to consider the patterns and the number of times each color appears in the output relative to the presence of ""walm"" and the other words (""lug,"" ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup"").

Let's look at each example to try to understand what ""walm"" might mean:

1. lug walm -> blue blue blue
2. lug walm -> blue blue blue
3. wif dax lug walm -> red green blue blue blue
4. lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow
5. wif walm -> red red red

Here are some observations:
- ""walm"" results in a repetition of colors.
- ""walm"" appears to repeat the color that immediately precedes it three times.
- In examples 3 and 4, ""lug"" preceded ""walm,"" and the output had ""blue"" repeated three times.
- In example 5, ""wif"" preceded ""walm,"" and the output had ""red"" repeated three times. This implies that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word that comes directly before it.

Using these observations, the rule seems to be:
Rule: The word ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it three times.

Therefore:
walm -> repetition of the preceding color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: 'lug' translates to the color 'blue' in all provided examples.
Rule: dax -> green

Every instance of the word ""dax"" in the input corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's look at the common pattern in which it appears and the associated output.

In every instance where ""wif"" appears, it corresponds to the output ""red.""

Here are the consistencies I can observe:

- ""wif"" always translates to ""red.""
- Other words correspond with their own colors:
  - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
  - ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" as well but is repeated depending on the sequence it follows. In a sequence starting with ""wif"" or ""zup,"" ""walm"" translates to multiple ""red"" outputs.
  - ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red"" without repetition.
  - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
  - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Taking into account the repeating words and the consistent output, we can conclude that ""wif"" directly translates to the color ""red"" each time it appears without consideration for its position in the sequence or repetition.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that each non-nonce word corresponds to a specific color:

dax -> green
lug -> blue
wif -> red
walm -> green

In each example, the word zup is followed by a different color. However, irrespective of its position or the words around it, whenever zup is present, it outputs ""yellow"". There doesn't seem to be any variation or dependency on surrounding words or context for the word zup.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to analyze its occurrences and the corresponding output patterns:

1. zup bluf dax lug -> yellow yellow green blue
2. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
3. wif bluf dax -> red red green
4. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
5. wif dax zup wif dax bluf -> red green yellow red green green

If we compare the input containing ""bluf"" to the output, we notice the following mappings:

zup -> yellow
wif -> red
dax -> green
lug -> blue

From this mapping, we observe that ""bluf"" corresponds to different colors depending on its position and the words surrounding it:

1. In the first input, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"", and the output color is green, which corresponds to ""dax"".
2. In the second input, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and not followed by any other word, resulting in the output color red—identical to the output for ""wif"".
3. In the third input, ""bluf"" is in the middle and is surrounded by ""wif"" and ""dax"", with the output color for ""bluf"" being the same as the following word ""dax"" (green).

From the above observations, it seems ""bluf"" might adopt the color of the following word if present. The fourth input does not provide a conclusive pattern since ""bluf"" is the last word, and there is no word following ""bluf"". However, the output color red is the same as that of ""wif"".

However, the fifth example seems to break the pattern as ""bluf"" has words before and after it, with it corresponding to green, which isn't consistent with the previous rule of taking the color value of the immediate succeeding word (""dax""). Here ""bluf"" has taken the color of ""dax"" even though there's a ""wif"" in between them.

Given the last point, a definitive rule for ""bluf"" cannot be established with absolute certainty, but we can propose the following tentative rule based on the majority of examples:

Rule: When ""bluf"" is followed by another word, it takes on the color of the following word. If it is the last word with no words after it, it takes the color red. The last example creates ambiguity, suggesting that if ""dax"" appears anywhere after ""bluf"", it may still influence the color to green despite intermediate words.

Considering the ambiguity and mostly consistent pattern except for the last example, the most likely tentative rule for ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> When followed by another word, it takes on the color of that word, with a preference for the color green when ""dax"" follows it at any point. If it is the final word, the output is red.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the provided examples and the corresponding outputs.

1. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   Analysis: ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and results in a ""yellow"" output, matching the color associated with ""zup.""

2. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red
   Analysis: ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in a ""blue"" output, matching the color associated with ""lug.""

3. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   Analysis: ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in a ""blue"" output, same as the color associated with ""lug"" once again.

4. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow
   Analysis: ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and results in a ""red"" output, which is the same color associated with ""wif.""

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Analysis: ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and results in a ""green"" output, matching the color associated with ""dax.""

From these examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes the next word to be repeated in the output in the color associated with the word preceding ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> The next word after ""walm"" repeats its color output based on the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" in the given context. When ""lug"" is mentioned multiple times or combined with other words, it maintains its meaning as ""blue,"" and the sequence denotes the number of times ""blue"" should be said or the combination of colors that are to be mentioned.
Based on the inputs and outputs, we can determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax."" In every example where ""dax"" is used, the corresponding output is ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" at one instance but ""blue"" in another, possibly indicating ""bluf"" represents the color preceding it, as follows:
  - In ""lug bluf,"" ""bluf"" is blue, following the color of ""lug.""
  - In ""zup bluf,"" ""bluf"" is yellow, following the color of ""zup.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

When ""wif"" is introduced:

- In ""zup bluf wif walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow red red red"". ""Wif"" must correspond to ""red,"" and it seems to recursively repeat the color that follows it. ""Walm"" has no defined output color but seems to repeat itself.
- In ""lug bluf wif lug bluf zup,"" the output is ""blue blue red blue blue yellow"". Here ""wif"" again corresponds to red, but it also seems to follow the rule that it takes the color after it and repeats it.
- In ""dax wif lug,"" the output is ""green red blue."" Here ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and then the color following it is ""blue.""
- In ""dax walm wif walm,"" the output is ""green green green red red red."" ""Wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" which indicates tripling the output of the color.
- In ""dax wif bluf,"" the output is ""green red red."" Again, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" which we've determined adapts the color preceding it, hence two reds after ""wif.""

Here we can induce the rule for ""wif"":

""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"" but also serves as a repeater for the color that immediately follows it. If the following word/color is not defined (e.g., ""walm""), ""wif"" seems to just adopt the color red and continue repeating it.

Rule: wif -> ""red"" and repeat the subsequent color. If the subsequent color is undefined or not demonstrated in the examples, then repeat ""red"".
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" is a nonce word that corresponds to a specific color in the output sequence. However, in order to understand the rule governing ""zup,"" we need to look for patterns in the input-output pairs.

Let's examine each example:

1. wif zup -> red yellow
2. dax wif dax zup bluf -> green red green yellow yellow
3. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
4. lug walm zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow red
5. zup bluf wif lug dax -> yellow yellow red blue green

Looking at these examples, we see that:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" also corresponds to ""blue""

Using these correlations, let's try to discern the pattern for ""zup"":

- In example 1, zup comes after ""wif"" and the result is ""yellow."" There is nothing to compare it to.
- In example 2, zup comes after ""dax wif dax,"" which corresponds to ""green red green,"" and it results in ""yellow,"" the same as in example 1.
- In example 3, zup is followed by ""dax bluf"" and it gives ""yellow green green,"" with ""yellow"" appearing in the same position as zup does in the input.
- In example 4, zup comes third in the sequence and results in ""yellow,"" while ""lug walm"" both correspond to ""blue blue.""
- In example 5, zup is the first word, and ""yellow"" is again the first color in the output sequence.

Given that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words, the rule seems straightforward:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples given, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a color:

- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue.

The word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color red when followed by ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue.

Using this information, it's possible to form the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> red when followed by ""lug,"" otherwise it is not clear what ""bluf"" means on its own since there's no example provided with ""bluf"" without ""lug"" following it.
To deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""walm,"" let's first look for patterns in the given examples:

1. ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" -> ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow""
2. ""wif walm zup walm"" -> ""red red red yellow yellow yellow""
3. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
4. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" -> ""red red green green red red red blue red""
5. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""

Here's what we can deduce from the examples:

- Each ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
- Each ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
- ""walm"" by itself does not have a consistent color.
- When ""walm"" follows another word, it causes that word to repeat its color output.

Now let's apply these patterns:

- In the first example, we see that ""wif walm zup"" translates to ""red red red yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" after ""wif"" causes the ""red"" to repeat before moving on to ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""wif walm zup walm"" results in ""red red red yellow yellow yellow,"" supporting our conclusion that ""walm"" repeats the previous word's color.
- In the third and fifth examples, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" which is consistent with our findings.
- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" results in various colors, but when ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" it leads to the repetition of ""red"" before moving on to ""blue,"" which is associated with ""lug.""

Rule: walm -> causes the previous word's color to repeat

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,101
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> repeats the color word that comes immediately after it one extra time.

Rule: When ""lug"" precedes a color word, that color word is repeated once.
Rule: dax -> green

The presence of the word ""dax"" in the input consistently leads to the output including the word ""green,"" regardless of the positioning or other words surrounding ""dax."" The other words in the input correspond to different colors: lug -> blue, wif -> red, bluf -> blue, zup -> yellow, walm -> yellow. Therefore, ""dax"" likely means ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Additionally, when other nonce words are placed before ""wif,"" they each correspond to different colors that precede ""red"" in the output sequence. Here is the apparent pattern:

- The word ""wif"" by itself corresponds to ""red.""
- The word ""zup"" when used before ""wif"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- The word ""dax"" when used before ""wif"" corresponds to ""green.""
- When ""dax"" and ""zup"" are combined before ""wif,"" their corresponding colors are sequenced as ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""yellow"" for ""zup,"" followed by ""red"" for ""wif.""
- The position of ""wif"" among other words seems crucial—as in the fourth example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" corresponds to ""red red green green green."" While it's not clear what ""bluf"" or ""walm"" individually correspond to, it appears that the placement of ""wif"" before them dictates that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax walm"" to ""green green green.""

The sequence in which these words appear affects the sequence and repetition of the colors in the output.

Rule: wif corresponds to the color red. The presence of other words before ""wif"" adds additional colors to the sequence, preceding ""red,"" based on a pattern unique to each nonce word.
From the given examples, we can deduce the following:

1. Whenever the word ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow"".
2. ""zup"" does not appear to depend on its position within the input sequence to determine its output, as it always results in ""yellow"" regardless of where it is placed.

Based on this information, the rule appears to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow

Meaning that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"".
Based on the given examples, each time the nonce word ""bluf"" appears, it corresponds to the colour that is represented by the word immediately preceding it.

Input: dax zup wif bluf lug => Output: green yellow red red blue
Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", which corresponds to the colour ""red"". Therefore, ""bluf"" takes the colour ""red"".

Input: zup bluf => Output: yellow yellow
Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", which corresponds to the colour ""yellow"". Therefore, ""bluf"" takes the colour ""yellow"".

Input: lug bluf wif => Output: blue blue red
Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", which corresponds to the colour ""blue"". Therefore, ""bluf"" takes the colour ""blue"".

Input: lug walm wif bluf => Output: blue blue blue red red
Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", which corresponds to the colour ""red"". Therefore, ""bluf"" takes the colour ""red"".

Input: wif bluf => Output: red red
Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", which corresponds to the colour ""red"". Therefore, ""bluf"" takes the colour ""red"".

Rule: bluf -> The meaning of ""bluf"" is the colour of the word that directly precedes it.
Analyzing the examples provided, each instance of the word ""walm"" is followed by a sequence of ""green."" The number of times ""green"" appears varies; however, it seems to be dependent on the words that appear before ""walm."" Specifically, the number of unique words that precede ""walm"" in each sentence dictates the number of ""green"" occurrences in the output. Here is the pattern as I interpret it:

1. Input: ""dax walm wif bluf"" | Output: ""green green green red red""
   - ""dax"" is before ""walm"" → ""green"" appears three times.
   
2. Input: ""lug wif dax walm zup"" | Output: ""blue red green green green yellow""
   - ""lug,"" ""wif,"" ""dax"" are before ""walm"" → ""green"" appears three times.

3. Input: ""zup lug walm"" | Output: ""yellow blue blue blue""
   - ""zup,"" ""lug"" are before ""walm"" → ""green"" appears twice.

4. Input: ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" | Output: ""blue green yellow green green green red""
   - ""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""zup"" are before ""walm,"" and despite ""dax"" appearing twice, it is only counted once → ""green"" appears three times.

5. Input: ""dax lug walm"" | Output: ""green blue blue blue""
   - ""dax,"" ""lug"" are before ""walm"" → ""green"" appears twice.

From these observations, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: ""walm"" signifies a repetition of the word ""green"" in the output, with the number of repetitions being equal to the count of distinct words preceding ""walm"" in the input.

Hence, walm -> meaning rule: For every unique word that precedes ""walm,"" output ""green"" once for each of those unique words.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup walm dax wif lug
    ",Output: green yellow green green green green red blue,green yellow yellow yellow green red blue,False,102
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning: color blue

Rule: When the word 'lug' is present in the input, it corresponds to the color 'blue' in the output. Regardless of its position in the input, 'lug' always translates to 'blue' in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in each instance it is used across the examples.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" is present in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output sequence. This correspondence remains consistent regardless of wif's position within the input string.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following patterns:

- Whenever ""zup"" is presented alone, the output is ""yellow"".
- ""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green"".
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""walm"" also corresponds to ""green"", just like ""dax"".
- ""wif"" corresponds with ""red"".
- When ""zup"" appears again at the end of the line, as in the last example, it triggers a repetition of the sequence ""yellow blue"".

Given these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""zup"" appears to function as a signal or command word that produces ""yellow"" when presented and also affects the sequence by repeating a pattern when it appears again. The meaning of ""zup"" seems to be tied to eliciting the color ""yellow"" as output and possibly influencing sequence repetition. 

Therefore, the rule for zup can be stated as:

zup -> yellow (and can influence a pattern repetition when repeated in the sequence).
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's first look at the pairs of inputs and outputs given in the examples:

1. wif zup bluf lug -> red yellow yellow blue
2. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
3. dax lug bluf -> green blue blue
4. wif lug bluf -> red blue blue
5. lug wif bluf -> blue red red

Now we will analyze the patterns. Looking at the second example (zup bluf -> yellow yellow), we see that both ""zup"" and ""bluf"" result in the word ""yellow."" This suggests that ""bluf"" might mean ""yellow"" since the only other word in the input is the same ""zup,"" which also translates to ""yellow.""

However, if we explore the other examples, we find instances where ""bluf"" results in the word ""blue."" For instance, in the third input (dax lug bluf -> green blue blue), ""dax"" results in ""green"" and ""lug"" in ""blue,"" but the presence of ""bluf"" still results in ""blue"" at the end.

In the fourth input, (wif lug bluf -> red blue blue), ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" ""lug"" again to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" also translates to ""blue.""

In the fifth input (lug wif bluf -> blue red red), ""lug"" converts to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" but the occurrence of ""bluf"" produces a ""red,"" which is different from the previous patterns.

Given these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" might be taking on the color of the noun immediately preceding it. Specifically, when ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" it translates to ""blue,"" and when it follows ""wif,"" it becomes ""red."" In the case it follows ""zup,"" it is ""yellow."" 

However, the fifth example is an exception where the ""bluf"" that follows ""wif"" doesn't translate into ""red"" as it did in the fourth example; instead, it repeats the color (red) assigned to the preceding noun pair (lug wif), suggesting that perhaps ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it but in the context of the noun pairs from the examples given.

Hence, a tentative rule for ""bluf"" might be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> takes the color of the preceding word in the noun pair.

But since there is an exception to the potential rule in the fifth example, there may not be enough information or there might be exceptions to the rule, or the rule might involve a more complex pattern that would require additional examples to discern accurately.
Rule: The nonce word 'walm' indicates a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. For 'zup' the color is yellow, for 'dax' it is green, and for 'lug' it is blue. The repetition is threefold unless followed or preceded by 'wif' which adds a 'red' to the sequence.

walm -> repetition of the associated color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup dax zup
    ",Output: red yellow green yellow blue,red yellow green yellow,False,103
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples, every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding output. There are no examples that contradict this relationship, and the word ""dax"" appears to be functionally equivalent to the color word ""green"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence.
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. Every time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
From the examples provided, we can see that ""bluf"" corresponds to a repeated color output. The specific color that it corresponds to is determined by the preceding word. Each word before ""bluf"" seems to be associated with a specific color, as shown below:

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow

When ""bluf"" follows these words, the output is the color associated with the preceding word, repeated. For example:

- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red""
- ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue""

Accordingly, we can deduce:

bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: If the preceding word is ""wif,"" ""bluf"" means ""red red."" If the preceding word is ""lug,"" ""bluf"" means ""blue blue."" If the preceding word is ""dax,"" ""bluf"" means ""green green."" If the preceding word is ""zup,"" ""bluf"" means ""yellow yellow.""
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze its usage and its corresponding outputs in the given examples. 

In the first example, ""wif zup walm dax zup"" translates to ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow."" We observe that ""walm"" is followed by three yellows and then a color corresponding to the next word (dax -> green).

In the second example, ""dax walm"" becomes ""green green green."" Here, ""walm"" produces three greens, which is consistent with the color for ""dax.""

The third example supports this pattern: ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" translates to ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow."" Again, ""walm"" is followed by three reds after ""wif,"" and at the end of the input, ""walm"" after ""zup"" translates to three yellows.

The fourth example, ""lug walm,"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" once more showing that ""walm"" results in three repetitions of the preceding word's color (""lug"" -> blue).

The last example aligns with the established pattern: ""zup lug walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue,"" where ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and produces three blues, corresponding to ""lug.""

Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times.

To succinctly state it:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the preceding word's corresponding color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif bluf
    ",Output: green red red,green red red,True,104
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Each instance of the word ""lug"" corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's analyze the provided examples and outputs to see if there's a pattern that connects the two.

Looking at the examples:

1. Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
   Output: red red yellow red blue green
   
2. Input: wif dax
   Output: red green
   
3. Input: dax lug bluf wif
   Output: green blue blue red
   
4. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow green yellow green red red

5. Input: dax walm zup walm
   Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

Comparing the inputs and outputs, we can establish that each input word corresponds to a particular color in the output. The known words wif, bluf, zup, and lug consistently correspond to red, blue, yellow, and blue, respectively.

Now, let's analyze the occurrences of ""dax"":

1. In the first instance, ""dax"" appears as the last word and is output as green.
2. In the second instance, ""dax"" follows ""wif"" (red) and is output as green.
3. In the third instance, ""dax"" appears as the first word and is output as green.
4. In the fourth instance, ""dax"" is alternated with ""zup"" (yellow) and each instance of ""dax"" outputs green.
5. In the fifth instance, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" which has no previous known output, but ""dax"" still corresponds to green both times it appears.

From these examples, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the input or the words around it. It appears that ""dax"" is independent of context since it always maps to green despite varying surrounding words.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" is in the input, ""red"" is in the corresponding position in the output. Other words are associated with other colors, such as ""zup"" with ""yellow"" and ""lug"" with ""blue."" 

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, when ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" is added to the output for the subsequent term in the sequence. Each non-zup word seems to have its own corresponding color:

- bluf -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- walm -> blue (repeated for the number of times 'walm' appears in sequence)
- wif -> red (also repeated for the number of times 'wif' appears in sequence)

When ""zup"" appears before each of these words, it appears to act as a prefix that adds an additional ""yellow"" to the sequence of colors associated with the word that follows it.

Here is the observed pattern:

- zup bluf: ""zup"" adds a ""yellow"" before ""bluf"", which is also ""yellow"". Therefore, the output is ""yellow yellow"".
- zup lug walm: ""zup"" adds a ""yellow"" before ""lug"", which is ""blue"", and ""walm"" is ""blue blue blue"". Hence, the output is ""yellow blue blue blue"".
- lug wif zup wif walm: ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""wif"" is ""red"", ""zup"" adds a ""yellow"" before another ""wif"", which is ""red red"" (since ""wif"" appears twice in a row), and ""walm"" is ""red"" (as it appears once here). Thus, the output is ""blue red yellow red red red"".
- lug walm zup walm: ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""walm"" is ""blue blue"", ""zup"" adds a ""yellow"" before another ""walm"", which is ""blue blue blue"". So, the output is ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow"".
- zup lug walm wif walm: ""zup"" adds a ""yellow"" before ""lug"", which is ""blue"", ""walm"" is ""blue blue blue"", ""wif"" is ""red"", and ""walm"" is ""red red"". Accordingly, the output is ""yellow blue blue blue red red red"".

Thus, the rule for zup seems to be:

zup -> Add ""yellow"" in the output before translating the next word into its corresponding color.

Rule: If the word following ""zup"" is known and translates to a sequence of colors, add a ""yellow"" to the beginning of this sequence. If ""zup"" appears before a word that repeats, it only affects the sequence of colors for the immediate next term, not subsequent repetitions of that term unless stated otherwise by additional instances of ""zup"".
Based on the provided examples, we can see that the presence of the word ""bluf"" leads to the word ""green"" being output multiple times. In every case, the appearance of ""bluf"" seems to generate an extra instance of the word ""green"", except for when it stands alone, where it only generates a single ""green"". However, this single instance of ""green"" could be the 'extra' instance, compared to the lack of output when there's no input at all.

Here's the deduced pattern:

1. When ""bluf"" is present with at least one other word that has a corresponding output, it leads to the output of an additional ""green"" before the color that corresponds with the next word.
  
2. When ""bluf"" is present with no following word that has a corresponding color output, it results in a single instance of ""green"".

Therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" in this context could be a rule or command to precede the next color with green, or if there is no next color, to simply produce ""green"". Hence, the induction of the rule considering the given examples is:

Rule: ""bluf"" causes the output of ""green"" before the color associated with the following word, or results in a single ""green"" if there is no following word.
Analyzing the provided examples, each input word corresponds to a color in the output. The colors associated with ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug"" seem consistent in all examples, suggesting that ""walm"" also corresponds to a specific color. By examining the outputs for ""walm,"" I notice that it seems to repeat the color of the previous word a variable number of times. 

Let's look at the patterns more closely:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   (The color green repeats three times after ""walm."")

2. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red 
   (The color yellow repeats three times after ""walm."")

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   (The color blue repeats three times after ""walm."")

4. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   (The color yellow (from ""zup"") repeats three times after ""walm."")

5. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red
   (The color blue repeats three times after ""walm."")

In all examples, ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the previous color three times. Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be replicating the color associated with the preceding word exactly three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow,yellow yellow yellow,True,105
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Explanation: In each example where the word ""lug"" appears, the output consistently includes the word ""blue."" Therefore, it can be deduced that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.

- Input: ""lug dax"" outputs ""blue green,"" with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue.""
- Input: ""lug"" by itself outputs ""blue.""
- Input: ""dax wif lug"" outputs ""green red blue,"" with ""lug"" still corresponding to ""blue.""
- Input: ""zup lug"" outputs ""yellow blue,"" with ""lug"" again corresponding to ""blue.""
- Input: ""lug wif dax"" outputs ""blue red green,"" with ""lug"" once more corresponding to ""blue.""

Thus, based on the examples provided, ""lug"" consistently represents the color blue.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples provided, whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding output. This consistent one-to-one mapping indicates that ""dax"" means ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples:

Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif  
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug  
Output: blue red green green red blue

Input: zup wif dax walm lug  
Output: yellow red green green green blue

Input: dax lug dax wif dax  
Output: green blue green red green

Input: wif  
Output: red

From the examples, we can see that the word ""wif"" always corresponds to the color ""red,"" regardless of the position in the sequence or the other words present.

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> ""yellow"" added before each subsequent word. 

When ""zup"" is present, it adds the word ""yellow"" before every word that follows it.

- For ""zup wif,"" ""wif"" means ""red,"" so the output is ""yellow red.""
- For ""zup walm wif,"" if ""walm"" has no assigned output, we can assume it's a part of the pattern, repeating ""yellow"" for each ""walm"" before adding ""red"" for ""wif,"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow red.""
- For ""wif zup,"" the first ""red"" is for ""wif,"" followed by the ""yellow"" for ""zup,"" so the output is ""red yellow.""
- For ""zup lug,"" ""lug"" is assumed to mean ""blue,"" with the presence of ""zup"" adding ""yellow"" before it, resulting in ""yellow blue.""
- When only ""zup"" is given, it corresponds to just ""yellow.""
Given the examples, it seems that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color as the output. 

Let's analyze the examples one by one:

1. ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" corresponds to ""green yellow blue yellow yellow"". Since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", we can infer that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

2. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" corresponds to ""green red yellow yellow red red red"". Since we know ""dax,"" ""wif,"" and ""zup"" correspond to ""green,"" ""red,"" and ""yellow,"" respectively, ""bluf"" again corresponds to ""yellow"" in this sequence. We also see that ""wif"" appears twice and corresponds to ""red"" both times, and while ""walm"" is a new term, its output ""red"" is beside ""wif,"" suggesting a relationship or a repeated pattern.

3. ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green"". Since we know ""dax"" means ""green,"" and the output for ""bluf"" here is ""green,"" this is consistent with our previous discovery of ""bluf"" meaning ""yellow"". The rule might be that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word before it unless it's the first word.

4. ""lug bluf zup"" corresponds to ""blue blue yellow"". Here, since ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and the output for ""bluf"" again is ""blue,"" this supports the idea that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word before it.

5. ""wif dax zup bluf"" corresponds to ""red green yellow yellow"". We know that ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup"" correspond to ""red,"" ""green,"" and ""yellow,"" respectively, and since ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and has the output ""yellow,"" this again supports the rule.

Given this information, we can infer the rule for ""bluf"":

bluf -> meaning: Bluf takes the color of the previous word in the sequence. If bluf is the first word, then it is ""green"".

Rule: The color for ""bluf"" is determined by the color of the word preceding it; if no word precedes ""bluf,"" the default color is green.
Based on the examples given, the word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the immediately preceding word's output. Here are the observations supporting this:

1. In the first example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green.""
2. In the second example, ""dax walm"" again translates to ""green green green.""
3. In the third example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" which supports the pattern.
4. In the fourth example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" following the repetition pattern.
5. In the fifth example, ""lug walm"" equals ""blue blue blue,"" again consistent with the previous pattern.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the immediately preceding word's output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"", we will look at each instance it appears in the examples and the corresponding output color:

1. dax walm wif zup -> green green green red yellow
2. dax walm wif lug dax walm -> green green green red blue green green green
3. dax -> green
4. dax -> green
5. dax lug zup dax -> green blue yellow green

Looking at the examples, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words that come after it.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

dax -> green 
Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the output sequence, irrespective of its position or surrounding words.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Regardless of other words in the input, ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red"".
zup -> yellow. 

Rule: The word zup consistently corresponds to the color yellow in each given example.
Based on the examples provided, the word 'bluf' can be inferred to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. 

When 'lug' is followed by 'bluf', the word 'blue' is repeated twice. When 'dax' is followed by 'bluf', the word 'green' is repeated twice, and when 'zup' is followed by 'bluf', 'yellow' is repeated.

Hence, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the previous word
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can examine the patterns in each example where the word is used and the output that corresponds with it.

1. In the first example, a sequence of ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red."" Here, ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

2. In the second example, ""zup walm lug"" gives us ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" We can see that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue,"" which is consistent with the first example.

3. In the third example, ""zup walm wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow red."" Again, ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""wif"" is ""red.""

4. In the fourth example, ""dax lug walm"" gives us ""green blue blue blue."" We haven't seen ""dax"" before, but it seems to correspond to ""green."" ""lug"" is again consistent with ""blue.""

5. In the fifth example, ""lug wif walm"" translates to ""blue red red red."" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""wif"" is ""red.""

In all cases, ""walm"" follows a pattern where it repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. For instance, when ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (which means ""blue""), the output color is ""blue."" When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (""yellow""), the output is ""yellow,"" and so on.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the word before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the output across all provided examples.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs provided.
Given the examples provided, each instance of the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to a color in the Output. By cross-referencing each instance of ""wif"" and the colors that follow, we attempt to deduce the rule for what ""wif"" means.

Let's analyze each line:

1. Input: dax bluf wif
   Output: green green red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red.

2. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
   Output: red yellow yellow red green
   - The first ""wif"" corresponds to red, and the second ""wif"" corresponds to red as well.

3. Input: wif bluf dax lug
   Output: red red green blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red.

4. Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
   Output: blue red red green blue blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red.

5. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red.

Based on the examples provided, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red. Each time ""wif"" is mentioned in the Input, the Output contains the color red in the equivalent position.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Every time ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output. In addition to this direct correlation, the other words before ""zup"" seem to correspond to other colors. ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"". The order of colors in the output follows the order of words in the input except for the last example where ""zup"" comes before ""lug"" but ""yellow"" still follows ""blue"".

zup -> yellow

Rule:
- Each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output.
- The color ""yellow"" is always represented by the word ""zup.""
Based on the given examples, the output appears to be color names that correspond to the nonce words provided in the input. Specifically, we can deduce that the nonce word ""bluf"" results in the output of a color name that is repeated twice.

For example:

1. Input: lug bluf => Output: blue blue (The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the word ""blue"" repeated twice.)
2. Input: zup wif bluf => Output: yellow red red (The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the word ""red"" repeated twice.)
3. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif => Output: yellow blue red green green red (The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the word ""green"" repeated twice.)
4. Input: zup bluf wif lug dax => Output: yellow yellow red blue green (The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the word ""yellow"" repeated twice.)
5. Input: dax zup wif bluf lug => Output: green yellow red red blue (The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the word ""red"" repeated twice.)

From these examples, it is clear that ""bluf"" takes the color that is next to it in the output and repeats it, indicating that the rule for ""bluf"" is to repeat the first adjacent color word in the output.

Rule: 
bluf -> Repeat the color word that immediately follows it in the output. If there is no color word immediately following ""bluf,"" then the color word preceding ""bluf"" is repeated. If ""bluf"" is at the end, no color word follows, and hence the color word immediately preceding it is repeated.
To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in the examples provided:

1. Each instance of ""walm"" corresponds to a series of the same color in the output.
2. The color before ""walm"" in the input does not necessarily match the series of colors generated by ""walm"" in the output.
3. The number of times the color is repeated seems to depend on the number of words preceding ""walm"" in the input string.

Let's examine each line to understand the pattern:

- In the first line, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and ""zup."" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, but ""walm"" generates ""red"" three times, indicating the repetition is not related to the color preceding it.
- In the second line, ""walm"" is repeated three times after ""lug,"" which also corresponds to blue, and produces ""blue"" three times.
- In the third line, there is a sequence of colors where ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""wif"" to red. The word ""walm"" comes after these and results in green being repeated, likely because ""dax"" was the first word after the last ""lug.""
- In the fourth line, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" follows a ""zup"" and results in three repetitions of ""yellow.""
- In the fifth line, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""dax"" to green, ""lug"" to blue, and ""walm"" follows a ""lug."" After ""walm,"" ""zup"" and ""lug"" occur, and the output is blue, followed by more ""blue"" from ""lug.""

Rule:
The repetition caused by ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the word that directly precedes ""walm,"" and the number of repetitions is equal to the number of different words preceding ""walm"" since the previous occurrence of ""walm"" (or the start of the input if it's the first ""walm"" in the input).

Thus, ""walm"" -> results in repeating the color corresponding to the word just before ""walm,"" and the number of repetitions equals the count of unique words between this ""walm"" and the previous ""walm"" (or the start of the string).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,108
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Rule: lug translates to the word ""blue.""
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we must look at the correlation between its use and the sequence of colors in the output. Here's a breakdown of the evidence provided in the examples:

1. ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" -> ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow""
2. ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" -> ""green green red yellow blue""
3. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
4. ""dax lug"" -> ""green blue""
5. ""dax zup walm wif walm"" -> ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red""

From these examples, we can infer two things:

Firstly, we see that every sequence starts with ""green,"" suggesting that ""dax"" at the beginning of a sequence correlates to the initial ""green.""

Secondly, the occurrences of other colors seem to be influenced by the words that come after ""dax."" Whenever a new word is introduced, it is followed by a series of the same color, the number of which matches the number of times that word has appeared in the sequence including the current instance.

Here's a possible rule structure based on the examples:

- ""dax"" at the start -> ""green""
- ""wif"" upon first usage -> ""red"", twice -> two ""red"" and so on.
- ""walm"" upon first usage -> ""yellow"", twice -> two ""yellow"" and so on.
- ""lug"" upon first usage -> ""blue"", not repeated in the given examples.
- ""bluf"" upon first usage -> ""green"", not repeated in the given examples.
- ""zup"" upon first usage -> ""yellow"", twice -> two ""yellow"" and so on.

Now defining the rule of ""dax"":

Rule: ""dax"" results in an initial ""green"" and sets up a structure where the following words determine the sequence and repetition of colors. Each unique word after ""dax"" has a corresponding color, and the number of times that color is shown corresponds to the number of times the word appears in the sequence up to that point.
wif -> meaning. The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".

Rule: Every time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" is included in the corresponding output.
To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look at the way it corresponds to different outputs in the given examples:

Input: zup dax wif zup
Output: yellow green red yellow
- Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" at both the beginning and the end of the sequence.

Input: zup dax zup
Output: yellow green yellow
- ""zup"" again corresponds to ""yellow"" at both the beginning and end, with ""dax"" corresponding to ""green.""

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and it is followed by ""walm"" which also corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" at the end corresponds to ""red.""

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
- ""wif"" starts with ""red,"" then ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" followed by ""bluf"" and ""lug"" which correspond to ""yellow blue"" repeated, ""walm"" is again ""blue"" (although it was ""yellow"" when following ""zup""), ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""lug"" again is ""blue.""

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red
- ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" is ""red.""

From these examples, we can see that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence. There does not seem to be any dependency on context for the meaning of ""zup."" Therefore, the rule we can induce is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, we can see that each occurrence of ""bluf"" is translated into the color ""red."" Here are the observations supporting this:

- Every instance where ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
- In examples where ""bluf"" is repeated, so is the word ""red.""
- ""Bluf"" does not depend on position; wherever it appears in the sequence, the output is ""red.""

Hence, from the patterns observed, we can deduce the rule as follows:

bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
To deduce the meaning of walm, we need to look at the patterns of outputs concerning its presence in the input.

- When ""dax walm"" appears, the output is ""green green green"". ""Dax"" alone generates ""green"", so ""walm"" may be reinforcing or extending the green output by two additional greens.
- When ""lug walm"" appears, the output is ""blue blue blue"". ""Lug"" alone isn't given, but given this output, we might hypothesize that ""lug"" generates a blue, and similar to the ""dax"" case, ""walm"" extends the blue by two additional blues.
- ""Lug walm zup"" gives us ""blue blue blue yellow"", which suggests ""zup"" generates a yellow and ""walm"" might be responsible for the two additional blues following ""lug"".
- ""Dax lug walm"" outputting ""green blue blue blue"" indicates that ""walm"" extends the color of the word before it by three of that same color, since ""dax"" generates green and ""lug"" is hypothesized to generate blue.
- Lastly ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"", ""zup"" generates yellow, ""walm"" again extends that color by two more yellows, ""lug"" goes to blue, and ""wif"" causes a switch to red, suggesting a two-color extension, although ""bluf"" doesn't seem to match with a color, it might be another control word or context-dependent. 

walm -> meaning. Rule: The word ""walm"" extends the output color of the word immediately preceding it by two additional instances of that color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow blue,yellow yellow yellow blue,True,109
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following color correspondences:

- wif -> red
- bluf -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- walm -> yellow

Now, let's focus on ""lug"":

1. Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
   - Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""lug"" likely corresponds to ""blue.""

2. Input: wif bluf lug zup -> Output: red red blue yellow
   - ""wif"" and ""bluf"" both correspond to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" so ""lug"" again appears to correspond to ""blue.""

3. Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> Output: red red yellow red blue green
   - Following the previously established correspondences, the occurrence of ""lug"" aligns with ""blue"" once more.

4. Input: lug wif dax zup walm -> Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" matches ""red,"" ""dax"" matches ""green,"" and ""zup"" and ""walm"" match ""yellow."" Since ""lug"" appears at the start and ""blue"" is the first color in the output, it supports our rule that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

5. Input: zup dax lug walm zup -> Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   - ""zup"" matches ""yellow,"" ""dax"" matches ""green,"" and ""walm"" matches ""yellow."" Given that ""lug"" is followed by two more ""blue"" in the output sequence, it appears that ""lug"" indeed corresponds to ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the input and corresponding output sequences, it appears that the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green."" Here are the observations from the given examples:

- In the first example, ""dax zup"" translates to ""green yellow,"" suggesting that ""dax"" means ""green"" since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""green red yellow yellow red red red."" We see that ""dax"" is consistently translated to ""green,"" just like in the first example.
- In the third and fourth examples, ""dax"" continues to be translated to ""green,"" which reinforces the idea that it stands for the color green.
- The fifth example, ""zup wif dax walm,"" is translated to ""yellow red green green green."" ""Dax"" occupies the position that is translated as ""green,"" further corroborating its meaning.

Therefore, based on the indications from the examples, the rule seems to be:
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the following pattern can be observed:

- Whenever the word ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red"".
- The other words correspond to different colors in the output, but ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"".

Thus, the rule seems to be:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the output.
zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow.""
Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to consistently map to the color ""blue."" Regardless of position or surrounding words, every instance of ""bluf"" in the input always results in ""blue"" in the output.

Rule: bluf -> blue
By examining the provided examples and their corresponding outputs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""walm."" We can look at the association between the position of ""walm"" in the input and the color sequence in the output:

1. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" produces an output of ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""lug."" 

2. ""zup walm lug wif"" produces an output of ""yellow yellow yellow blue red."" This is similar to the first example but without ""bluf"" at the end.

3. ""lug walm wif"" produces ""blue blue blue red."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug.""

4. ""zup wif walm"" produces ""yellow red red red."" In this case, ""walm"" is the last word.

5. ""zup walm wif"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow red."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""wif.""

Looking at these patterns, we notice that whenever ""walm"" appears after ""zup,"" the immediate output following is a repetition of ""yellow."" If it appears at the end of the string, the output is ""red."" Further, when ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is a repetition of ""blue.""

Based on this analysis, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color word associated with the preceding word to repeat until a new color word is introduced or the input sequence ends. If ""walm"" is the last word in the input, it results in ""red.""

Therefore:

walm -> Causes the color associated with the previous word to repeat in the output until a new color word is encountered. If ""walm"" is the last word, the output is ""red.""

Rule: If ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is multiple ""yellow"" until the next color word or end of the sequence. If ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is multiple ""blue"" until the next color word or end of the sequence. If ""walm"" is at the end, the output is ""red.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the provided examples, every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
Based on the given examples, it is possible to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by observing the output in relation to the input. Here's what we can infer from the examples:

- Each instance of ""wif"" in the input has a corresponding ""red"" in the output.
- Other words in the input correspond to different colors in the output, with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" corresponding to ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" corresponding to ""green.""

Therefore, we can deduce the meaning of ""wif"" in this specific context:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: Every time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the output is ""yellow"".
Rule: The word ""bluf"" results in repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. 

Evidence for this rule:

1. ""wif bluf"" => ""red red"" (The word ""bluf"" repeats the color for ""wif."")
2. ""dax bluf"" => ""green green"" (The word ""bluf"" repeats the color for ""dax."")
3. ""lug wif lug bluf"" => ""blue red blue blue"" (The word ""bluf"" repeats the color for ""lug."")
4. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" => ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red"" (""bluf"" repeats the color for ""wif"".)
5. ""wif bluf dax lug"" => ""red red green blue"" (""bluf"" again repeats the color for ""wif"".) 

bluf -> repeating the color of the preceding word.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we look for patterns in each example and the corresponding output:

- When ""wif walm dax zup"" appears, the output is ""red red red green yellow."" 
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
  - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
  
- When ""lug walm zup"" appears, the output is ""blue blue blue yellow.""
  - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
  - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

- When ""zup bluf wif walm"" appears, the output is ""yellow yellow red red red.""
  - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
  - ""bluf"" potentially corresponds to ""yellow"" or ""red""—this needs further evidence
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

- When ""lug walm"" appears, the output is ""blue blue blue.""
  - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

- When ""zup lug walm wif walm"" appears, the output is ""yellow blue blue blue red red red.""
  - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
  - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Based on these patterns, ""walm"" seems to cause the output of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it, repeating that color three times.

Rule: walm -> The meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times. For example, if the previous word translates to ""blue,"" then ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word corresponds to a color. The word ""dax"" consistently results in the color ""green."" Therefore, we can deduce the meaning of ""dax"" in this context.

dax -> meaning. Rule: dax = green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"". In every instance where ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red"" corresponding to its position in the input.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"". No matter the position of ""zup"" in the input string, the corresponding output is always ""yellow"". Other words in the examples, like ""bluf,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug,"" also correlate with specific colors (""red,"" ""green,"" and ""blue,"" respectively) and their output is consistent regardless of their position as well.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" is associated with the word ""green"" consistently when it follows ""dax,"" and associated with the word ""red"" when it follows ""wif."" When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the association is with the word ""red"" in the first instance, and ""yellow"" in the second instance. This inconsistency in the case of ""zup"" may indicate multiple rules or a context-based meaning for ""bluf.""

The overlapping rule for ""bluf"" when following ""dax"" and ""wif"" is the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" However, the behavior when following ""zup"" is inconsistent and does not fit the pattern of simple repetition.

Let's analyze further with a focus on ""zup"":

- Input: zup dax bluf - Output: yellow green green
- Input: zup wif bluf - Output: yellow red red
- Input: zup bluf - Output: yellow red red
- Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax - Output: green green yellow yellow green

In the last example, ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow,"" which indicates that the second ""bluf"" might simply be repeating the color associated with the word ""zup."" When ""bluf"" is directly preceded by ""zup,"" it appears the meaning of ""bluf"" becomes ""red,"" and when followed by another ""bluf,"" it repeats the color it has come to represent. However, the lack of more examples with different preceding words makes this pattern tentative at best.

Without more data, we cannot conclusively define a unique meaning for ""bluf,"" and we have not yet established a complete rule. Here is an observation based on the given examples:

Rule: ""bluf"" often repeats the color of the word that precedes it, with the following patterns observed: ""dax bluf"" -> green green, ""wif bluf"" -> red red. However, the word ""zup"" introduces a discrepancy, as ""zup bluf"" can result in ""yellow red"" or ""yellow yellow,"" suggesting a conditional or context-sensitive rule or that ""bluf"" has more than one meaning that is determined by its position or surrounding context. More examples would be needed to fully deduce the rule or meaning of ""bluf.""
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let’s look at the output colors for each input containing the word ""walm"" and try to find the pattern.

1. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
2. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
3. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
4. zup wif dax walm -> yellow red green green green
5. dax walm -> green green green

The rule seems to correlate with the repetition of the color associated with the word that appears immediately before ""walm"" in the input:

1. walm follows 'wif' associated with red, and the output is three reds (one red is for 'wif' and additional two for 'walm').
2. walm follows 'lug' associated with blue, and the output is four blues (one blue for 'lug' and additional three for 'walm').
3. walm follows 'zup' associated with yellow, and the output is three yellows (one yellow for 'zup' and additional two for 'walm').
4. In the presence of multiple words, it appears the rule for 'walm' applies only to the color of the word directly before it (green), resulting in two additional greens for 'walm'.
5. When 'dax' precedes 'walm', three greens appear (one green for 'dax' and additional two for 'walm').

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats or amplifies the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it, with the instance of the word 'walm' itself generating two additional instances of the color.

Rule: ""walm"" means repeat the color associated with the preceding word two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. 

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears, it corresponds to the color blue.
Based on the examples provided:

- ""zup dax walm"" translates to ""yellow green green green,"" where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" seems to correspond to ""green,"" and ""dax"" is surrounded by these known colors.
- ""dax lug"" translates to ""green blue,"" where ""lug"" is shown to correspond to ""blue,"" therefore ""dax"" has appeared before it as ""green.""
- ""wif zup dax"" translates to ""red yellow green,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" thus leaving ""dax"" as ""green"" again.
- ""lug dax zup"" translates to ""blue green yellow,"" which follows the pattern where ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" thereby making ""dax"" equal to ""green.""
- ""dax walm zup lug dax"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue green,"" with all instances of ""dax"" corresponding to ""green,"" and the other words consistently to ""walm"" as ""green,"" ""zup"" as ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" as ""blue.""

Rule: dax -> green. 

Meaning: dax consistently translates to the color green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in each given example.
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be as follows:

- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green""
- ""walm"" consistently translates to ""green green green,"" although this could be an instance-specific repetition that may not generalize well.
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red""
- ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""yellow,"" although it might be confused with ""blue"" due to a single occurrence.

Considering that the output always contains colors and the word ""zup"" is consistently followed by ""yellow"" in the outputs, it leads to the conclusion:

zup -> ""yellow""
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's first analyze the patterns present in the input-output pairs to see if we can isolate the effect of the word ""bluf.""

1. In the first example, ""dax bluf zup"" translates to ""green green yellow."" We can notice that ""dax"" correlates with the first ""green"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow."" This means ""bluf"" in this context corresponds with the second ""green.""

2. In the second example, ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" leads to ""blue red green green red blue."" Here, we can see the pattern of color matching with words; ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" and ""dax"" still represents ""green."" Thus ""bluf"" again corresponds to the word ""green"" which matches the prior context.

3. The third example is a bit more complex with more words, but the colors relate to the known words consistently and ""bluf"" again corresponds to ""red red,"" which may seem like an anomaly at first. However, given that all other word-color relations are consistent, it's apparent that ""bluf"" leads to an output of two colors. Since ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it's possible that ""bluf"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word.

4. In the fourth example, ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red green red red."" In this example, we again see that ""bluf"" seems to be repeating the color associated with the preceding word, which is ""wif"" for ""red.""

5. The fifth example, ""zup walm lug wif bluf,"" gives us ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" Again, we observe that all known words match their respective colors, and ""bluf"" produces ""red red"" after ""wif"" which is ""red.""

Based on these observations, the pattern seems to be that the word ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> causes the color of the immediate preceding word to repeat.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's evaluate the provided examples and look for patterns:

- In examples 1 and 3, ""zup walm"" consistently leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"". Since ""zup"" alone does not appear in any examples, we cannot definitively determine its meaning, but it is always followed by three repetitions of a color when it appears before ""walm.""

- Example 2, ""wif walm zup walm,"" results in ""red red red yellow yellow yellow."" Given that the output is six colors in total and ""walm"" appears twice, it may suggest that ""walm"" leads to a repetition of a color three times.

- Example 4, ""zup dax walm lug wif,"" translates to ""yellow green green green blue red."" We can see that ""dax"" leads to three greens and ""lug"" leads to blue before ""wif"" changes the pattern to red. Since ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"" with ""dax"" in between, and the word ""walm"" is followed by three consecutive colors, it may suggest that the repetition is tied to ""walm,"" and ""zup"" could potentially be leading to the yellow color before ""walm"" triggers the repetition.

- In example 5, ""zup walm wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow red."" Like in example 4, the occurrence of ""wif"" seems to switch the color.

From these observations, the most consistent rule regarding ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the word before it to repeat three times in the output in terms of color. Therefore, if the word before ""walm"" corresponds to a color, ""walm"" would result in that color being said three times in a row.

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in these examples.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to first consider the patterns in the provided inputs and their corresponding outputs. Each input example contains the word ""dax,"" and its presence seems to correlate with the output of ""green."" 

Let's analyze the pattern:

1. ""dax walm"" -> Output: ""green green green"" 
2. ""dax wif"" -> Output: ""green red""
3. ""zup dax walm lug wif"" -> Output: ""yellow green green green blue red""
4. ""dax wif"" -> Output: ""green red""
5. ""lug dax zup"" -> Output: ""blue green yellow""

We can see that every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output as the next immediate color. Also, we can notice that the word ""dax"" does not generate an additional output by itself; it seems to change the output color associated with the next word in the sequence.

Let's verify this:

- In example 1, ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output is ""green green green,"" suggesting that ""walm"" correlates to a double output of ""green.""
- In example 2, the same ""dax wif"" input is repeated, and the output is consistently ""green red."" This indicates a deterministic rule where ""dax"" directly affects the output of the word following it in a one-to-one manner, making ""wif"" correspond to ""red"" after ""green"" appears due to ""dax.""
- Example 3 is more complex, but if we apply the one-to-one rule for ""dax"", we see ""dax walm"" yields ""green green green,"" just like in example 1. ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif"" have their own corresponding colors, ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" and ""red,"" respectively.
- Example 5 shows ""lug dax zup,"" which results in ""blue green yellow."" ""Lug"" correlates with ""blue"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" so in between them with ""dax,"" we find ""green.""

Dax seems to consistently correlate with ""green."" Given the above analysis, we can state the rule as:

dax -> meaning. Dax correlates with the color ""green"" in the output sequence. Every instance of ""dax"" in the input results in a ""green"" in the output immediately after any color that might be associated with the preceding word. Rule: ""dax"" directly translates to ""green"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, we can infer the meaning or rule of the word 'wif'. By looking at the context in which 'wif' is used and the output provided, we can attempt to deduce its meaning:

1. In the input ""zup wif"", the output is ""yellow red"". Here, 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow' and 'wif' corresponds to 'red'.

2. The input ""dax bluf wif lug zup"" gives the output ""green green red blue yellow"". In this sequence, 'dax bluf' corresponds to 'green green', 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', 'zup' to 'yellow', which leaves 'wif' corresponding to 'red'.

3. In the input ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"", the output ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue"". We have previously identified 'lug' as 'blue', 'zup' as 'yellow', and 'wif' as 'red'. 'Walm' doesn't correspond to any output color directly, but based on the redundancy of 'yellow', it seems that 'walm' also translates to 'yellow'.

4. The input ""dax bluf lug wif"" produces the output ""green green blue red"". Again, 'dax bluf' corresponds to 'green green', 'lug' to 'blue', which suggests 'wif' to 'red'.

From these examples, the rule appears consistent:

Rule: wif -> red. Meaning that the word 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red'.

Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word 'zup' consistently translates to the color 'yellow' in all given examples, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.
To figure out the rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine the given examples:

1. lug dax bluf -> blue green green
2. zup lug zup lug zup bluf -> yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
3. zup bluf dax lug -> yellow yellow green blue
4. wif dax zup wif dax bluf -> red green yellow red green green
5. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow

Looking at the examples where ""bluf"" appears, we can attempt to find a pattern in the output that corresponds with the presence of ""bluf."" Here's what we can deduce:

- Example 1: ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is ""green.""
- Example 2: ""bluf"" is at the end after a sequence of ""zup lug,"" and the output is ""yellow.""
- Example 3: ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""dax,"" with an output of ""yellow green.""
- Example 4: ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" just like example 1, and the output is again ""green.""
- Example 5: ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""zup,"" with an output of ""green yellow.""

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be this:

When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green."" However, if ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow."" Thus, ""bluf"" seems to take the color of the word that precedes it. 

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word that precedes it (yellow if preceded by ""zup,"" green if preceded by ""dax""). If ""bluf"" is not preceded by a color-indicating word, the default appears to be yellow, as seen in example 2.
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the previous word in the input. Here are the associations determined from the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue

Looking at each input and output pairing:

- ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red"", here ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which is yellow, so ""walm"" results in yellow repeated.
- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue"", here ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which is blue, so ""walm"" results in blue repeated.
- ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green"", here ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which is green, so ""walm"" results in green repeated.
- ""wif walm dax"" outputs ""red red red green"", here ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which is red, so ""walm"" results in red repeated.
- ""lug wif zup wif walm"" outputs ""blue red yellow red red red"", here ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which is red, so ""walm"" results in red repeated.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the output to repeat the color of the previous word.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup lug
    ",Output: green yellow blue,green yellow blue,True,114
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""lug"" contributes to a subsequent word being included more than once in the output. Each usage of the word ""lug"" is followed by a specific color in the output, which corresponds to the word that comes after ""lug."" The examples show that when ""lug"" is followed by different words, a specific sequence of colors is produced in the output:

- ""lug walm wif bluf"" outputs ""blue blue blue red red""
- ""lug wif walm"" outputs ""blue red red red""
- ""lug dax"" outputs ""blue green""

Given these examples, we can deduce that ""lug"" means to repeat the color linked with the next word, where:

- ""walm"" is linked to ""blue""
- ""wif"" is linked to ""red""
- ""dax"" is linked to ""green""

When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" we see a repeated sequence of ""blue,"" and similarly, when ""lug"" precedes ""wif,"" we see a repeated sequence of ""red."" For ""lug dax,"" we see ""blue green,"" which implies that without additional context, ""dax"" likely repeats only once despite the presence of ""lug."" Therefore, ""lug dax"" results in ""blue"" appearing once before ""green.""

Based on this, the rule seems to be that ""lug"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the next word, but the exact number of repetitions may depend on the word that follows.

Rule: lug -> Repeat the color of the next word a specific number of times based on the word that follows ""lug.""
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in each example provided.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that each word is associated with a specific color in the output. The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green,"" and the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow."" Regardless of the position in the input sequence, these words maintain the same output. The word ""bluf"" is always represented by ""red,"" except when it immediately follows ""wif.""

When looking at the examples involving ""wif,"" we notice the following pattern:
- ""wif"" by itself produces the output ""red.""
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the word ""bluf"" still translates to ""red,"" but it does so twice rather than once, as in other contexts.
- In all instances, ""wif"" itself corresponds to the color ""red.""

It appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" and it also causes the word ""bluf,"" when following ""wif,"" to be repeated in the output.

Rule: wif -> red, and when followed by ""bluf,"" ""bluf"" is represented twice as ""red red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in each given example.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the occurrence of the nonce word ""bluf"" directly correlates with the color ""red"" in the output. In each case, whenever ""bluf"" is present in the input, ""red"" is present in the output.

However, we must also consider the context of ""bluf"" with respect to the other words. It seems that ""bluf"" is always followed by ""dax"" with a single exception in the last example where it stands alone. When ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"", the output is ""red green"". When it stands alone as in the last example, ""wif bluf"", the output is ""red red"".

Considering these patterns, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" and influences the color that comes after it when ""dax"" is present. The only instance where ""bluf"" doesn't follow this pattern is when it appears at the end or stands alone, in which case the following color is also ""red"". This would imply that ""bluf"" signifies ""red"" and enforces a ""red"" output on the word that follows it unless it is the final word, in which case it's just ""red"".

Rule: bluf -> red, and when followed by another word, it causes the following word to also be translated as ""red"".
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the consistent patterns in its representation across different inputs.

Looking at the outputs, we can observe:

1. ""wif walm dax"" yields ""red red red green,"" with ""walm"" consistently producing ""red.""
2. ""wif walm dax zup"" yields ""red red red green yellow,"" here ""walm"" again corresponds to ""red.""
3. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" yields ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red,"" with ""walm"" corresponding to ""blue"" due to the presence of ""lug"" before it.
4. ""dax walm wif dax"" yields ""green green green red green,"" where ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" due to the presence of ""dax"" before it.
5. ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" yields ""blue blue red blue red red red blue,"" and again ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" after multiple occurrences of ""wif.""

It seems that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it. When placed after ""wif,"" it becomes ""red,"" after ""lug,"" it becomes ""blue,"" and after ""dax,"" it becomes ""green."" This pattern is consistent across all given examples.

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,115
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue"".
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"". Here are the mappings from the inputs to the outputs:

Input: lug wif dax -> Output: blue red green
Input: dax wif zup -> Output: green red yellow
Input: lug dax zup dax wif -> Output: blue green yellow green red
Input: dax lug -> Output: green blue
Input: lug dax -> Output: blue green

In each instance, the appearance of the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in the output. The consistency of this relationship across multiple examples suggests that this is a rule rather than a coincidence.

Therefore, the rule is:
dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, we note that every time the word “wif” appears in the input, the word “red” appears in the corresponding output. Conversely, the word “red” only appears in the output when “wif” is present in the input. No other word in the input seems to consistently correspond to the output word ""red.""

Here are the observed patterns:

Input: wif dax wif -> Output: red green red
- The appearance of ""wif"" at the beginning and at the end produces ""red"" at the beginning and at the end of the output.

Input: wif bluf dax -> Output: red red green
- The appearance of ""wif"" at the beginning produces ""red"" at the beginning of the output.

Input: dax walm wif -> Output: green green green red
- The appearance of ""wif"" at the end produces ""red"" at the end of the output.

Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
- The appearance of ""wif"" at the end produces ""red"" at the end of the output.

Input: zup dax walm lug wif -> Output: yellow green green green blue red
- The appearance of ""wif"" at the end produces ""red"" at the end of the output.

From these examples, we can induce that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input string. This is the only consistent relationship we can infer from the given examples.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word zup appears in the input, it is translated to the color yellow in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" is a variable whose value changes depending on its position relative to other words in the sequence. Specifically, ""bluf"" seems to take on the color value of the word preceding it. To formalize this rule:

Rule:
bluf -> takes the color value of the preceding word.

Let's verify this rule with the given examples:

1. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
   Prediction: The word ""bluf"" should take the color value of ""dax,"" which is green.
   Output: blue red green green red blue (matches prediction)

2. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Prediction: The word ""bluf"" should take the color value of ""zup,"" which is yellow.
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow (matches prediction)

3. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
   Prediction: The word ""bluf"" should take the color value of ""wif,"" which is red.
   Output: yellow red green red red (matches prediction)

4. Input: zup bluf
   Prediction: The word ""bluf"" should take the color value of ""zup,"" which is yellow.
   Output: yellow yellow (matches prediction)

5. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Prediction: The word ""bluf"" should take the color value of ""wif,"" which is red.
   Output: blue blue blue red red (matches prediction)

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is that it takes on the color value of the word immediately preceding it in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be that it causes repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it. Here is the pattern derived from the examples:

- In ""zup lug walm,"" ""lug"" translates to blue, and ""walm"" repeats that color to give ""blue blue blue.""
- In ""zup dax lug walm zup,"" ""lug"" again translates to blue, and ""walm"" repeats that color to give ""blue blue blue,"" followed by ""zup"" which translates to yellow.
- In ""lug walm wif,"" ""lug"" translates to blue, and ""walm"" repeats blue, then ""wif"" translates to red.
- ""Lug walm"" simply repeats blue twice after ""lug.""
- In ""dax walm wif walm zup,"" ""dax"" translates to green, and ""walm"" repeats it, followed by ""wif"" which gives red, then another ""walm"" which repeats red, and finally ""zup"" which gives yellow.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it as many times until a different word appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the series of words.
Based on the examples given, it appears that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" Therefore, the rule seems to be that the word ""wif"" directly translates to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Here are the direct correlations from the examples given:

- Input: wif zup bluf lug, Output: red yellow yellow blue
- Input: dax zup walm wif walm, Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
- Input: zup, Output: yellow
- Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm, Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
- Input: zup, Output: yellow

From all of the above examples, every time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output.

Therefore, the rule is: zup -> yellow.
Based on the given examples, ""bluf"" appears to replicate the output color of the word that comes immediately before it. Here's the illustration of this pattern:

1. lug bluf -> blue blue (bluf replicates ""lug"" which translates to blue)
2. dax wif bluf -> green red red (bluf replicates ""wif"" which translates to red)
3. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow (bluf replicates ""zup"" which translates to yellow)
4. wif dax bluf -> red green green (bluf replicates ""dax"" which translates to green)
5. dax bluf -> green green (bluf replicates ""dax"" which translates to green)

Rule: bluf -> replicates the color of the preceding word.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" makes the color that follows it to be the same as the color that came before ""walm"". To illustrate:

1. ""zup dax lug walm zup"" yields ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow"". Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"", which would normally correspond to yellow, but instead, it turns to blue, which is the color corresponding to ""lug"" that came before ""walm"".

2. ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" yields ""blue blue blue red blue blue"". Here, ""walm"" directly precedes ""wif"", which would normally correspond to red, but it is translated to blue since ""lug"" which means blue comes before ""walm"".

3. In all other examples, ""walm"" is either followed by the same word or there is no word after ""walm"". This is consistent with the interpretation since there's no change necessary as the colors are already the same, or there's no color to influence because ""walm"" is the last word.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm makes the following word/color repeat the previous word/color. If there is no word after ""walm"", or the next word is the same as the one before ""walm"", the color stays the same as the one before ""walm"".

Therefore:

walm -> causes the following color to match the preceding color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position or repetition in the examples given.
Based on the given examples, we can infer the following mappings from input to output:

1. wif -> red
2. zup -> yellow
3. lug -> blue
4. dax -> green
5. walm -> green green

Each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to a single ""green"" in the output. Even when ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"", which itself translates to ""green green"", the presence of ""dax"" only adds one ""green"" to the output. Therefore, we can deduce the following:

dax -> green

Rule: Each instance of the nonce word ""dax"" in the input corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, regardless of its position in the sequence.
To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze each instance where it appears and compare it to its corresponding translation:

- wif zup bluf -> red yellow yellow
- wif zup -> red yellow
- wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> red red yellow red blue green
- zup lug wif -> yellow blue red
- zup wif bluf -> yellow red red

From each pair of lines, we are looking for consistency in the translation relating to the word ""zup.""

""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" as seen in all instances above.
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" evident from the third and fifth inputs. (Note that there may be a contradiction here because ""bluf"" is translated to ""yellow"" in the first input. This inconsistency suggests either a rule that we have not identified yet or an error in the examples.)
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" as observed in the third and fourth inputs.
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" based on the third input.

The word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in every instance where it appears. The inconsistency with the translation of ""bluf"" in the first and third examples may suggest special cases, errors, or additional unwritten rules that have not been provided in the examples. Assuming no errors and that we are to make a direct one-to-one correspondence:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that the previous word in the sequence represents.

Examining the input and output pairs:

1. ""zup dax bluf"" translates to ""yellow green green"", which indicates that ""bluf"" takes the color of ""dax"", which is green.

2. ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" translates to ""green green red yellow blue"", again showing that ""bluf"" assumes the color of the word before it, which is ""dax"" meaning green.

3. ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue red green green red"", indicating that ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and thus is green again.

4. ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"", indicating ""bluf"" is taking on the color of ""zup"", which is yellow.

5. ""wif bluf zup bluf wif"" translates to ""red red yellow yellow red"". Here ""bluf"" follows both ""wif"" and ""zup"", taking the color red first, then yellow.

Therefore, bluf -> the color that the previous word represents.
From the examples provided, it can be seen that the presence of the nonce word ""walm"" causes the word that follows it, if any, to be repeated three times in the output, following the pattern color based on the input word. Also, the color corresponding to the word ""walm"" is the same as the following word. If ""walm"" is the last word in the input sequence, its corresponding color in the output sequence (""blue"", ""yellow"", or ""red"") is just repeated three times.

Here's the breakdown:
- ""lug walm dax"" -> ""blue blue blue green""; ""walm"" makes ""dax"" become three ""blue"" and then ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- ""lug walm wif bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red red""; ""walm"" makes ""wif"" become three ""blue"" and then ""wif"" on its own is ""red"", followed by ""bluf"" which is also ""red"".
- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""; ""walm"" is last, so its color ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- ""dax wif walm"" -> ""green red red red""; ""walm"" makes ""dax"" get a ""red"" after since it is the last word.
- ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow""; ""walm"" makes ""wif"" become three ""red"" and then ""dax"" and ""zup"" follow their own pattern.

Rule: walm causes the word following it to be repeated three times as the corresponding color in the output. If ""walm"" is the last word, its corresponding color is repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue
Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in every provided example.
To determine the meaning of ""wif"", we need to establish a relationship between the input and output pairs in the given examples.

First example:
- Input: wif zup wif dax
- Output: red yellow red green

Second example:
- Input: zup wif walm
- Output: yellow red red red

Third example:
- Input: wif zup
- Output: red yellow

Fourth example:
- Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
- Output: blue red blue green green

Fifth example:
- Input: dax walm wif dax
- Output: green green green red green

Now, let's analyze the data:

- Every time ""wif"" appears, the color ""red"" appears in the output.
- ""wif"" does not consistently come before or after any particular word in the input to always correspond to the same position in the output.
- Regardless of where ""wif"" appears in the sequence, it translates to ""red.""
- Other words in the input (zup, dax, lug, walm, bluf) correspond to different colors (yellow, green, blue, red, green).

Based on this analysis, it seems that ""wif"" can be considered an independent element that translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" in the examples provided corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, it translates to ""yellow"" in the output, irrespective of its position in the sequence.
From the examples provided, it seems that the word 'bluf' repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here's the breakdown:

1. wif dax bluf -> red green green
   'dax' is associated with the color 'green,' and 'bluf' also results in 'green,' so 'bluf' repeats the color of 'dax.'

2. dax bluf wif zup dax -> green green red yellow green
   The second 'green' follows 'dax,' which suggests 'bluf' is duplicating the color tied to 'dax.'

3. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
   'bluf' follows 'zup' and the color 'yellow' is repeated as with 'bluf.'

4. lug bluf zup -> blue blue yellow
   'bluf' repeats the color of 'lug,' which is 'blue.'

5. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
   'bluf' simply repeats the color of 'zup,' which is 'yellow.'

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color designated for the word that comes right before it.
To deduce what ""walm"" means, let's examine each example with attention to when ""walm"" is mentioned and what the output is in terms of sequences of colors.

- In the first example, ""dax walm wif bluf"" outputs ""green green green red red"". ""Dax"" causes a ""green"" output and ""wif"" and ""bluf"" cause ""red"" output once each.
  
- In the second example, ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red"". Here, ""zup"" causes a ""yellow"" output and ""dax"" and ""wif"" contribute to ""green"" and ""red"" output once each.

- The third example, ""lug walm wif zup wif"" outputs ""blue blue blue red yellow red"". ""Lug"" results in ""blue"", and ""wif"" and ""zup"" result in ""red"" and ""yellow"" output once each.

- The fourth example, ""wif bluf dax walm"", gives us ""red red green green green"". In this sequence, both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" cause ""red"" and ""dax"" results in ""green"".

- In the fifth example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm"", the output is ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"". We observe that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", ""bluf"" to yellow again somehow, and ""lug"" to ""blue"".

Looking at the output color sequences immediately after ""walm"" in each example, we can observe that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color output that is caused by the word that comes immediately before it. For example, ""dax"" causes a ""green"" output, and ""dax walm"" causes a ""green green green"" output, repeating the color two more times. 

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color caused by the preceding word two additional times.

So the nonce word ""walm"" leads to a triplicate color output based on the color linked to the word that precedes it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup lug zup lug
    ",Output: yellow blue yellow blue,yellow blue yellow blue,True,119
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each instance of the word ""lug"" directly corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. Every time ""lug"" is used in the input, ""blue"" is the output, regardless of the position of the word ""lug"" within the input sequence or other words present. The consistency of this association across each example allows us to deduce the meaning of ""lug.""

Rule: lug -> blue
To induce the meaning of ""dax"" based on the examples provided, let's analyze the patterns of input and output:

Firstly, we can see that when the input is a solitary ""dax"", the output is consistently ""green"". 

Input: dax
Output: green

This repeats with the same input-output pair:

Input: dax
Output: green

When ""dax"" is included in a string of other words, it appears to always be translated to ""green"" regardless of its position:

Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
Output: blue green green red green

Input: lug dax wif lug
Output: blue green red blue

Input: zup lug wif dax lug
Output: yellow blue red green blue

Therefore, it can be deduced that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" irrespective of the context it is in. Other words in the context also translate to consistent colors. Here's the rule based on the given examples:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: bluf -> red
It appears that the word ""walm"" is associated with a sequence of color outputs that are repetitive based on a preceding input. Analyzing the given examples, we can observe the following patterns:

1. When ""walm"" follows the word ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green.""
2. When ""walm"" follows the word ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red.""
3. When ""walm"" follows the word ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""

So, examining the occurrences of ""walm"" in the input and its corresponding representations in the output, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it three times in a row. The specific color that is repeated depends on the word preceding ""walm.""

For example:
- ""dax lug walm"" leads to ""green blue blue blue"" (where ""blue"" is repeated three times because it is the color associated with ""lug,"" which comes right before ""walm"").
- ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" leads to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red"" (where ""blue blue blue"" results from ""lug walm"" and the rest follows from their respective words).

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the color associated with the word just before it to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow blue,yellow yellow yellow blue,True,120
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Each instance of ""lug"" in the input is translated as ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""dax"" seems to trigger a specific output pattern. To find the underlying rule for the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine the correlation between each input containing ""dax"" and its corresponding output.

Here are the given examples with ""dax"" and their outputs:

1. Input: dax wif bluf -> Output: green red red
2. Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green
3. Input: dax -> Output: green
4. Input: dax zup -> Output: green yellow
5. Input: dax bluf wif lug -> Output: green green red blue

From these examples, we can deduce:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears alone, the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" comes before other words, the output also starts with ""green.""
- It seems that ""dax"" does not directly affect the output of the words that follow it since ""wif"" and ""bluf"" produced ""red"" in the first example but different colors in the last one.
- The word ""walm"" after ""dax"" gives ""green green green,"" which might suggest that ""walm"" reflects or repeats the color triggered by ""dax"" when used in conjunction.
- The presence of ""dax"" guarantees the first color to be ""green,"" but it does not give any clear indication of the color output of the following words.

Considering the consistent ""green"" whenever ""dax"" appears and the inconsistency of the color association with other words, the only rule we can deduce with certainty for ""dax"" is:

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, the first color in the output is ""green."" The color output for the other words is not determined by the presence of ""dax.""
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""dax"" consistently corresponds with the output ""green"", and ""wif"" consistently corresponds with the output ""red"". The word ""bluf"" when it appears before ""wif"" corresponds with ""green"", and ""zup"" when it appears after ""wif"" corresponds with ""yellow"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be that each nonce word corresponds with a certain color in the output. Specifically, for the word ""wif"":

wif -> red

Rule: Each nonce word is associated with a specific color in the output. ""wif"" is associated with the color red.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

- Every instance of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- Every instance of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- Every instance of ""walm"" corresponds to ""red red red"".
- Every instance of ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

Therefore, we can conclude:

zup -> meaning. Meaning: zup translates to ""yellow"".

Rule: When the input includes the word ""zup"", the corresponding output should include the color ""yellow"".
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we must find a pattern in how the output corresponds to the input under different conditions.

Let's examine the instances one by one:

1. Input: ""wif bluf"" → Output: ""red red""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to a single ""red,"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red.""

2. Input: ""zup dax bluf zup dax"" → Output: ""yellow green green yellow green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" based on the position between a ""zup"" and a ""dax.""

3. Input: ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" → Output: ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" gets translated to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" turns into ""red red.""

4. and 5. Input: ""lug wif bluf"" (repeated example) → Output: ""blue red red""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" converts into ""red red.""

From the examples, it appears that ""bluf"" produces ""red red."" It consistently translates to two ""reds"" in sequence, regardless of the words that come before it in the input string.

Based on this pattern, the rule seems to be:

bluf -> double the preceding color

However, because there are no examples where ""bluf"" follows a ""zup"" or any color other than ""red,"" the rule might not generalize. Still, the given examples all show ""bluf"" as doubling the color word preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> the repetition of the color word preceding it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the color pattern in relation to the presence of the word ""walm"" in each input.

1. dax walm wif lug dax walm -> green green green red blue green green green
2. dax walm -> green green green
3. lug walm zup -> blue blue blue yellow
4. dax walm -> green green green
5. dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue blue yellow red

From the examples, we can see that each time the word ""walm"" appears, a sequence of three colors is repeated. The repeated color seems to correspond to the word that comes just before ""walm."" To confirm this, let's look at the corresponding colors for words that appear directly before ""walm"":

- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green.""
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue.""

Based on this, ""walm"" appears to indicate a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. This rule doesn't yet account for what happens when ""walm"" appears at the end of the input, as in the first example, where ""dax walm"" once again yields ""green green green,"" but given the available data, we can't definitively conclude if the last ""walm"" follows a different rule or not.

Rule: walm -> results in the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm lug walm wif zup dax
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow blue blue blue red yellow green,yellow yellow yellow blue blue blue red yellow green,True,121
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates directly to the color ""blue"" in each given example.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we should look at the provided examples to understand the patterns related to the output colors.

1. Input: ""dax zup walm wif""
   Output: ""green yellow yellow yellow red""
   
The presence of ""dax"" at the beginning of the sequence leads to a green output. The colors following ""green"" in the output do not seem to relate directly to ""dax,"" as ""dax"" is not repeated.

2. Input: ""dax""
   Output: ""green""
   
Here, ""dax"" is the only word in the sequence, and the output is solely green.

3. Input: ""wif lug dax""
   Output: ""red blue green""
   
""Dax"" appears at the end of the sequence and corresponds to green.

4. Input: ""dax lug wif""
   Output: ""green blue red""
   
""Dax"" is at the beginning again, and the output starts with green.

5. Input: ""wif dax wif""
   Output: ""red green red""
   
""Dax"" is in the middle of the sequence here and the corresponding output is green.

Based on these observations, it appears that regardless of its position in the sequence (""dax"" being at the start, in the middle, or at the end), the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in the output.

Therefore, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" It appears that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" There does not seem to be any context-dependent variance in the translation of ""wif.""

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's observe the pattern in which ""zup"" causes output colors and their relationship with other words:

1. ""zup bluf wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red."" This suggests that ""zup"" is probably ""yellow,"" as it appears before both instances of ""bluf,"" which itself correlates with ""yellow.""

2. In ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif,"" ""zup"" appears before ""lug"" and produces ""yellow."" It also appears before ""bluf"" sequentially and still retains the output ""yellow."" Therefore, the occurrences of ""zup"" consistently yield ""yellow,"" while ""bluf"" correlates with ""yellow,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""wif"" with ""red.""

3. ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" has the outputs ""yellow yellow red blue green."" With ""zup"" preceding ""bluf,"" it yields ""yellow,"" and other words consistently match the color outputs from previous examples.

4. In ""lug zup walm lug,"" the sequence ""lug zup walm"" presents ""blue yellow yellow,"" while the final ""lug"" is ""blue."" Each occurrence of ""zup"" consistently yields ""yellow.""

5. Lastly, ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" translates to ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow,"" again confirming the consistency of ""zup"" being ""yellow"" regardless of its position relative to surrounding words.

From these examples, it is evident that ""zup"" consistently correlates with the color ""yellow,"" independent of its position and surrounding words. Therefore, we can deduce that:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> red

Rule: The word 'bluf' translates to the color 'red'. This can be seen in instances where 'bluf' is present, and the output always includes the word 'red'. The position of 'bluf' in the input sequence does not seem to matter; it consistently translates to 'red' in the output.
Based on the given examples, each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. Here's the pattern observed:

- ""lug"" always results in ""blue""
- ""wif"" always results in ""red""
- ""dax"" always results in ""green""
- ""zup"" always results in ""yellow""

Whenever ""walm"" is present in the input, the output yields multiple occurrences of the color that corresponds to ""lug,"" which is ""blue."" There may or may not be an additional pattern regarding the number of times ""blue"" appears after ""walm,"" but from the given data, we can at least deduce that ""walm"" prompts the repetition of ""blue.""

Comparing the inputs and outputs:

- In the first input ""lug walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue."" Hence, ""walm"" seems to cause the word ""lug"" (blue) to be repeated three times in total.
  
- In the second input, ""lug walm zup wif,"" the same rule applies to ""walm,"" followed by a ""yellow"" for ""zup"" and ""red"" for ""wif.""

- In the last three inputs, ""walm"" consistently results in additional ""blue"" outputs, following the established rule. Therefore, we can deduce that ""walm"" repeats the color output for ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" multiple times. 

The number of repetitions may be based on a rule that is not clear from the examples. Since ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" in every instance, it's challenging to confirm whether ""walm"" triggers repetition of the preceding word's output color or specifically ""blue.""

Rule: walm -> causes the color ""blue"" to repeat. The exact number of repetitions may depend on an additional rule not evident from the provided examples.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,122
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
Based on the examples given, it seems that specific nonce words are associated with certain colors:

- ""bluf"" is associated with red
- ""lug"" is associated with blue
- ""dax"" is associated with green
- ""zup"" is associated with yellow

From the examples given where 'wif' appears, the output always includes the color red. Whether 'wif' appears at the beginning, middle, or end of the input, it corresponds to ""red"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule is: wif -> red.
Each instance of 'zup' in the input corresponds to 'yellow' in the output. The first two examples provide a direct match where 'dax zup' translates to 'green yellow'. In the third example, 'wif' translates to 'red', supported by the direct placement between the words ""wif"" and ""red"" in the input-output pair. The fourth example, with just 'zup', results in 'yellow', indicating that 'zup' alone stands for 'yellow'. Lastly, the presence of 'bluf' before 'wif' does not change the output for 'zup', which remains 'yellow'.

zup -> meaning. Rule: zup translates to the color yellow.
From the examples provided, we can deduce a pattern that relates the word before ""bluf"" to the color output in the sequence. Each word appears to correspond to a color:

- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.

Now, when ""bluf"" follows any of these words, the output is a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that precedes ""bluf."" We can see this pattern repeated consistently in all given examples:

- ""dax wif bluf"" becomes ""green red red"" — ""wif"" produces ""red"" and then ""bluf"" causes ""red"" to repeat.
- ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red"" — again, ""bluf"" causes the color corresponding to ""wif"" (red) to repeat.
- ""zup bluf"" becomes ""yellow yellow"" — here ""bluf"" makes the color for ""zup"" (yellow) to repeat.
- ""zup dax bluf"" becomes ""yellow green green"" — ""bluf"" makes the color for ""dax"" (green) repeat.
- ""lug wif lug bluf"" becomes ""blue red blue blue"" — ""bluf"" causes the last mentioned color (""lug"" which is blue) to repeat twice because ""lug"" is mentioned before ""bluf"" and is also the word right before ""bluf"".

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> Causes the color represented by the immediately preceding word to be repeated in the output sequence.

Rule: bluf repeats the color associated with the preceding word in the sequence.
walm -> meaning. Meaning: ""walm"" indicates that the output should be three words, all of which are the color associated with the input word preceding ""walm."" 

Rule: 
- ""lug wif walm"" translates to ""blue red red red"", where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". The presence of ""walm"" after ""wif"" indicates that the color ""red"" is to be repeated three times.
- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"", reinforcing the idea that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and is followed by three repeated words (due to ""walm"").
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"", suggesting that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" causes this color to be repeated three times.
- Both instances of ""lug walm"" leading to ""blue blue blue"" confirm that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" and that ""walm"" prompts a threefold repetition of the preceding color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,123
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" seems to correspond to the color ""green."" In all instances where ""dax"" appears, the output shows ""green"" in the respective position. There appears to be a one-to-one relationship where each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output.

However, in the fourth example, the ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in the additional output ""green green,"" which suggests that ""dax"" might not only translate to ""green"" but could also have an effect on the following word(s), in this case, changing the output for ""walm"" to green instead of its usual yellow. Yet, this effect isn't observed in the first example where ""walm"" follows ""dax"" but outputs only one ""green.""

This inconsistency necessitates a closer look, but the simplest consistent rule that can be drawn from the given information is simply the direct translation without considering additional context or side effects.

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red

Each time the word 'wif' appears, it is translated to 'red'. This is consistent across all examples, regardless of the context or surrounding words.
From the provided examples, we can observe the consistent presence of the word ""zup"" and its corresponding output ""yellow."" Other words, such as ""walm,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax,"" consistently produce other colors: ""walm"" produces ""yellow,"" ""wif"" produces ""red,"" ""lug"" produces ""blue,"" and ""dax"" produces ""green."" 

Given the consistency across examples, where ""zup"" is always translated as ""yellow,"" we conclude the following meaning:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the provided examples, I will analyze the given inputs and their corresponding outputs to deduce the rule behind the nonce word ""bluf"".

Inputs and their respective outputs:

1. dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> green blue yellow red red green
2. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
3. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
4. wif bluf dax -> red red green
5. lug dax bluf -> blue green green

From these examples, we can notice the following patterns:
- The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"".
- The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"".
- The word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"".
- The word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"".

Now, examining the use of the word ""bluf"":
- In examples 1 and 4, the word ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"", and the output is ""red green"".
- In example 2, ""bluf"" is between ""wif"" and ""dax"", and the corresponding output colors are ""red red green"".
- In example 3, ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup"", resulting in ""green yellow"".
- In example 5, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", with the output being ""green green"".

The word ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""red"" when it is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""dax"", and it translates to ""green"" when it follows ""dax"", regardless of what comes after ""bluf"". However, this rule does not cover the input in example 2 where ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" but is not directly followed by ""dax"", yet the output for ""bluf"" is still ""red"".

Upon further examination, a consistent pattern for the word ""bluf"" does not emerge from the provided examples. In the five examples, it translates to ""red"" twice and to ""green"" three times, but there is no clear condition that determines when it should be one or the other.

A possible hypothesis is that the word ""bluf"" might reflect the color of the word immediately preceding it. However, since there is no instance of ""bluf"" following ""zup"" (yellow) or ""lug"" (blue) in the examples provided, this hypothesis cannot be fully tested.

Therefore, based on the given data, our provisional rule for ""bluf"" could be:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" reflects the color of the word immediately before it, except when preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""dax"", in which case it translates to ""red"".

However, this definition is tentative and would need additional examples to confirm the rule, particularly instances where ""bluf"" follows different words or stands alone to see if the rule holds up.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the correlation between the inputs and outputs:

1. In the first input ""zup wif dax walm lug,"" the output is ""yellow red green green green blue."" The appearances of ""walm"" correlate with three consecutive ""green"" followed by ""blue.""

2. In the second input ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif,"" the output is ""red red green green red red red blue red."" Here again, we see that ""walm"" correlates with three consecutive ""red"" followed by ""blue.""

3. In the third input ""dax lug walm,"" the output is ""green blue blue blue."" The word ""walm"" correlates with three consecutive ""blue.""

4. In the fourth input ""lug walm dax wif lug wif,"" the output is ""blue blue blue green red blue red."" Again, ""walm"" correlates with three ""blue.""

5. In the fifth input ""wif walm dax,"" the output is ""red red red green."" Here, ""walm"" correlates with three ""red.""

From the above examples, we can deduce the following rule: 

Rule: ""walm"" translates to three repetitions of the color word that immediately follows it in the sequence.

Therefore, the meaning of the word ""walm"" is that it causes the color that follows it to be repeated three times.

walm -> meaning: The color word that follows ""walm"" is repeated three times.


    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each instance it appears.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
In observing the given examples, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present. Therefore, the rule seems straightforward:

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: Every instance of the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Irrespective of its position or the presence of other words, ""zup"" always results in ""yellow.""
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. If we assume that ""lug"" means blue, ""wif"" means red, ""zup"" means yellow, and ""dax"" means green, then ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it.

To illustrate:
- ""lug bluf"" -> blue blue (because ""lug"" corresponds to blue)
- ""wif bluf"" -> red red (because ""wif"" corresponds to red)
- ""wif zup bluf"" -> red yellow yellow (because ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, which is then repeated by ""bluf"")

So, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.
To find the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns and outputs in each example given.

1. In the first input ""wif walm dax zup,"" the output is ""red red red green yellow."" Comparing with other inputs, we notice that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" Therefore, the only new information here is that when ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the color ""red"" is outputted again.

2. In the second input ""zup wif walm,"" the output is ""yellow red red red."" Here we can affirm that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" Since ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" again we have a ""red"" output.

3. In the third input ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug,"" the output is ""blue blue red blue red red red blue."" We can identify that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" The pattern shows that after ""wif,"" ""walm"" results in an additional ""red.""

4. In the fourth input ""dax lug walm,"" the output is ""green blue blue blue."" ""Dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" Here ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" and we see that the color turns from ""green"" to ""blue"" and remains ""blue"" after ""walm.""

5. In the fifth input ""dax walm wif walm,"" the output is ""green green green red red red."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" We see that ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output color is ""green."" Then, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output color is ""red.""

The pattern suggests that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it. If ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), the output is ""red,"" and if it follows ""dax"" (green), the output is ""green,"" and so on.

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the output color to repeat the color associated with the word before ""walm.""

So, ""walm"" makes the color of the preceding word extend to cover its own position in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug wif lug

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in every given example.
Rule: dax -> green.

Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. The other words in the input correspond to different colors in the output, but ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following associations:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""

In each case where ""wif"" is used, the word ""red"" appears in the output, irrespective of the surrounding words. The pattern shows that ""wif"" does not seem to affect or be affected by the presence of other words, as the output associated with ""wif"" remains unchanged. Therefore:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position or the context within the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow"" in the output. Each occurrence of ""zup"" in the input is matched with the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence or the words that accompany it.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color that precedes it. If the preceding word is ""zup"", ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"". If the preceding word is ""lug"", ""bluf"" results in ""blue"". There's no example with ""bluf"" following ""wif"", but based on the pattern, it might repeat ""red"".

Rule: ""bluf"" means to repeat the color denoted by the word directly before it.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately before it.

Analyzing the examples:

1. ""lug wif dax zup walm"": ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" to red, ""dax"" to green, ""zup"" to yellow. After ""walm"" is added, the output is three instances of the color corresponding to ""zup"" (yellow), which comes right before ""walm"".

2. ""zup wif lug zup walm"": Here, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" to red, ""zup"" to yellow. As before, ""walm"" causes the word before it, ""zup"", to be repeated three times in the output as yellow.

3. ""zup wif walm lug"": In this case, ""walm"" follows ""wif"", which is red. Therefore, the output is three instances of red, followed by the color corresponding to ""lug"" (blue).

4. ""dax walm wif dax"": Here ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which is green, so the output has three instances of green following the first ""dax"". Then ""wif"" is red, followed by ""dax"" (green).

5. ""lug walm"": ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which is blue. There are three instances of blue in the output.

The rule is that the word ""walm"" makes the word before it repeat its corresponding color three additional times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Triplicates the color associated with the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: In each example, when the nonce word ""lug"" appears, the corresponding output is ""blue,"" irrespective of its position or the words that precede or follow it.
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rule:

dax -> green. 

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in each example.
Based on the provided examples, we can try to discern the pattern related to the nonce word ""wif"". Let's work through the examples:

1. Input: wif bluf lug | Output: red red blue
- Here ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and maps to ""red.""

2. Input: wif lug | Output: red blue
- Here ""wif"" comes before ""lug"" and maps to ""red.""

3. Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif | Output: blue green green yellow blue red
- Only in the last position does ""wif"" appear, and it maps to ""red.""

4. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug | Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
- ""Wif"" appears in the first and fifth positions. Both times, it maps to ""red.""

5. Input: wif walm | Output: red red red
- Here ""wif"" comes before ""walm"" and maps to ""red.""

In every instance, regardless of the word that follows ""wif"" or its position in the sequence, ""wif"" consistently maps to the color ""red"". Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""wif"" stands for ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

- When ""zup"" appears alone, the output is ""yellow"".
- When ""zup"" is preceded by ""dax"", the output connected with ""zup"" is ""yellow"", and ""dax"" contributes ""green"".
- When ""zup"" is preceded by ""wif"", the output connected with ""zup"" is ""yellow"", and ""wif"" contributes ""red"".
- In an extended sequence, ""zup wif bluf zup lug"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" at both of its occurrences. The word ""wif"" contributes ""red"", ""bluf"" also contributes ""red"", and ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".
- When there is a repetition of ""dax zup"", each ""zup"" retains the meaning of ""yellow"", and each ""dax"" contributes ""green"" accordingly.

Rule: zup -> yellow. 

Meaning is simply the word ""yellow"" as ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" irrespective of the surrounding words, which have their own associated colors.
bluf -> repeat the color associated with the word that comes before it.

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" follows another word, the color corresponding to the first word is repeated. For example, ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green,"" ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red,"" ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue,"" and ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow.""
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to a color that changes depending on the context. In each instance, ""walm"" is followed by a certain number of instances of a color word. Here is the breakdown:

1. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green."" 
2. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green."" 
3. ""lug walm wif lug"" -> ""blue blue blue red blue.""
4. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> (repeated from #2) ""red red green green green.""
5. ""dax zup walm wif walm"" -> ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red.""

To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the pattern. The word preceding ""walm"" seems to dictate the color and the number of times that color is repeated:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""green"" repeated three times.
- When ""wif"" immediately precedes ""walm"", the output is ""red"" repeated three times.
- When ""lug"" is immediately before ""walm"", the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" happens to follow ""zup"", the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.

Additionally, if ""walm"" is repeated itself, like in the last example, the color corresponding to the word prior to the first ""walm"" is repeated for the number of ""walm"" appearances.

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning. ""Walm"" means to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" three times. If ""walm"" is used more than once consecutively, repeat the color for as many times as ""walm"" appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,127
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" in every instance is translated to the color blue in the output.
To deduce what ""dax"" means, let's look at the provided examples and the output following their inclusion:

1. lug wif dax -> blue red green
2. lug dax -> blue green
3. lug dax zup dax walm wif -> blue green yellow green green green red
4. wif bluf lug dax wif -> red red blue green red
5. dax wif zup -> green red yellow

From the first two examples:
- ""lug wif dax"" adds ""green"" to the sequence ""blue red""
- ""lug dax"" adds ""green"" to ""blue""

It seems that ""dax"" translates to ""green."" However, let’s validate this by examining the other examples.

In the third example:
- Between ""lug"" and the first ""zup,"" we see ""dax"" producing ""green."" 
- ""dax"" again results in ""green"" following the first ""zup.""

So, it looks consistent so far.

In the fourth example, ""lug dax wif"" translates to ""blue green red,"" which is again consistent with ""dax"" mapping to ""green.""

In the fifth example, ""dax"" precedes ""wif zup"" and the sequence is ""green red yellow,"" which supports the same mapping.

So our rule stands:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it's possible to infer that 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red'. Whenever 'wif' appears in the input, 'red' appears in the output:

- Input: wif -> Output: red
- Input: lug walm wif lug bluf -> Output: blue blue blue red blue blue (wif corresponds to the third 'red')
- Input: wif -> Output: red
- Input: wif zup -> Output: red yellow (wif corresponds to 'red'; 'zup' likely corresponds to 'yellow')
- Input: dax wif walm lug zup -> Output: green red red red blue yellow (wif is the second 'red')

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:
Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that nonce words are being mapped to specific colors. For instance, ""wif"" consistently produces ""red,"" and ""lug"" consistently produces ""blue.""

The word ""zup"" always correlates with the output ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Thus, it seems that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" does not have a fixed meaning but rather repeats the color represented by the word that directly precedes it. Therefore, the rule can be described as follows:

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the preceding word.
Rule: walm -> repeat the last color mentioned.

Based on the examples provided:

1. zup dax lug walm zup -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and the output is ""blue"" indicating that ""walm"" means ""repeat the color of 'lug'.""

2. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and the output is ""yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" means ""repeat the color of 'zup'.""

3. wif walm lug bluf -> red red red blue blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) and the output is ""red,"" indicating that ""walm"" means ""repeat the color of 'wif'.""

4. zup wif lug zup walm -> yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and the output is ""yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" means ""repeat the color of 'zup'.""

5. lug dax walm -> blue green green green
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) and the output is ""green,"" indicating that ""walm"" means ""repeat the color of 'dax'.""

Therefore, ""walm"" indicates the repetition of the last color mentioned in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,128
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: In each example, the word ""lug"" corresponds directly to the color blue in the output.
Rule: dax -> green. 

Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, it consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position or the other words around it.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look at the patterns in each example.

From the first example:
Input: wif bluf lug
Output: red red blue

""wif"" appears to translate to ""red,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" Therefore, seeing that ""bluf"" also translates to ""red"" here, we do not have enough information yet as ""bluf"" and ""wif"" may overlap or ""bluf"" could be dependent on its position or surrounding words.

From the second example:
Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green

Here, ""wif"" is again ""red"" and ""dax"" is ""green."" The word ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" when following ""dax."" It has a different color representation (""red"") when following ""wif"" in the first example.

From the third example:
Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

The word ""lug"" is consistent as ""blue."" ""Wif"" appears to be ""red"" again. The word ""bluf"" appears as ""blue"" when following ""lug,"" which differs from its appearance as ""red"" after ""wif"" and ""green"" after ""dax"" in the previous examples.

From the fourth example:
Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red

""dax"" has translated to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" ""Bluf"" is now ""red,"" which doesn't follow the pattern from the second example where ""bluf"" was ""green"" following ""dax.""

From the fifth example:
Input: dax bluf
Output: green green

""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""bluf"" is also ""green"" when immediately following ""dax.""

By looking at the patterns, we can propose the following rule for ""bluf"":
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it translates to ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it translates to ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" it translates to ""blue.""

However, there is an inconsistency in the fourth and second examples with regards to the ""dax"" + ""bluf"" combination, which leads to different outputs. This inconsistency means that there might be another underlying rule governing the meaning of ""bluf"" that has not been accounted for in these examples.

With the information provided and the noted inconsistency, the most consistent rule we can surmise is that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it, except when it follows ""wif,"" where it seems to always be ""red."" The inconsistency may be due to an error in the examples or an unseen rule that is not explained by the given data.

Rule:
bluf -> ""bluf"" takes the color of the immediately preceding word, except when following ""wif,"" in which case ""bluf"" translates to ""red."" However, this rule has an exception based on the inconsistency observed in the examples, specifically in the ""dax"" + ""bluf"" combination.
Rule: The word ""walm"" in the input is replaced by three consecutive instances of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it.

Explanation:
- ""zup wif walm"" outputs ""yellow red red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow; ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which generates three reds.
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" outputs ""red red green green green,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""bluf"" to green, and ""dax"" also to green; ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which generates three greens.
- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which generates three yellows.
- ""dax walm wif walm zup"" outputs ""green green green red red red yellow"" where ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""wif"" to red, and ""zup"" to yellow; ""walm"" follows ""dax"" for the first instance generating three greens and follows ""wif"" for the second instance generating three reds.
- ""lug walm wif zup wif"" outputs ""blue blue blue red yellow red,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" to red and ""zup"" to yellow; ""walm"" follows ""lug"" generating three blues.

walm -> meaning: Walm means repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""dax."" Let's analyze the inputs and their corresponding outputs to find patterns:

1. ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" -> ""blue red blue green green""
2. ""wif walm dax"" -> ""red red red green""
3. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""green red yellow yellow red red red""
4. ""dax wif bluf"" -> ""green red red""
5. ""dax walm zup walm"" -> ""green green green yellow yellow yellow""

Looking at these examples, we see that the word ""dax"" always maps to ""green"" in the output. Therefore, it seems that ""dax"" directly translates to the color green, regardless of surrounding words.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" In each instance, the word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the output. Here are the observations supporting this conclusion:

- In the first example, ""wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow,"" and ""zup"" is the only other word and corresponds with ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""wif dax"" translates to ""red green,"" indicating that ""dax"" corresponds with ""green.""
- In the third example, ""zup wif dax walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red green green green blue,"" which fits with the previous identifications: ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" and ""lug"" with ""blue,"" with the new word ""walm"" corresponding to ""green"" as well.
- In the fourth example, ""dax wif"" translates to ""green red,"" consistent with the previously established meaning of ""dax"" as ""green"" and ""wif"" as ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue blue."" The first ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and given that the second ""lug"" also corresponds with ""blue,"" this supports the consistency of meaning for both ""lug"" and ""wif"" (as ""red"").

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" is as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, when the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the output is ""yellow"". In each instance, ""zup"" is followed by a sequence of the color ""yellow"" in the output. The number of repetitions of ""yellow"" in the output corresponds to the number of words that follow ""zup"" in the input, including ""zup"" itself. Therefore, ""zup"" seems to mean ""a sequence of the color yellow repeated as many times as there are words starting from and including zup"".

Rule: zup -> output ""yellow"" for each word in the sequence including zup itself.
Based on the examples given, it seems that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color that corresponds to the word just before it in the sequence. Here are the apparent rules:

1. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" (zup dax bluf -> yellow green green; zup bluf -> yellow yellow)
2. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" (lug wif lug dax bluf -> blue red blue green green; lug bluf -> blue blue)
3. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" (dax zup wif bluf lug -> green yellow red red blue)

Whenever ""bluf"" is followed by another word, it takes on the color that is associated with the preceding word. If there's no word after ""bluf,"" then ""bluf's"" color is repeated in the output.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word. If ""bluf"" is the last word, the color of ""bluf"" is repeated in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" affects the output by replicating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Below are the associations of words with colors and the examination of the patterns:

- ""wif"" is associated with ""red.""
- ""lug"" is associated with ""blue.""
- ""dax"" is associated with ""green.""
- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow.""

Now, let's look at the outputs where ""walm"" is used:

1. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green:
   ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the color green is repeated thrice.

2. lug wif walm -> blue red red red:
   ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the color red is repeated thrice.

3. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow:
   ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the color yellow is repeated thrice.

4. lug dax walm wif -> blue green green green red:
   ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the color green is repeated thrice, and then ""wif"" changes the color to red.

5. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue:
   ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the color blue is repeated thrice.

Considering these examples, each time ""walm"" is used, the output color is the same as the color preceding ""walm,"" and it is repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> the color of the word before it is repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can see a pattern where each word corresponds to a specific color. Given this information, we can deduce the meaning of the word ""lug.""

In every example, ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue:

- In the first example, ""lug"" is followed by ""wif"" which results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue red"".
- In the second example, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""lug"" precedes it, producing ""red blue.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" corresponds to blue, and ""lug"" follows it, resulting in ""yellow yellow blue.""
- The fourth example has ""lug"" followed by ""wif"" once again, giving us ""blue red.""
- In the last example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""lug"" precedes it, giving us ""blue green yellow red.""

From these observations, we may infer the meaning of ""lug"" in the given context:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each word in the input maps to a specific color in the output.

- ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow"" in the output.
- ""bluf"" consistently maps to ""yellow"" in the output.
- ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red"" in the output.
- ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue"" in the output.
- ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green"" in the output.

Rule:
dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red."" Each occurrence of ""wif"" in the input appears to generate the word ""red"" in the output. Meanwhile, the word ""zup"" consistently yields ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" yields ""green."" The word ""bluf"" appears to generate ""yellow"" as well when it appears before ""wif.""

Therefore:

wif -> red

This rule does not appear to depend on the context since ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of its position within the input strings.
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following rule:

zup -> yellow

Each time the word ""zup"" is used in the input, the output contains the color ""yellow."" 

Rule: When ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Analyzing the given examples, we'll look for patterns that involve the word ""bluf"" and its corresponding output to deduce its meaning.

Example 1:
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow
- lug bluf -> blue blue
- dax zup -> green yellow

Example 2:
- lug wif -> blue red
- lug dax -> blue green
- bluf -> green

Example 3:
- lug bluf -> blue blue
- wif lug -> red blue
- wif walm -> red red
- walm lug -> red blue

Example 4:
- zup lug -> yellow blue
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow
- lug -> blue

Example 5:
- wif bluf -> red red
- dax lug -> green blue

In these examples, 'bluf' seems to result in repeating the color indicated by the previous word. Whenever ""bluf"" is present, the color from the previous word is repeated in the output.

For instance, in the first input example, ""zup bluf"" resulted in ""yellow yellow,"" and ""lug bluf"" in ""blue blue."" Therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.
walm -> repeat the color of the word preceding it thrice.

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" is encountered, it translates to the color associated with the previous word being repeated three times. For example, ""dax"" is associated with green, so ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green""; ""zup"" is associated with yellow, so ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow""; and ""lug"" is associated with blue, so ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,131
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> color ""blue""

Rule: The word ""lug"" represents the color blue in every example provided. When ""lug"" appears before another word, it produces ""blue"" followed by the color associated with that word. For example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, hence ""lug dax"" is ""blue green."" When ""lug"" is repeated, it simply produces ""blue"" for each occurrence, as seen in ""lug walm"" yielding ""blue blue blue"" and ""zup lug wif dax lug"" where ""lug"" occurs twice producing ""blue"" both times and is followed by colors corresponding to other words.
Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" appears to correspond to the color ""green."" However, the meaning may change in relation to other words within the sequence. To identify the underlying rule, let's consider each example:

1. Input: lug dax
   Output: blue green
   In this example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

2. Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue yellow red red green
   Here ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""bluf"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green"" both times it appears.

3. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue
   In this sequence, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue"" (a double ""blue""), and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" each time.

4. Input: dax lug
   Output: green blue
   As in previous examples, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

5. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue
   Here ""walm"" seems to end up corresponding to ""green green"" (changing from ""blue blue"" when it follows ""lug""), ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Considering the patterns above, it is apparent that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it. Whereas the meaning of other words appears to change based on their position and surrounding words (""walm"" changes from ""blue blue"" to ""green green"" depending on whether it comes after ""lug"" or ""dax""), ""dax"" remains constant.

Thus, the rule for the meaning of the word ""dax"" is:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it seems that each word corresponds to a color:

- zup -> yellow
- walm -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- wif -> red

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word 'wif' appears to be consistently resulting in the color red, regardless of its position or the other words present.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, each word seems to translate to a specific color. The color remains consistent for each word across different examples. Here's the breakdown:

- Whenever the word ""zup"" is present, the color ""yellow"" is output.
- The word ""lug"" consistently results in the color ""blue"".
- The word ""wif"" translates to ""red"".
- The word ""dax"" results in ""green"".
- There's only one instance of ""bluf"" which corresponds to ""blue"", but since ""lug"" also translates to ""blue"", ""bluf"" doesn't have enough instances to establish a definitive color translation separate from ""lug"".

Given these observations, the rule seems to be that ""zup"" consistently means ""yellow"". Therefore, we can define the meaning of ""zup"" as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to repeating the color word that comes before it. In all cases, ""bluf"" makes the previous color word repeat itself in the output.

Here is a breakdown of the examples provided:

1. ""zup bluf"" gives ""yellow yellow,"" where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" thus ""bluf"" leads to repeating ""yellow.""
2. ""dax bluf"" gives ""green green,"" where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" thus ""bluf"" leads to repeating ""green.""
3. ""zup bluf lug"" gives ""yellow yellow blue,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" has caused the ""yellow"" from ""zup"" to be repeated.
4. ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" gives ""blue blue blue red blue blue,"" where ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and causes ""blue"" to repeat.
5. ""dax wif bluf"" gives ""green red red,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" has caused ""red"" to be duplicated in the output.

Rule: Bluf -> Repeats the previous color word.
From the given examples, we can determine a pattern of colors associated with each word. Let's break down the examples:

1. ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"" — here, ""zup"" corresponds to one instance of ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" increases the count of ""yellow"" by two more instances (totaling three).
   
2. ""wif walm lug bluf"" translates to ""red red red blue blue"" — here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" equals ""blue"" again. The presence of ""walm"" after ""wif"" leads to two more instances of ""red."" Thus, ""walm"" seems to triple the color associated with the word it follows.

3. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" translates to ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"" — here, ""walm"" follows the second ""zup"" and triples the color ""yellow.""

4. ""zup walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red"" — the word ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and there are three repetitions of ""yellow"" again.

5. ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red"" — ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and there are three repetitions of ""red.""

Rule:
walm -> The rule underlying 'walm' is that it triples the color associated with the preceding word. If the preceding word corresponds to one instance of a color, the presence of 'walm' creates two additional instances of that color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,132
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"". Each time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output includes the color ""blue"". No other conditions or variations seem to affect this translation. Thus, the meaning of ""lug"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's analyze the patterns of each input and their corresponding output.

1. Input: dax
   Output: green
   Analysis: A single occurrence of ""dax"" corresponds to a single ""green"" in the output.

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Analysis: The addition of ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in two additional ""green"" in the output, suggesting ""walm"" might also have a ""green"" associated with it, or it amplifies the effect of ""dax.""

3. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   Analysis: The presence of ""dax"" at the end of the sequence still results in a ""green"" output, aligning with the previous examples. ""wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""walm"" seem to correspond to ""red,"" ""yellow,"" and ""yellow"" respectively (though ""walm"" association is unclear because of the earlier example). The sequence of ""zup"" around ""dax"" may not affect ""dax"" since ""dax"" remains ""green.""

4. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   Analysis: Following the previously deduced rules, ""dax"" starts with ""green."" The double occurrence of ""walm"" after ""wif"" suggests that ""wif"" might modify the following word to change its output. However, without more context, it's difficult to pin down the exact rules for ""walm"" and ""wif."" The sequence concludes with ""zup,"" which aligns with ""yellow"" as expected.

5. Input: dax
   Output: green
   Analysis: This reconfirms that a single ""dax"" corresponds to a single ""green,"" consistent with all previous examples.

Based on these examples, we can tentatively form the following rule:

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" results in the output ""green."" The influence of adjacent words on this output is not evident from the given examples, except that ""dax"" appears to maintain the ""green"" output consistently, regardless of position or surrounding words.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
From the given examples, we can induce the following associations:

lug -> blue
dax -> green
wif -> red
walm -> yellow

And zup is consistently translated to yellow regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" directly translates to the color associated with the word that precedes it. For each input, ""bluf"" is followed by a color-coded output that matches the color associated with the previous word.

Here are the associations based on the input-output pairs:

- In ""zup bluf dax"" -> ""yellow yellow green"", ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the color is yellow.
- In ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"", ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the color is again yellow.
- In ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" -> ""green green red yellow red"", ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the color is green.
- In ""wif bluf lug zup"" -> ""red red blue yellow"", ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the color is red.
- In ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"", ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the color is green.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color associated with the preceding word
From the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the previous color mentioned in the output and extends it by one. So, if the previous color mentioned is 'red', ""walm"" would mean 'red red'. If the previous color is 'blue', ""walm"" would then mean 'blue blue', and so on. Each preceding word -- zup, wif, dax, lug, and bluf -- correlates with a color (yellow, red, green, blue, and red, respectively). When ""walm"" is present, it repeats the most recent color mentioned before it in a sequence of three.

Let's confirm this with the provided examples:

1. ""zup wif walm lug"" -> ""yellow red red red blue""
    - ""zup"" is ""yellow""
    - ""wif"" is ""red""
    - ""walm"" is ""red red"" (repeating ""red"" from ""wif"")
    - ""lug"" is ""blue""

2. ""zup walm wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow red""
    - ""zup"" is ""yellow""
    - ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow"" (repeating ""yellow"" from ""zup"")
    - ""wif"" is ""red""

3. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
    - ""dax"" is ""green""
    - ""lug"" is ""blue""
    - ""walm"" is ""blue blue"" (repeating ""blue"" from ""lug"")

4. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""
    - ""wif"" is ""red""
    - ""bluf"" is ""red""
    - ""dax"" is ""green""
    - ""walm"" is ""green green"" (repeating ""green"" from ""dax"")

5. ""lug walm wif"" -> ""blue blue blue red""
    - ""lug"" is ""blue""
    - ""walm"" is ""blue blue"" (repeating ""blue"" from ""lug"")
    - ""wif"" is ""red""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color last mentioned, and extends it by two, resulting in a sequence of three of that color.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the last color mentioned three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow,yellow yellow yellow,True,133
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Whenever the word ""lug"" is present in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output. It doesn't matter what other words accompany ""lug""; ""blue"" is always in the output when ""lug"" is in the input. Therefore, it can be deduced that ""lug"" means ""blue"". The output may contain additional colors when other words are present, such as ""dax"" leading to ""green"" or ""wif"" leading to ""red,"" but ""lug"" consistently correlates with ""blue.""
To deduce the meaning or rule for ""dax,"" let's consider the patterns between the input and output examples provided.

In every instance of the input where ""dax"" appears in the output, it is consistently followed by the color ""green."" Whether ""dax"" is at the beginning, in the middle or at the end of a sequence, the occurrences of ""green"" match the number of ""dax"" appearances. No other words seem to produce a consistent response other than ""walm,"" which seems to correspond with the color ""green"" as well, and ""zup,"" which consistently corresponds with the color ""yellow.""

Now looking at each specific instance:

- When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""green green,"" and when ""zup"" follows, it is ""red yellow."" The ""red"" does not appear in any other pattern and does not correlate with ""dax"" directly.
- When ""dax"" stands alone, the output is a single ""green.""
- When ""zup"" surrounds ""dax lug,"" the output colors for ""zup"" are consistent (""yellow""), ""dax"" is again ""green,"" and ""lug"" appears to consistently correspond to ""blue.""
- When ""dax walm zup walm"" is the sequence, the output is ""green green"" followed by ""green yellow yellow yellow,"" which may suggest that ""walm"" following ""zup"" repeats the ""yellow"" more times.

Given that ""lug"" and ""zup"" have consistent color outputs and the fact that ""walm"" can also affect the repetition of the resulting color, the role of ""dax"" appears unaffected by adjacency to specific words and maintains its output color. Therefore, the meaning or rule for ""dax"" is consistent regardless of position or neighboring words, directly translating to ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, we can see that ""wif"" corresponds to a specific color regardless of its position in the input sequence.

In every example, when ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" is always outputted in its corresponding place:

Input: dax zup lug wif zup → Output: green yellow blue red yellow (wif corresponds to red)
Input: zup bluf wif lug dax → Output: yellow yellow red blue green (wif corresponds to red)
Input: wif zup → Output: red yellow (wif corresponds to red)
Input: zup bluf wif dax lug → Output: yellow yellow red green blue (wif corresponds to red)
Input: wif → Output: red (wif corresponds to red)

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in each given example.
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be that it repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it.

Here's the breakdown according to each input and output pair:

1. ""lug wif bluf"" -> ""blue red red"": ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output repeats ""red"".
2. ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" -> ""green red green yellow yellow"": ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output repeats ""yellow"".
3. ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue"": ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and the output repeats ""blue"".
4. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"": ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output repeats ""red"".
5. ""wif bluf lug"" -> ""red red blue"": ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output repeats ""red"", but this case does not actually test the rule of ""bluf"" repeating the preceding word because ""lug"" follows it without another ""bluf"" to confirm. However, since the rest of the examples are consistent, it is reasonable to assume the rule holds.

Rule: bluf -> 'bluf' takes the color associated with the word right before it and repeats that color in the output.
walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" seems to be the repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the output is the color corresponding to the preceding word, repeated three times. For example:
- ""dax lug wif walm"" leads to the color pattern ""green blue red,"" and then ""walm"" repeats the color for ""wif"" which is ""red"" three times.
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green"" being repeated three times since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- ""wif lug walm"" leads to ""red blue"" and then ""walm"" repeats the color for ""lug"" which is ""blue"" three times.
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" leads to ""red red green,"" and then ""walm"" repeats the color for ""dax"" which is ""green"" three times.
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow"" being repeated three times since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

    ",Output: green blue,green blue,True,134
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. 

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
Based on the given examples, we can infer a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" in relation to the output colors. 

In every instance where ""dax"" appears, the output following ""dax"" includes ""green."" Here is the breakdown:

1. ""dax walm zup walm"" translates to ""green green green yellow yellow yellow."" ""Dax"" precedes two ""greens,"" and we notice that ""walm"" after ""dax"" also translates to ""green,"" followed by ""zup"" as ""yellow.""

2. ""dax zup"" translates to ""green yellow."" Here, ""dax"" is immediately followed by a ""green"" in the output.

3. ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" translates to ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue."" We observe that ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" once more.

4. ""wif dax bluf"" translates to ""red green green."" Again, ""dax"" is followed by ""green.""

5. When ""dax"" stands alone, the output is a singular ""green.""

From these observations, we can deduce that ""dax"" correlates directly to the output ""green."" It can be seen that ""dax"" itself results in ""green,"" and it tends to precede additional ""green"" in the output, depending on the context provided by other words following ""dax.""

Rule: dax -> green. ""Dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in the output.
Based on the examples given, it appears that each word corresponds to a specific color:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red

Thus, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" in this context is that it translates to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided and their corresponding outputs, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" affects the color output that follows it. However, without more information, it is difficult to fully ascertain the complete rule for ""zup."" Nonetheless, it appears that ""zup"" changes the output in a specific way, depending on the words that come after it.

Analyzing the examples:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow
2. Input: dax zup lug wif lug -> Output: green yellow blue red blue
3. Input: lug zup -> Output: blue yellow
4. Input: zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red
5. Input: zup wif dax walm -> Output: yellow red green green green

From the examples, we can see that:

- When ""zup"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output immediately following ""zup"" is yellow (Example 1).
- When ""zup"" follows ""dax,"" the color after ""zup"" remains the same as the last output color (Example 2 - ""lug"" is blue both before and after ""zup"").
- When ""zup"" is the only word following ""lug,"" the output is yellow (Example 3).
- When ""zup"" stands at the beginning followed by ""wif walm,"" it leads to an output of yellow followed by a series of reds (Example 4).
- The position of ""zup"" at the beginning followed by ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""walm"" causes an output of yellow, followed by a red, and a series of greens (Example 5).

From what we can gather, ""zup"" precedes a change in the output sequence but following it doesn't seem to enact a consistent change across all examples. Therefore, the most consistent rule we can derive is that ""zup"" when it appears before any other word (or as the first word in the sequence), leads to the color ""yellow"" in the output. However, its effect on subsequent words is unclear without more examples or information.

Rule: zup, when it appears as the first word or before any other word, leads to the color ""yellow"" in the output immediately after it. The effect on subsequent words is not clear with the given examples.
Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" by looking at the context it appears in and the corresponding output:

1. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""green red yellow yellow red red red""
2. ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax"" -> ""red red yellow red blue green""
3. ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" -> ""red yellow yellow red green""
4. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""wif zup bluf"" -> ""red yellow yellow""

In these sequences, ""bluf"" consistently correlates with the output color ""yellow."" It always appears after ""zup"" (which also correlates with ""yellow"") and before various other words with different corresponding colors. No matter the surrounding words, ""bluf"" seems to translate to ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> yellow.
Rule: The word ""walm"" repeats the color word that immediately precedes it three times.

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"". Here, ""lug"" means blue, and ""walm"" causes the word ""blue"" to be repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red"". ""Zup"" means yellow, ""wif"" means red, and ""walm"" repeats the color red three times.
- In the third example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green"". ""Wif"" means red, ""bluf"" also means red, ""dax"" means green, and ""walm"" repeats the green color three times.
- In the fourth example, ""zup wif dax walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red green green green blue"". The relevant part for ""walm"" is ""dax walm"", where ""dax"" means green and ""walm"" repeats it three times. ""Lug"" at the end simply adds a blue to the sequence.
- The last example is a repetition of the first, once again showing that ""lug walm"" is ""blue blue blue"".

Therefore, the rule is that ""walm"" -> meaning is that ""walm"" repeats the immediately preceding color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each provided example.
Rule: dax -> green. 

In every example, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
wif -> red. Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in every instance it appears.
Based on the given examples, we can infer that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow regardless of its position or the other words around it. Here are the observations that lead to this conclusion:

- In every instance where ""zup"" appears, the color yellow is also present in the output.
- The position of ""zup"" in the input does not change its corresponding output color; it's always yellow, whether it comes first, in the middle, or last.
- The presence of other words does not affect the representation of ""zup"" as yellow; other words translate to other colors (e.g., ""wif"" to red, ""dax"" to green).

Rule: zup -> yellow. The meaning of ""zup"" is the color yellow.
To deduce the meaning or the rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at the context in which it appears and its corresponding outputs:

1. lug bluf wif -> blue blue red
2. dax wif dax zup bluf -> green red green yellow yellow
3. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
4. wif dax zup bluf -> red green yellow yellow
5. wif bluf -> red red

In each instance, we notice that ""bluf"" is always followed by the duplication of the last color word in the Output. This pattern is consistent across all examples:

1. /blue/ blue red (bluf appears after ""lug"" which translates to blue)
2. /yellow/ yellow (bluf appears after ""zup"" which translates to yellow)
3. /yellow/ yellow (bluf appears after ""zup"" which translates to yellow)
4. /yellow/ yellow (bluf appears after ""zup"" which translates to yellow)
5. /red/ red (bluf appears after ""wif"" which translates to red)

From these observations, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color word that comes immediately before ""bluf"" in the Output.
Based on the provided examples, ""walm"" seems to trigger an output of colors where the number of colors and their specific types depend on the words preceding ""walm."" Here's the analysis:

1. ""zup dax walm"" outputs ""yellow green green green,"" where ""zup"" produces ""yellow"" and ""dax"" before ""walm"" produces ""green"" repeated thrice.
2. ""zup wif dax walm"" outputs ""yellow red green green green,"" where ""zup"" produces ""yellow,"" ""wif"" produces ""red"", and ""dax walm"" generates ""green"" repeated thrice.
3. ""dax walm"" alone leads to ""green green green,"" indicating that ""dax walm"" consistently results in ""green"" repeated thrice.
4. ""zup walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which shows ""zup"" followed directly by ""walm"" turns into ""yellow"" repeated thrice.
5. ""zup walm dax lug"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow green blue,"" suggesting that ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow"" repeated thrice, then ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""lug"" is ""blue.""

From these observations, the rule for what ""walm"" means seems to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" is preceded directly by ""dax,"" it outputs ""green"" repeated three times. When ""walm"" is preceded directly by ""zup,"" it outputs ""yellow"" repeated three times. The word ""walm"" defines the repetition of the color associated with the word before it, repeating that color three times.

Hence:
walm -> meaning. Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding output.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the input sequence. Here is the breakdown of the patterns noted from the input/output pairs:

- ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- ""bluf"" corresponds to green when it appears after ""dax"" but corresponds to red when it stands alone.
- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to green.

Combining these observations, we can state the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
From the given examples, we can deduce the following:

- Every time the word ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red.""
- Each of the other nonce words (""dax"", ""bluf"", ""zup"", ""lug"") consistently corresponds to a different color in the output (""green"", ""green"", ""yellow"", ""blue"" respectively).

Given this consistent one-to-one relationship between the nonce word ""wif"" and the color ""red"" in the output, we can establish the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
From the given examples, we see that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"". It does not matter where ""zup"" is positioned in the input sequence; its presence always translates to ""yellow"" in the output sequence. Here are the correlations:

1. ""zup wif walm lug"" -> ""yellow red red red blue""
2. ""dax zup walm wif walm"" -> ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red""
3. ""dax zup"" -> ""green yellow""
4. ""lug walm zup lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue""
5. ""zup"" -> ""yellow""

Regardless of context or accompanying words, ""zup"" predicts the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red in the outputs provided.
Based on the provided examples, we can try to induce the rule for the nonce word ""walm."" To figure out the rule, we can look at the corresponding outputs and try to find a pattern that fits with the use of ""walm"" in the input.

Here are the examples re-arranged to better see the pattern:

1. zup dax lug walm zup lug -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
2. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
3. zup wif lug zup walm -> yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
4. zup dax walm -> yellow green green green
5. dax zup walm wif -> green yellow yellow yellow red

Looking at these sequences, we can notice that whenever the word ""walm"" is used, the color corresponding to it becomes green, and the following colors are also green until a new color word is introduced. So, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" changes the current sequence color to green and continues that color until a different color word appears.

Rule: walm -> Changes the current color to green and continues the output as green until the next color word appears.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, independent of its position or the presence of other words.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in each example provided.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the given examples. Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in every given example.
Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following rules for the colors associated with each word:

1. Each occurrence of ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow"".
2. Each occurrence of ""dax"" is followed by ""green"".
3. Each occurrence of ""wif"" is followed by ""red"".
4. Each occurrence of ""lug"" is followed by ""blue"".
5. The number of ""red"" before ""bluf"" matches the number of times ""wif"" appears before it and the number of colors after ""bluf"" corresponds to the number of words following it. 

Analyzing the given examples, we see that after ""bluf"" is used, we see a repetition of the color seen before ""bluf"", and this repetition is equal to the number of words that come after ""bluf"". When ""bluf"" stands alone with ""wif"", it simply duplicates the ""red"" color of ""wif"".

Let's deduce the rule for ""bluf"":

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (which corresponds to ""green"") and is followed by one word, which results in one occurrence of ""green"" after ""bluf"".
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red"") and is followed by no words, which results in two occurrences of ""red"".
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" again and is followed by two words, resulting in two ""red"" before ""bluf"" and two colors corresponding to those two words after ""bluf"".
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is preceded by one ""wif"" and followed by no other words, resulting in just one ""red"".
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows two occurrences of ""lug"" (which is ""blue"") and is followed by one word, which results in one ""blue"" recurring after ""bluf"".

Based on the observed patterns, ""bluf"" functions as a duplicator. It duplicates the color associated with the word immediately preceding it for as many times as there are words following it. When ""bluf"" appears at the end, it duplicates the color associated with the preceding word an extra time (since there are no words after it).

Rule: bluf -> causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated as many times as there are words that follow it (including an extra if it is the last word). If it is not followed by any words, the color of the preceding word appears twice. If there is no preceding word with an associated color, the rule is uncertain based on the given evidence.
Reviewing the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning of the word ""walm"" by looking at the sequence and color outputs. Let's break each input/output pair down:

1. ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow""
2. ""dax walm wif zup"" -> ""green green green red yellow""
3. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
4. ""dax walm zup"" -> ""green green green yellow""
5. ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif"" -> ""blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red""

Looking at inputs 1 and 2, we can see that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" In input 3, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" which suggests that ""walm"" following ""wif"" results in a repeated output of ""red."" Similarly, in input 4, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" indicating that ""walm"" following ""dax"" yields a repetition of ""green."" Therefore, it seems that ""walm"" acts as a repetition indicator for the color corresponding to the preceding word.

In input 5, ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif,"" the sequence ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue"" after ""lug"" gives a single ""blue,"" again pointing to ""walm"" causing repetition. However, after ""zup,"" ""walm"" results in ""yellow,"" which does not appear to be a direct repetition of the preceding color. It could be that ""walm"" after ""zup"" has a different rule or that ""zup"" modifies the following ""walm"" somehow.

After analyzing the patterns and considering an exception, the rule I can deduce is:

Walm -> Causes a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that precedes it, except when following certain context-specific rules (as noted in the case with ""zup"").

Rule: If ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it results in repeated ""red."" If it follows ""dax,"" it results in repeated ""green."" If it follows ""lug,"" it results in repeated ""blue."" There is some ambiguity around how ""walm"" behaves after ""zup,"" which may require additional examples to clarify.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup dax
    ",Output: red yellow green,red yellow green,True,138
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

The consistent output associated with the input ""lug"" in all examples is ""blue,"" indicating that the nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""
Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following rules:

1. When ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output is ""green blue."" This suggests that ""dax lug"" corresponds to ""green blue"" specifically.

2. When ""dax"" is followed by ""zup,"" the output is ""green yellow."" This suggests that ""dax zup"" corresponds to ""green yellow"" specifically.

3. When ""dax"" appears alone, the output is simply ""green."" This suggests that ""dax"" on its own corresponds to ""green.""

4. In the fourth example, ""dax"" precedes ""lug"" twice with ""wif"" at the end, and the output shows a repeating ""green blue"" pattern followed by ""red"" for ""wif.""

5. In the fifth example, ""dax"" comes before ""walm wif lug"" and then ""walm"" alone, resulting in a repeating pattern of ""green"" for each ""dax"" and ""walm,"" with ""red blue"" for ""wif lug"" in the middle.

From these examples, we can infer the meanings for the nonce word ""dax"" and the patterns as follows:

Rule: ""dax"" -> ""green""
Additional apparent rule associations:
- ""lug"" following ""dax"" adds ""blue"" to the corresponding output.
- ""zup"" following ""dax"" adds ""yellow"" to the corresponding output.
- ""wif"" on its own corresponds to ""red.""
- ""walm"" either on its own or following ""dax"" corresponds to an additional ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, it can be deduced that the nonce word ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red.""

Here is the evidence supporting this conclusion from the given examples:

- In the first example, ""lug dax wif lug,"" the output is ""blue green red blue."" The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" at both the beginning and end. Therefore, ""wif"" must correspond to ""red.""

- In the second example, ""wif walm dax zup,"" the output is ""red red red green yellow."" Here, ""wif"" and ""walm"" must correspond to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" followed by ""zup"" which is ""yellow.""

- In the third example, ""dax lug wif,"" the output is ""green blue red."" ""dax"" matches with ""green,"" and ""lug"" with ""blue,"" hence ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

- The fourth example, ""zup dax walm zup wif,"" translates to ""yellow green green green yellow red."" ""zup"" matches ""yellow,"" ""dax"" and ""walm"" with ""green,"" which leaves ""wif"" corresponding to ""red.""

- Finally, in the fifth example, ""wif zup,"" the output is ""red yellow."" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" indicating ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Regardless of position or surrounding words, ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow."" The other words correspond to different colors: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" signifies a repetition of the color word that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. The sequence of corresponding colors for each word appears to be consistent across the examples:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow

When ""bluf"" follows any of these words, the color word that comes out is a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word:

- lug wif dax bluf wif lug -> blue red green green red blue
- wif lug bluf -> red blue blue
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow
- lug dax bluf zup lug wif -> blue green green yellow blue red
- lug bluf -> blue blue

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately before bluf.
From the provided examples, we can deduce that the word ""walm"" indicates that the output should repeat the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""walm,"" and it should repeat as many times as the number of syllables in that word. Let's examine the evidence:

- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" is associated with yellow, and ""zup"" has one syllable, so ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
  
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green."" ""Dax"" is associated with green, and ""dax"" has one syllable, so ""green"" is repeated three times.

- ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" results in ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which is associated with the color blue, and ""lug"" has one syllable, so ""blue"" is repeated three times.

- ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" results in ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue."" The first occurrence of ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which is associated with blue (one syllable), hence ""blue"" is repeated three times, and then the pattern continues respectively.

- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red."" ""Wif"" is associated with red, and ""wif"" has one syllable, so ""red"" is repeated three times.

Given these observations, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be that it indicates repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, and the number of repetitions is equal to three times the number of syllables of that word.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word, with the number of repetitions being three times the number of syllables in that word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax wif dax
    ",Output: red green red green,red green red green,True,139
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each given example, regardless of context or position within the input sequence.
dax -> meaning. Meaning is the word ""green"".

Rule: Each occurrence of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green"".
Based on the examples provided, ""wif"" seems to consistently translate to the word ""red."" Look at Output whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the Input; ""red"" always corresponds to it.

Here is the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""wif"" follows ""lug"" and the output for that sequence is ""blue red"".
- In the second example, ""wif"" occurs twice: after ""lug"" with the output ""blue red"" and after ""bluf"" with the output ""green red"".
- In the third example, ""wif"" follows ""dax"" and we have ""green red"" in the output.
- The same pattern holds for the fourth and fifth examples as well.

Rule: wif -> ""red""
Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Here are the direct correlations seen in the examples:

- ""zup dax"" translates to ""yellow green,"" with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow.""
- ""lug wif zup wif walm"" becomes ""blue red yellow red red red,"" where again ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""wif zup lug zup lug"" turns into ""red yellow blue yellow blue,"" where ""zup"" matches up with ""yellow"" in two instances.
- ""lug dax zup"" is ""blue green yellow,"" with ""zup"" standing in for ""yellow.""
- ""zup bluf"" is translated to ""yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""zup"" coincides with ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" possibly being either a free variable that also translates to ""yellow,"" or having no paired input to determine its individual meaning.

Therefore, the rule is: zup -> ""yellow"".
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each nonce word corresponds to a color in the output. The word ""bluf"" corresponds consistently to the color ""yellow.""

Thus, the rule appears to be:

bluf -> yellow

Based on the evidence:
- In every instance where ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output.
- The word ""bluf"" never corresponds to a color other than yellow, regardless of its position in the list of input words.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to examine how the output colors are influenced by the words that precede ""walm.""

In the first input, we have the sequence ""dax walm wif walm"" which leads to the output ""green green green red red red."" Here, ""dax"" seems to correspond to the color ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" as when they are followed by ""walm,"" they produce a repetition of their associated colors three times.

Looking at the second input, ""wif walm zup walm"" translates to ""red red red yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""wif"" is again followed by three ""red,"" and when the new word ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" it produces three ""yellow.""

In the third input, ""lug walm"" becomes ""blue blue blue."" So ""lug"" is associated with the color ""blue.""

For the fourth input, ""dax wif walm"" leads to ""green red red red."" The pattern suggests that the first word ""dax"" gives one ""green,"" and the next word ""wif,"" followed by ""walm,"" gives three ""red.""

The fifth input, ""dax lug walm,"" results in ""green blue blue blue."" Here again, ""dax"" gives one ""green,"" and ""lug"" followed by ""walm"" gives three ""blue.""

From these examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the word immediately preceding it to be outputted as its corresponding color three times.

Using this rule, we can infer the meaning of ""walm"":

Walm -> Repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,140
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the outputs provided.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Every instance where ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the same position in the output.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following correlations for each nonce word or term:

- Every appearance of ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".

Therefore, the rule can be articulated as:

Rule: wif -> ""red""
Based on the examples provided, we can see that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Here's how ""zup"" is matched with the output in each example:

1. Input: dax wif zup dax
   Output: green red yellow green
   ""zup"" occurs one time and corresponds to ""yellow"".

2. Input: zup
   Output: yellow
   ""zup"" is the only word and directly corresponds to ""yellow"".

3. Input: zup bluf dax
   Output: yellow yellow green
   ""zup"" is the first word and corresponds to the first ""yellow"" in the output.

4. Input: zup wif lug wif
   Output: yellow red blue red
   ""zup"" is the first word and corresponds to ""yellow"" at the start of the output.

5. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   ""zup"" is the second word and corresponds to the first ""yellow"" in the output, followed by repetitions of the same color for ""walm,"" showing that ""zup"" alone is ""yellow"".

Considering that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" irrespective of its position or the context in the input, we can deduce the meaning of ""zup"" with the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the provided examples, we can infer that ""bluf"" translates to the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Here is the breakdown of the examples and their corresponding outputs:

1. zup bluf wif dax lug -> yellow yellow red green blue
   - 'zup' means yellow, so 'bluf' following it means yellow.
   - 'wif' means red, so 'bluf' following it is not used in this instance.
   - 'dax' means green, so 'bluf' following it is not used in this instance.
   - 'lug' means blue, thus 'bluf' means blue when following it.

2. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
   - 'zup' means yellow, so 'bluf' following it is not used in this instance.
   - 'dax' means green; thus 'bluf' following it means green.

3. lug bluf -> blue blue
   - 'lug' means blue, so 'bluf' following it means blue.

4. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
   - 'lug' means blue, so 'bluf' following it is not used in this instance.
   - 'wif' means red, so 'bluf' following it means red.

5. lug bluf -> blue blue
   - 'lug' means blue, so 'bluf' following it means blue again.

Considering the consistency across examples, the rule we can induce is:

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color meaning of the word that precedes it.
walm -> meaning. Rule:

Based on the provided input and output pairs, ""walm"" seems to result in a repeated color in the output, with the number of repetitions based on the position of ""walm"" in the input. The specific color depends on the word before ""walm"". Here's the breakdown:

1. ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"". ""dax"" seems to correspond to the color ""green"", and the fact that it is followed by ""walm"" suggests that ""walm"" causes the preceding color to be repeated three times.

2. ""wif walm dax"" leads to ""red red red green"". ""wif"" seems to correspond to the color ""red"", and ""walm"" causes it to be repeated three times, followed by the color for ""dax"", which is ""green"".

3. ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"". ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"", and ""walm"" causes it to be repeated three times.

4. ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"". Again, ""wif"" represents ""red"", and ""walm"" causes it to be repeated three times.

5. ""dax lug walm"" leads to ""green blue blue blue"". Here, ""dax"" is ""green"", but ""lug"" seems to replace it and corresponds to the color ""blue"". As ""walm"" follows, it causes ""blue"" to be repeated four times.

It's important to note that in the last example, the presence of two words before ""walm"" doesn't impact the repetition rule, but ""lug"" alters the repeated color. The number of times the color is repeated depends on the position of ""walm"" in the sequence. When ""walm"" is in the second position, the color repeats three times, and when in the third position, it repeats four times.

To condense the pattern into a rule with all the given information:
""Walm"" causes the preceding word's corresponding color to be repeated, with the number of repetitions equal to two plus the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.

Hence, the induction for ""walm"" is: 

walm -> Repeats the preceding color according to its positional rule (position of ""walm"" + 2)

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,141
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"". Each instance of ""dax"" in the input results in ""green"" appearing in the same position in the output.

Thus, the rule seems to be:

- dax -> green

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, it is replaced by ""green"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each non-word correlates with a color. Moreover, the colors appear to follow a specific sequence, irrespective of the non-word's position in the input. Observing the outputs, we can deduce the following:

- ""lug"" consistently translates to blue.
- ""walm"" consistently translates to green.
- ""bluf"" consistently translates to blue.
- ""dax"" consistently translates to green.
- ""zup"" consistently translates to yellow.

Now, looking specifically at the examples that include ""wif"":

1. ""wif"" is followed by three ""red"" in the output when it comes before ""lug"" and ""bluf"".
2. ""wif"" is followed by one ""red"" in the output when it appears after ""walm"".
3. ""wif"" is followed by one ""red"" in the output when flanked by ""dax"".
4. ""wif"" directly translates to ""red"" when it follows ""zup"".

Considering the above observations, ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red"" in each instance. It doesn't seem to matter where ""wif"" appears in the sequence—it consistently maps to ""red"". Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Other words such as ""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""dax,"" and ""wif"" also seem to correspond to specific colors (""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""walm"" to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red""), and their presence in the input does not alter the meaning of ""zup."" As such, it seems that the word ""zup"" is used to represent the color ""yellow"" in every instance provided.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to compare the inputs and outputs to find a consistent pattern.

From the first input:
""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" -> ""yellow blue red green green red""
We see ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" and the corresponding output is ""green red.""

From the second input:
""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""
We observe that ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""dax"" with the corresponding output being ""red green.""

From the third input:
""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
Here ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow.""

From the fourth input:
""dax bluf lug wif"" -> ""green green blue red""
In this case, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green.""

From the fifth input:
""wif bluf dax"" -> ""red red green""
Again, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and translates to ""red.""

Looking at the pattern, it seems that ""bluf"" repeats the color that precedes it. Wherever ""bluf"" is used, it assumes the same color as the word before it.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the previous word in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, let's examine the corresponding output for each occurrence of the nonce word ""walm"":

1. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
2. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
3. zup walm lug -> yellow yellow yellow blue
4. zup walm lug wif -> yellow yellow yellow blue red
5. lug walm zup -> blue blue blue yellow

In each case, ""walm"" seems to correspond to a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

- In the first and second examples, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and maps to ""blue,"" so the repetition after ""walm"" is ""blue blue blue.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" comes after ""zup,"" which maps to ""yellow,"" so ""walm"" here is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" again and maps to ""blue,"" so ""walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue.""
- The fourth example seems to maintain the rule for ""walm"" and adds ""wif"" after ""lug walm,"" which maps to ""red.""

Based on these observations, the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the word before it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug zup
    ",Output: green blue yellow,green blue yellow,True,142
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we need to analyze the context where it is used in each provided example and see what is common across all instances.

In the first example:
Input: dax
Output: green

Here, ""dax"" alone is associated with the color green.

In the second example:
Input: dax zup wif
Output: green yellow red

""dax"" is the first word and is associated with green again. Also, ""zup"" is associated with yellow and ""wif"" is associated with red.

In the third example:
Input: wif dax
Output: red green

""wif"" now occurs before ""dax,"" but it's still associated with red, and ""dax"" remains associated with green.

In the fourth example:
Input: zup lug dax
Output: yellow blue green

""zup"" is again associated with yellow, ""lug"" is new and associated with blue, and ""dax,"" even when it's the third word, is associated with green.

In the fifth example:
Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green

Here, we have ""wif"" associated with red, ""walm"" with red again, and ""dax"" with green at the end.

Looking at all the examples, it seems that each word is associated with a specific color, regardless of its position in the input sequence. ""dax"" consistently maps to the color green, regardless of its position or the words around it.

Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" means green.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" This is evident as each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. The position of ""wif"" in the sequence doesn't matter; it consistently translates to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""zup"", let's analyze the given input-output pairs and look for a pattern:

1. Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
   - ""zup"" translations are ""yellow"" in two different positions. Other words translate consistently to their colors.

2. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue red green green red
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"". All other words maintain consistent color assignments.

3. Input: zup dax lug
   Output: yellow green blue
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".

4. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"". All other words maintain consistent color assignments, with ""walm"" introducing a new consistent color ""green"".

5. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".

From the examples provided, we can see that regardless of the position or context, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"". All other words translate to colors in a consistent manner and do not appear to affect the translation of ""zup"".

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's compare the inputs to their outputs, focusing on the position of ""bluf"" within each sequence:

- dax bluf -> green green
- wif bluf lug -> red red blue
- zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue
- lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue
- dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow

In each case, ""bluf"" follows a word which color is represented in the output. The color represented is not always the same for different words, e.g., ""dax"" is associated with ""green"", and ""wif"" is associated with ""red"". 

The key observation is that ""bluf"" duplicates the color of the word that comes immediately before it. Thus, ""bluf"" seems to act as a duplicating function, repeating the color output of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to be associated with the repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it. In each instance, ""walm"" causes the output to have three of the same color that corresponds to the previous word.

Here's the breakdown:

1. ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"".
2. ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and in ""zup walm wif walm"", ""walm"" results in the repetition of the preceding color (""yellow yellow yellow red red red"").
3. ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"".
4. When ""zup walm"" follows ""lug wif dax"", the ""walm"" repeats the yellow from ""zup"" (""yellow yellow yellow"").
5. ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"", indicating repetition of red.

Therefore, the rule is: walm causes the output to repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup walm
    ",Output: green yellow yellow yellow,green yellow yellow yellow,True,143
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the rule for the nonce word ""lug"":

- When ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears at the end of the output.
- The presence of other words in the input (e.g., ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" ""dax,"" ""walm"") corresponds to other colors appearing in the output.
- ""lug"" itself does not seem to affect the positioning of the other colors in the output; it only ensures that ""blue"" is added at the end.

Rule:
lug -> Add ""blue"" to the end of the sequence of colors in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green."" However, the examples show a pattern where other words correspond to other colors. The rule for other words based on the examples provided appears to be as follows:

- lug -> blue
- walm -> blue
- wif -> red
- bluf -> green
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds with the color ""red"" in the output.

Input: dax zup wif zup
Output: green yellow red yellow
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: zup dax lug wif dax
Output: yellow green blue red green
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: wif
Output: red
- ""wif"" stands alone and corresponds to ""red""

Input: dax wif
Output: green red
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: wif
Output: red
- ""wif"" stands alone and corresponds to ""red""

Based on these observations, the rule can be deduced as:

wif -> red. Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" always translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" whenever it appears in the input.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the preceding word. To confirm this:

- In the first input, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which outputs ""blue,"" and using ""bluf"" after ""lug"" results in another ""blue."" Similarly, ""bluf"" after ""zup"" results in another ""yellow.""
- In the second input, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which outputs ""red,"" and using ""bluf"" afterward also results in ""red.""
- In the third input, ""zup"" outputs ""yellow,"" and after ""bluf,"" there's another ""yellow."" It also shows ""lug"" followed by ""bluf,"" leading to two ""blue"" outputs.
- In the fourth input, ""bluf"" again follows ""wif,"" resulting in two ""red"" outputs.
- In the fifth input, ""dax"" outputs ""green,"" and after ""bluf,"" there's another ""green,"" followed by ""wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""dax,"" each leading to ""red,"" ""yellow,"" and ""green,"" respectively.

Rule:
bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can analyze its effect on the outputs given the inputs provided. Let's examine the repetition of color words following the presence of ""walm.""

- Every time ""walm"" is included, the word that follows ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output. This pattern holds true irrespective of the preceding word (e.g., ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""wif,"" or ""zup"").

For example:

- After ""dax lug walm dax,"" we get ""green blue blue blue,"" where ""blue"" is the color repeated thrice.
- After ""lug walm zup lug,"" we get ""blue blue blue,"" where ""blue"" is the color repeated thrice again.
- It happens similarly with the word ""wif,"" and ""zup,"" where ""red"" and ""yellow"" are the repeated colors thrice respectively after ""walm.""

Based on this consistent pattern across all examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> causes the next word's corresponding output to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,144
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine the output colors associated with the input each time ""dax"" appears and what might differ in these contexts compared with the surrounding words.

1. ""dax"" appears first in the sequence ""dax walm wif bluf"" yielding ""green green green red red."" Since ""walm"" repeats in other inputs and consistently yields ""green,"" we can assume ""dax"" does not mean ""green."" However, since ""dax"" results in ""green"" here, ""dax"" might mean a color other than those represented.

2. ""dax"" appears last in ""wif zup walm dax zup"" yielding ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow."" The color that doesn't appear until ""dax"" is introduced is ""green.""

3. ""dax"" appears second in ""zup dax wif"" yielding ""yellow green red."" Again, ""green"" is the color that correlates with ""dax.""

4. ""dax"" appears last in ""wif bluf dax"" yielding ""red red green."" Yet again, ""green"" is the result when ""dax"" is in the input.

5. ""dax"" appears second in ""zup dax zup lug"" yielding ""yellow green yellow blue."" The color ""green"" associates with ""dax.""

The consistency of ""green"" as the output when ""dax"" appears in the input, regardless of position or surrounding words, suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
bluf -> meaning. Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the color corresponding to the preceding word. If the preceding word is ""lug,"" the color is blue. If the preceding word is ""wif,"" the color is red. If the preceding word is ""zup,"" the color is yellow.
Rule: walm -> ""repeat the color of the previous word""
- In the first input, ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow."" Following ""walm,"" the word ""yellow"" is repeated thrice, indicating that ""walm"" means to repeat the previous color three times.
- In the second input, following ""lug"" which translates to ""blue,"" ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated thrice before the sequence continues.
- The third input reinforces this rule by showing ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- The fourth input once again supports the rule where ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated thrice, despite the sequence having other colors before and after.
- The fifth input further confirms the rule with ""zup walm"" leading to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" and the output continues following ""lug"" which translates to ""blue"" and ""wif"" which translates to ""red.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: 'lug' translates to the color 'blue'.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in each given example.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. zup bluf wif dax lug -> yellow yellow red green blue
2. wif bluf -> red red
3. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue
4. dax lug bluf wif -> green blue blue red
5. dax wif lug -> green red blue

From the above examples, it appears that each time ""wif"" is mentioned, the output is ""red."" It does not seem to matter where ""wif"" appears in the sequence; it consistently translates to ""red."" In the second example, ""wif bluf,"" we also see that ""bluf"" translates to ""red,"" but in the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow."" This shows us that the individual words are likely symbols for colors instead of being context-dependent.

Based on these observations, our rule is:

wif -> red

Meaning that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
Rule: zup -> yellow

The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in each provided example.
Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to mirror or repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. In each output, the color that follows ""bluf"" is a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word before ""bluf."" Here are the observations:

- In ""dax bluf,"" the word ""dax"" correlates to the color ""green,"" and following ""bluf,"" the color is repeated as ""green green.""
- In ""lug bluf wif,"" the word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" causes it to repeat as ""blue blue,"" followed by the color ""red"" for ""wif.""
- In ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif,"" the word ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" resulting in ""blue blue,"" and the second occurrence of ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" which is then repeated because of ""bluf,"" giving ""yellow yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In ""wif bluf,"" the word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" repeats this color as ""red red.""
- In ""zup dax bluf,"" ""dax"" correlates to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" causes ""green"" to repeat, resulting in ""green green,"" with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can look for patterns in the input and output pairs provided. It's clear that the output is a series of colors, so we need to determine how the words in the input correspond to these colors. We will focus specifically on identifying the pattern surrounding the word ""walm.""

Let's consider each example:

1. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
- ""zup"" leads to ""yellow""
- ""lug wif"" leads to ""blue red""

2. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
- ""dax"" leads to ""green""
- ""lug"" leads to ""blue""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""wif"" seems to append a single ""red"" after it

3. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
- ""zup lug"" leads to ""yellow blue""
- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red""

4. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
- ""dax wif"" leads to ""green red""
- What follows after ""walm"" is two additional ""red""

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
- ""dax"" leads to ""green""
- After ""walm"" we have two additional ""green""

Looking through the instances where ""walm"" occurs, it seems to double the color that precedes it. In examples 1, 3, and 4, where ""walm"" is followed by another word leading to ""red,"" it results in two additional ""reds."" In example 5, where ""walm"" is not followed by another color-producing word, its presence results in two additional ""greens,"" which follows the color produced by ""dax.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color two more times.

Hence, ""walm"" causes the color immediately before it to be repeated two additional times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup bluf
    ",Output: red yellow yellow,red yellow yellow,True,146
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" let's examine the patterns before and after the occurrence of ""lug"" in the inputs and outputs:

Input 1: dax lug -> Output 1: green blue
- Here lug seems to result in the output ""blue,"" following the ""green"" which corresponds to ""dax.""

Input 2: wif lug walm -> Output 2: red blue blue blue
- ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" again seems to result in ""blue."" ""Walm"" produces ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting a rule for ""walm"" that results in triple repetition of the color corresponding to it, which is ""blue.""

Input 3: wif lug zup bluf -> Output 3: red blue yellow yellow
- ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" leads to a repeated color, in this case, ""yellow yellow."" 

Input 4: zup bluf lug zup walm -> Output 4: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
- ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" again results in a repeated color ""yellow yellow,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and finally, ""zup walm"" combined to produce ""yellow yellow yellow."" It looks like ""walm"" after another word triples the output for the preceding word. 

Input 5 (identical to Input 1): dax lug -> Output 5 (identical to Output 1): green blue
- This confirms that ""lug"" follows ""dax"" with ""blue.""

Given these observations, it is clear that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the words that precede or follow it. 

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the provided examples, the following patterns emerge related to the nonce word ""dax"" and the corresponding output colors:

- Whenever the sequence starts with ""dax"", the output starts with ""green.""
- Each non-""dax"" word is associated with a particular color in the output.
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""lug"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""blue.""

The rule appears to be that ""dax"" acts as a trigger or a key for a color sequence to start, and in this case, it always starts with ""green."" The following words map to colors, and the sequence of these words does not seem to affect the color they are associated with.

Therefore, the rule is: 

Rule: ""dax"" -> ""green"" at the start of a sequence; other words map consistently to their respective colors regardless of order.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". 

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> the color word that describes the preceding word. When a color word does not precede it, it repeats the color word for the word it follows.

Examples with rule application:

1. dax bluf -> green green (because ""dax"" corresponds to green)

2. lug wif bluf dax lug bluf -> blue red red green blue blue (here ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""dax"" to green, and ""lug"" to blue, and ""bluf"" after ""wif"" and ""lug"" repeats their respective colors)

3. zup bluf wif dax wif zup -> yellow yellow red green red yellow (as ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" to red, and ""dax"" to green, with ""bluf"" repeating ""zup's"" color)

4. wif bluf -> red red (since ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it repeats the color red)

5. zup bluf -> yellow yellow (since ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it repeats the color yellow)
walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word three more times.

Rule: If the previous word corresponds to a color, such as ""dax"" for green or ""lug"" for blue, the word ""walm"" causes that color to be repeated three additional times in the output. If ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow, the output is yellow repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif walm
    ",Output: red red red,red red red,True,147
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".
Based on the examples provided, we can observe that the output color associated with the nonce word ""dax"" is always ""green"". To confirm the rule, we need to check all occurrences of ""dax"":

1) wif dax bluf -> red green green 
2) dax lug wif lug -> green blue red blue 
3) zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> yellow green green red yellow yellow blue 
4) zup lug zup dax -> yellow blue yellow green 
5) zup dax lug dax -> yellow green blue green 

In every case, regardless of its position in the input sentence, ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green"". Therefore, the rule we can induce is simple and independent of the context:

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we should analyze the correlation between the inputs and the outputs in the given examples. Carefully examining the colors associated with the known words in different examples allows us to isolate the effect of ""wif"" on the sequence:

Inputs                              Outputs
dax lug walm zup wif      -> green blue blue blue yellow red
zup walm wif                   -> yellow yellow yellow red
lug dax zup wif                -> blue green yellow red
wif dax wif                       -> red green red
wif walm                           -> red red red

From the examples above, we can infer the following associations:

- ""dax"" generally corresponds to the color green.
- ""lug"" generally corresponds to the color blue.
- ""walm"" generally corresponds to the color blue (first example) but is shown to be yellow in the following examples.
- ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow.

Looking at the word ""wif,"" we see that in every instance where it appears, a ""red"" follows in the output. It does not matter the position of ""wif"" in the input; the output is consistently red right after it. This suggests that ""wif"" translates directly to the color red. Additionally, the word following ""wif"" repeats the color that aligns with it, except in cases where ""wif"" appears at the end or there are two instances of ""wif.""

- In the first example, the word following ""wif"" is absent since ""wif"" is at the end of the sequence, thus no repetition of any color.
- In the second and third examples, the word following ""wif"" repeats the color associated with that word.
- In the fourth example, the two instances of ""wif"" result in two instances of ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is transformed into ""red"" due to the preceding ""wif,"" overriding the usual color association.

Based on these observations, we can establish the rule for ""wif:""

Rule: ""wif"" -> changes the next word's color to red; if ""wif"" is the last word, or if there's another ""wif"" following, it will be represented as red itself.
To understand what ""zup"" means in this context, let's analyze the transformations from input to output:

Input: wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow
- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""walm"" -> ""red""
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""

Input: zup wif lug zup walm
Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- ""walm"" -> repeated ""yellow"" (indicates ""zup"" might introduce a repetition of the previous color)

Input: wif lug zup
Output: red blue yellow
- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""

Input: zup dax lug
Output: yellow green blue
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- ""dax"" -> ""green""
- ""lug"" -> ""blue""

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" -> not previously seen, but because ""zup"" precedes it and the output is ""yellow yellow"", it suggests ""bluf"" -> ""yellow"" or ""zup"" again induces a repetition.

From these observations, it seems that ""zup"" consistently outputs ""yellow"". The role of ""zup"" in relation to ""walm"" in the second example warrants further analysis, but based on the available examples, it does not seem to affect any other word except for possibly ""bluf"". With just these examples, the following rule can be deduced:

Rule: zup -> yellow

However, given the ambiguity about what happens when ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"", no additional rules regarding possible repetitions can be ascertained from the provided examples.
Given the examples provided and examining the pattern of input and output sequences, here's the rule I've deduced:

bluf -> yellow

However, we also need to consider the context provided by the other words. It seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when preceding or following certain words. We also notice that other words such as ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and ""wif"" consistently result in ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" ""green,"" and ""red"" respectively.

If we examine the instances where ""bluf"" is used, it always translates to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the context provided by the other words. This consistent translation across different contexts suggests that ""bluf"" is not dependent on surrounding words to determine its meaning.

Therefore, the rule is:
bluf -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" affects both its preceding and following words by repeating their corresponding outputs. Here is the analysis:

1. In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and it is followed by ""walm"" which results in two additional ""green.""
   Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green

2. In the second example, ""dax"" again precedes ""walm"" and is again followed by two more ""green.""
   Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow

3. The third example reinforces the idea as ""dax walm"" gives only green outputs.
   Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

4. The fourth example includes multiple instances of ""walm"" and shows that after every instance of ""wif walm,"" there are two ""red"" and after ""lug walm,"" there are two ""blue.""
   Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

5. The fifth example demonstrates that after ""lug walm,"" we once again observe two ""blue.""
   Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

Based on this, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the color of the output corresponding to the immediately preceding word twice. For instance, ""dax"" yields ""green,"" and when followed by ""walm,"" it becomes ""green green green"" (one for ""dax"" and two repetitions for ""walm"").

Rule: walm -> causes the output color corresponding to the word immediately before it to repeat twice.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif
    ",Output: green red,green red,True,148
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in all given examples.
Based on the examples provided, the meaning of ""dax"" is consistent across all inputs: it corresponds to the color ""green.""

Therefore, the rule is: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red

Each instance of ""wif"" in the inputs directly corresponds to ""red"" in the outputs. Regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words, ""wif"" always translates to ""red.""
Based on the example inputs and corresponding outputs provided, each word seems to correlate to a specific color. Such a word-to-color mapping shows us that ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" also translates to ""red,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

In every example, the presence of the word ""zup"" consistently results in the output ""yellow."" Therefore, we can conclude that:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let us examine each input-output pair and look for the pattern concerning the appearance of ""bluf"" and the corresponding output:

1. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
2. wif bluf -> red red
3. lug wif bluf dax lug bluf -> blue red red green blue blue
4. wif bluf -> red red
5. zup bluf -> yellow yellow

Upon examination, we notice that whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output repeats the color associated with the word just before ""bluf."" 

Let's verify this pattern:
- In example 1, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and this is followed by ""green green"" when ""bluf"" appears.
- In example 2, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and this is followed by ""red red"" when ""bluf"" appears.
- In example 3, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and ""lug,"" which correspond to ""red"" and ""blue,"" respectively, and when ""bluf"" appears after each, the color of the preceding word is repeated.
- Examples 4 and 5 are consistent repeats of the patterns seen in examples 2 and 1, respectively.

Based on the pattern observed in the examples provided, the rule for ""bluf"" can be stated as:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be associated with the repeated color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it. The number of times the color is repeated also matches the number of letters in the word ""walm."" Since ""walm"" has four letters, the corresponding color is outputted three times (one less than the number of letters in ""walm""). Let's look at the examples to see the pattern:

1. ""zup walm"" turns out to be ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow and since ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" it suggests that ""walm"" means to repeat the preceding color three times.

2. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue blue blue."" Here ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""lug"" to blue, with ""walm"" causing the preceding color to be repeated three times.

3. ""lug walm wif bluf"" becomes ""blue blue blue red red."" ""Lug"" corresponds to blue and is followed by ""walm,"" which is why blue is repeated three times. ""Wif"" corresponds to red, which is not changed or repeated because it is not followed by ""walm.""

4. ""zup walm lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" Since ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" yellow is repeated three times. ""Lug"" corresponds to blue, but without a ""walm"" following it, there is no repetition.

5. ""dax wif walm lug zup"" becomes ""green red red red blue yellow."" ""Dax"" corresponds to green and is not repeated because it is not followed by ""walm."" ""Wif"" corresponds to red and is followed by ""walm,"" which causes red to be repeated three times. ""Lug"" correlates with blue and ""zup"" with yellow, both not repeated as ""walm"" does not follow.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
Based on the examples given, it appears that each occurrence of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to the output ""green,"" regardless of its position within the sequence. Other words correspond to other colors consistently (e.g., ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""), while ""wif"" changes the following word color to red. Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" consistently. Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following pattern:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word that follows it (e.g., ""walm lug"" is ""green blue"", so ""walm"" makes ""lug"" repeat its color, hence ""green green blue"").

Given this pattern, we can interpret ""zup"" in the examples:

- When ""zup"" is used, the output is ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Thus, ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Hence the rule is:

zup -> meaning: ""yellow""
Based on the input-output pairs given, it appears that each word correlates with a specific color. Thus, the task is to deduce the color associated with the word 'bluf.' To do this, we can look at the color that 'bluf' corresponds with in each provided sequence.

- In the first input, ""dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green red red,"" where 'dax' corresponds to 'green' and 'wif' corresponds to 'red.' Since 'bluf' appears last and the last color in the output is 'red,' it suggests 'bluf' might mean 'red.'
  
- In the second input, we already know the colors for 'wif,' 'dax,' and 'lug' from previous examples, so when 'bluf' appears, it also corresponds to 'yellow.' The remaining color is 'blue,' which correlates with 'lug' twice but that doesn't align with the first example of 'bluf.'

- The third input gives a direct pair ""zup bluf"" and ""yellow yellow,"" where 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow,' indicating that 'bluf' could also mean 'yellow.'
  
- In the fourth input, 'wif' is 'red' and 'dax' and 'walm' are both 'green.' 'Bluf' corresponds to 'red' again here, but this is complicated by the fact that it is following 'wif,' which is also 'red.'

- The fifth input, ""lug wif lug dax bluf,"" has the output ""blue red blue green green."" Since we know the colors for 'lug,' 'wif,' and 'dax,' and since 'bluf' results in 'green,' it suggests 'bluf' might mean 'green.'

Upon reviewing the outputs associated with 'bluf,' it seems there's an inconsistency, as 'bluf' corresponds with 'red,' 'yellow,' and 'green' in different contexts. To resolve this, let's consider the possibility that 'bluf' might be context-dependent or a rule might apply rather than a direct one-to-one corresponding color.

Given the complexity and inconsistency of the results of 'bluf,' I will attempt to look for patterns that might suggest a rule:
- Every time 'bluf' appears, it is the same color as the word that precedes it.
- 'bluf' takes the color of 'wif,' 'zup,' 'wif' (again), and 'dax,' all of which it followed.

Considering this pattern, the rule seems to be:

Bluf -> Takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: If 'bluf' follows another word, its output color matches the output color of the word that comes right before it.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word in the sequence. Here is the breakdown of the examples and how the word 'walm' changes the output:

1. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   Rule: 'walm' repeats the color of 'zup' three times.

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Rule: 'walm' repeats the color of 'dax' three times.

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Rule: 'walm' repeats the color of 'lug' three times.

4. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   Rule: 'walm' repeats the color of 'lug' three times, before moving on to 'dax'.

5. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Rule: 'walm' repeats the color of 'wif' three times.

Rule: walm -> The word 'walm' causes the color of the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Input: lug dax
    ",Output: blue green,blue green,True,150
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Regardless of the context in which ""lug"" appears, it translates to ""blue"".
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following:

- When the word ""dax"" appears on its own or among other words, the output is always ""green.""
- Other words in the sequence produce different colors, e.g., ""lug"" produces ""blue,"" ""zup"" produces ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" presumably contributes to producing ""green"" given the third example (however, ""wif"" appears to transform ""walm"" into ""red"").
- The transformation to color output appears to be consistent for each word regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green. The meaning of ""dax"" in this context is the color ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the output. Each other word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" but is redundant due to the format of the input suggesting that ""wif"" is already represented by ""red."" Therefore, ""bluf"" does not appear in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following patterns:

- When the input is ""wif walm dax zup,"" the corresponding output is ""red red red green yellow."" Each word except for ""zup"" corresponds to the color red, but after the word ""zup"" is introduced, the colors change to green and yellow.

- When the input is simply ""zup,"" the output is yellow, indicating that the word ""zup"" itself translates to yellow.

- In the examples where ""zup"" is followed by another word, the output always starts with yellow, corresponding to ""zup,"" followed by another color, which depends on the second word.

Combining these observations, the rule appears to be as follows:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and its presence in a sequence does not appear to affect the color associated with the words that follow it.
Based on the provided examples, we can observe a pattern that relates the word ""bluf"" to the output color ""green"". To establish a rule, we need to look at each instance where the word ""bluf"" is used and analyze the corresponding output:

1. ""zup dax bluf"" results in ""yellow green green"". Here, ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" and ""dax"" results in the first ""green"". The presence of ""bluf"" leads to the second instance of ""green.""

2. ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"". ""wif"" results in ""red"", and with ""bluf"" following it, another ""red"" is outputted. But since ""bluf"" consistently relates to ""green"", it is implied that this second ""red"" is not due to ""bluf"".

3. ""zup wif bluf"" gives us ""yellow red red"". Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""wif"" to ""red"". Again, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" but ""red"" appears related to ""wif"" and not to ""bluf"".

4. ""wif bluf dax lug"" gives us ""red red green blue"". ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""bluf"" (as previously established) seems to correspond to ""green"", ""dax"" just before it also corresponds to ""green"", and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

5. ""wif zup dax bluf"" gives us ""red yellow green green"". Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""bluf"" appears again related to an instance of ""green"".

Given the information, it seems that every instance where ""bluf"" appears, a ""green"" follows in the output. Thus, it appears the rule is that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green"".

Rule: bluf -> green
To deduce the meaning for the word ""walm"" based on the examples provided, let's first examine the pattern of the outputs:

- Every time the word ""walm"" appears, the output consists of repetitions of the same color word.
- ""walm"" follows another word that seems to correspond to a specific color in the output.

From this, we can observe that ""walm"" causes the color word that precedes it to repeat.

Here is the breakdown:

1. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" corresponds to ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue"". The word ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the word ""yellow"" then repeats three times.
   
2. ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red"". The word ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and the word ""red"" repeats three times.

3. ""zup bluf wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red red red"". The word ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and the word ""red"" repeats three times.

4. ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green"". The word ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the word ""green"" repeats three times.

5. ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow"". The word ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the word ""yellow"" repeats three times.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" takes the last mentioned color (or possibly, any property or characteristic represented by the word that immediately precedes ""walm"") and repeats it three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color mentioned immediately prior three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup walm dax lug
    ",Output: blue yellow yellow yellow green blue,blue yellow yellow yellow green blue,True,151
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. 

Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the given examples. Each time ""lug"" is mentioned, the output includes the color blue.
Upon examining the examples provided, we can infer the following:

- In the first example, ""zup dax lug"" translates to ""yellow green blue."" Therefore, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

- In the second example, ""dax lug dax"" becomes ""green blue green."" This reaffirms that ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""lug"" is ""blue.""

- The third example, ""dax walm,"" translates to ""green green green."" This suggests that both ""dax"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""green.""

- In the fourth example, ""wif dax lug"" translates to ""red green blue."" Therefore, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue.""

- The fifth example, ""lug dax,"" becomes ""blue green."" Once again, ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""dax"" is ""green.""

Given these examples, it is apparent that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in all instances.

Rule: dax -> green
Observing the inputs and outputs, we can induce the following rule:

- Each non-wif word corresponds to a color. 'dax' corresponds to 'green', and 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'. 'walm' also corresponds to 'blue' (as seen in the second example), and 'bluf' corresponds to 'red' (as seen in the last example).
- 'wif' always results in the output 'red', regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red'.
Based on the examples provided, we can analyze the pattern of where ""zup"" occurs and what the corresponding output is.

- In the first example, ""lug zup dax lug dax"" corresponds to ""blue yellow green blue green."" Here, ""zup"" is between ""lug"" and ""dax,"" and in the output, ""yellow"" is between ""blue"" and ""green.""

- In the second example, ""zup lug bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue."" Here, ""zup"" precedes ""lug,"" and in the output ""yellow"" precedes ""blue.""

- In the third example, ""zup lug zup lug wif"" corresponds to ""yellow blue yellow blue red."" ""zup"" appears twice, each time before ""lug,"" and is replaced twice by ""yellow.""

- In the fourth example, ""zup lug dax lug"" corresponds to ""yellow blue green blue."" ""zup"" precedes ""lug"" and translates to ""yellow.""

- In the fifth example, ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" corresponds to ""green red yellow yellow red red red."" In this case, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and translates to ""yellow.""

From all these examples, we can deduce that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words around it.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: The word ""bluf"" means ""to repeat the color word that directly precedes it"".

Evidence:
- In ""lug bluf dax bluf"", ""lug"" is followed by ""blue"" and ""dax"" is followed by ""green"". Each is followed by ""bluf"", which results in a repeat of the color (""blue blue green green"").
- In ""dax bluf zup bluf dax"", ""dax"" is green and ""zup"" is yellow. When followed by ""bluf"", the previous colors are repeated to result in the sequence (""green green yellow yellow green"").
- In ""wif bluf"", since ""wif"" is red, the ""bluf"" repeats the color to form ""red red"".
- In ""wif dax bluf"", ""wif"" is red and followed by ""dax"" which is green. ""Bluf"" then repeats the preceding color ""green"" to give ""red green green"".
- In ""wif bluf dax"", ""bluf"" repeats the color ""red"" since it directly follows ""wif"", resulting in ""red red"", and then ""dax"" follows as green. 

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: To repeat the preceding color.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can examine the relationship between the inputs and outputs, paying attention to where ""walm"" occurs and the corresponding colors in the output:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

In this case, ""walm"" appears twice, and the colors after ""walm"" are red and blue in each instance. Notably, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue."" However, since ""red"" is always before ""walm,"" we cannot determine if the output is due to ""walm"" or ""wif.""

2. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Here, ""lug"" precedes and follows ""walm,"" and ""lug"" is associated with ""blue."" Since ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"" and appears after ""walm,"" there seems to be a consistent pattern that ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the color of the preceding word.

3. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue

In this sequence, ""walm"" is again followed by the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word (""lug"" -> blue).

4. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow

Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which is associated with ""yellow,"" and the color yellow repeats after ""walm.""

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

Finally, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the result is a repetition of the color blue.

From these examples, we can induce that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the word that appears immediately before it. Specifically, ""walm"" seems to produce two instances of the color that would correspond to the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately before it in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" seems to consistently produce the output ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other words. Here is the rule deduced from the examples:

- ""dax lug"" produces ""green blue,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" implying ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""lug walm"" produces ""blue blue blue""; here ""lug"" stands for the first ""blue,"" and given that ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" two more times, it could be inferred that ""walm"" means repeating ""blue"" twice.
- A single ""lug"" produces ""blue,"" confirming that it stands alone for ""blue.""
- ""wif lug"" produces ""red blue,"" suggesting that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" while ""lug"" maintains its meaning as ""blue.""
- ""lug walm wif bluf"" produces ""blue blue blue red red,"" where ""lug"" is the first ""blue,"" ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" twice more, ""wif"" produces ""red,"" and the new term ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the second instance of ""red.""

Rule: lug -> blue.
Rule: dax -> green

Using the examples provided, it appears that whenever the nonce word ""dax"" is used in the input, the output is ""green."" The position of ""dax"" in the series of words does not seem to matter, as it consistently corresponds to ""green"" regardless of the sequence. This suggests that ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to infer the meaning or the rule that defines the nonce word ""wif.""

- In the first example, the sequence ""lug walm wif bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red red."" Here, ""lug"" consistently correlates with ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" is associated with ""red."" Given that ""walm"" appears only once and is translated as ""blue,"" it doesn't offer enough information for a rule specific to ""walm."" However, the introduction of ""wif"" results in a change from ""blue"" to ""red.""

- In the second example, the sequence ""lug wif lug wif lug"" translates to ""blue red blue red blue."" Here, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and the introduction of ""wif"" consistently results in ""red.""

- The third example, ""wif dax zup wif,"" translates to ""red green yellow red."" Here, ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow."" Notably, ""wif"" correlates with ""red"" at both the beginning and the end of the sequence.

- The fourth example, ""zup lug wif,"" translates to ""yellow blue red."" Again, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and the appearance of ""wif"" at the end translates to ""red.""

- The fifth example, ""lug wif bluf,"" translates to ""blue red red."" Here, ""wif"" follows ""lug"" and translates to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" consistently correlates with ""red.""

Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Therefore,

wif -> red.
Based on the patterns shown in the examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the Output. Here's how this lines up:

- Example 1: ""wif bluf lug zup"" translates to ""red red blue yellow"". ""Zup"" is at the end and translates to ""yellow"".
- Example 2: ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue"". ""Zup"" is at the beginning this time and still translates to ""yellow"".
- Example 3: ""dax lug zup dax"" translates to ""green blue yellow green"". ""Zup"" is in the middle and translates to ""yellow"" with the surrounding words being translated consistently to their corresponding colors.
- Example 4: ""dax bluf zup"" translates to ""green green yellow"". ""Zup"" appears at the end again and translates to ""yellow"".
- Example 5: ""lug walm zup walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow"". In this case ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" which seems to have a one-to-one color translation; both these words repeated an equal number of times and translate to ""yellow"" repeated the same number of times. ""Zup"" remains consistent as ""yellow"".

The rule seems to be that irrespective of position or repetition, ""zup"" is consistently translated to ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow.
bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red"".
To deduce what ""walm"" means in this context, let's look at the repeated patterns between the inputs and outputs:

1. ""lug zup dax walm"" -> ""blue yellow green green green""
2. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" -> ""green blue blue blue yellow red""
3. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
4. ""zup dax walm zup wif"" -> ""yellow green green green yellow red""
5. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red green""

In examples 1, 3, and 4, ""walm"" is followed by repetitions of the color word that precedes it. Specifically, in examples 1 and 4, ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"" is followed by ""walm,"" which results in repeated ""green"" outputs.

Similarly, in example 3, ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"" is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in repeated ""yellow"" outputs (three times, which matches the number of times ""walm"" appears).

In example 2, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and the occurrence of ""walm"" results in repeated ""blue"" outputs following it. However, there is a red color at the end that doesn't seem to be associated with other patterns we've observed.

In example 5, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and again, ""walm"" causes repeated ""blue"" outputs before the pattern changes with ""wif"" which then maps to ""red,"" and ""dax"" which maps to ""green.""

By synthesizing these patterns, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color that immediately precedes it to be repeated in the output until a different color code or a word that interrupts the pattern such as ""wif"" appears.

Therefore:
walm -> meaning: Repeat the preceding color in the output until a different color code appears or the pattern is interrupted by a specific word (e.g., ""wif"").

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf lug walm
    ",Output: yellow red blue blue blue,yellow yellow blue blue blue,False,153
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the outputs.
Based on the provided examples, each instance of the word ""dax"" correlates with the color green in the output. There is a one-to-one relationship between ""dax"" and the color green regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Thus, we can formulate the following rule:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" does not correspond to a consistent color output but rather to a rule or pattern that affects the color associated with the word that follows ""bluf"". 

Looking through the examples:

1. ""zup bluf wif dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow red green blue""
2. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
3. ""wif bluf lug"" -> ""red red blue""
4. ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green yellow red green green""
5. ""lug wif lug bluf"" -> ""blue red blue blue""

In the second example, we see that 'bluf' is followed by no word, yet the output is ""yellow yellow"". This suggests that 'bluf' on its own does not produce an output, and only affects the output of the words that comes after it. Therefore, if nothing follows 'bluf', there seems to be no change or additional output.

In the first and third examples, the output color for ""bluf"" is the same as the word after it (in the first case, ""wif"" outputs red, and ""bluf"" also leads to ""red"" appearing in the output; in the third case, ""lug"" outputs blue, and ""bluf"" precedes an additional ""blue"" in the output).

In the fourth and fifth examples, where words are repeated within the input, the color sequence follows the words accordingly until ""bluf"" appears. After 'bluf', however, the color that should follow is repeated (in the fourth example, after ""bluf"" we should expect ""yellow"" but we get ""green green""; in the fifth example, after ""bluf"" we get an extra ""blue"" output).

From this, we can deduce that 'bluf' induces the output color of the following word to be repeated once, effectively duplicating the color output of the word that comes after 'bluf'.

Rule: bluf -> Duplicate the output colour of the following word. If there is no word following 'bluf', there is no additional or altered output.
Observing the outputs that follow the input including ""walm,"" it seems that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""walm,"" and it repeats that color multiple times. This repetition varies but always includes the last color before ""walm"" itself.

Let's examine the examples:

1. ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" which precedes ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times after it.

2. ""dax lug wif walm"" results in ""green blue red red red."" In this case, ""wif,"" which comes right before ""walm,"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""red"" is repeated three times.

3. ""zup wif dax walm"" results in ""yellow red green green green."" Here, ""dax"" is before ""walm,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and ""green"" is then repeated three times.

4. ""wif walm dax"" results in ""red red red green."" ""Wif"" comes before ""walm"" and corresponds to ""red,"" and ""red"" is repeated three times before the next color that is not part of the ""walm"" sequence.

5. ""dax walm wif dax"" results in ""green green green red green."" In this sequence, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and is linked to ""green."" ""Green"" is then repeated three times, then the sequence continues as normal after ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"" in the input to be output multiple times (specifically, three times based on the provided examples).

Thus, we can summarize that:

walm -> means that the color corresponding to the word right before it is repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, a consistent pattern can be observed as follows:

- Whenever the input ""lug"" appears, the corresponding output is ""blue"".

No matter the placement or the repetition of ""lug"" within the input, the output remains the same. Hence, the rule can be simply stated as:

lug -> meaning: blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position within the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we need to look for patterns in each example and make a reasonable assumption based on the given context.

Given examples:

- Input: wif
  Output: red

- Input: wif walm
  Output: red red red

- Input: dax walm wif zup
  Output: green green green red yellow

- Input: zup wif
  Output: yellow red

- Input: wif lug
  Output: red blue

Observations:

1. When the input is only ""wif,"" the output is solely ""red.""
2. When ""wif"" is added to another word, it repeats the color of that word for the preceding words.
   - In ""wif walm,"" walm's corresponding color is not directly known, but we see ""red red red,"" implying that ""wif"" might require the color of ""walm"" to be red and it repeats it.
   - In ""dax walm wif zup,"" we see that whatever the colors for ""dax"" and ""walm"" are, they are the same, and ""wif"" follows by repeating that color (""green"") before moving on to its own color ""red"" for ""wif"" itself and then producing ""yellow"" for ""zup,"" which seems like an unrelated effect.
3. In ""zup wif,"" the color ""yellow"" corresponds to ""zup,"" and then ""red"" follows, which matches ""wif's"" own established color.
4. Lastly, ""wif lug"" pairs ""red"" with ""wif"" as consistent with all other examples and ""blue"" possibly as the color for ""lug.""

Given this information, ""wif"" seems to be tied to the color ""red,"" but there seems to be a rule affecting preceding words when ""wif"" follows them—causing repetition.

Thus, the tentative rule derived from the given context is:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" and when it follows other words, it causes the output to repeat the color of the most recent word/noun preceding it before giving its own color output.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output. Every time ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the exact same position in the output.

Thus, the rule is:

zup -> yellow.
Rule: bluf means repeating the color of the previous word. 

Evidence:
In the first example, ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue green green,"" where ""bluf"" repeats the color green, which was the color of ""dax.""

In the second example, ""wif zup bluf lug"" translates to ""red yellow yellow blue."" Here, ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.

In the third example, ""zup dax bluf"" becomes ""yellow green green,"" where ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""dax,"" green.

In the fourth example, ""zup bluf wif dax lug"" becomes ""yellow yellow red green blue,"" and ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" repeating the yellow color.

In the last example, ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red,"" with ""bluf"" repeating the color of ""wif,"" which is red. 

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" is to repeat the color of the word that comes just before it. 

bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color of the previous word.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in the input examples and their corresponding outputs:

1. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
2. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red""
3. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""
4. ""lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue""
5. ""zup walm lug"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue""

From these examples, we can induce that:

- ""dax"" corresponds to a single ""green"" output.
- ""zup"" corresponds to a single ""yellow"" output.
- ""lug"" corresponds to a single ""blue"" output.
- ""bluf"" corresponds to a single ""red"" output.
- ""wif"" seems to be associated with ""red"" as well, though it is not present alone without ""bluf"" in the provided examples.

The notable pattern for ""walm"" is that it seems to result in repeating the color of the word that comes immediately before it three times. Let's verify this:

In the first example, ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""; ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and following ""walm,"" we get ""green"" three times.

In the second example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red""; the word before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" which we've associated with the color ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" we see ""red"" repeated three times.

In the third, fourth, and fifth examples, ""walm"" also seems to repeat the color of the word immediately before it three times.

With this information, we can conclude the following rule:

Rule: walm -> It repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately prior to it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,155
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided:

Input: lug
Output: blue

Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
Output: green yellow red red blue

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

Input: lug wif dax
Output: blue red green

Input: lug
Output: blue

Each occurrence of ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the outputs, regardless of its position among other words.

Rule: lug -> blue.
Observing the provided examples, we can attempt to induce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax."" First, let's examine each input where ""dax"" appears and the corresponding output color.

1. wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   - red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   
2. dax
   - green

3. zup dax walm lug wif
   - yellow green green green blue red

4. wif zup walm dax zup
   - red yellow yellow green yellow

5. dax walm
   - green green green

From these examples, the direct observation is that every appearance of ""dax"" corresponds to the output color ""green."" However, the word ""green"" also appears without ""dax"" present, which suggests that ""dax"" isn't the only word associated with ""green."" Yet, the consistent correlation is that every time ""dax"" is used, ""green"" follows directly after.

Additionally, the appearance of ""dax"" has not been observed to result in any other color but ""green"" in these examples, despite being surrounded by different words in different examples.

Based on this information, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: Each instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" 

Hence:

dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" across all provided examples.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow."" In every instance where ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. This pattern holds true regardless of the position of ""zup"" within the sequence of words. Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns in its use across different examples and how it correlates with the output.

Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
Output: green green red yellow blue
- ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""wif"" and the corresponding output colors are green followed by green and then red.

Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
Output: yellow red green red red
- Here ""bluf"" is at the end. ""zup"", ""wif"", ""dax"", and ""wif"" correspond to yellow, red, green, and red respectively, with ""bluf"" also resulting in a red.

Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif
Output: red red yellow yellow red
- ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" and before ""zup"", and then it appears again after ""zup"", followed by ""wif"", corresponding to red, yellow, and then another yellow before ending again with red.

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue
- ""bluf"" Here follows ""lug"", and both are outputting blue.

Input: zup dax bluf zup dax
Output: yellow green green yellow green
- In this example, ""bluf"" is situated between ""dax"" and ""zup"" resulting in a green color, similar to ""dax"" itself, followed by yellow and then green again as ""zup"" and ""dax"" reappear.

From these inputs and outputs, we can deduce that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red when it follows ""wif"", and to green when following ""dax"". When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", it results in blue. However, it is not sufficient to confirm an absolute rule because the word ""bluf"" gives different outputs depending on the preceding word. The consistent pattern is that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it:
- When preceded by ""dax"" (green), ""bluf"" is green.
- When preceded by ""wif"" (red), ""bluf"" is red.
- When preceded by ""lug"" (blue), ""bluf"" is blue.

Rule: bluf -> color of the preceding word (mimics the color associated with the word directly before it).
Observing the patterns in the given examples, it is possible to induce a rule for the word ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""dax zup walm wif,"" the output is ""green yellow yellow yellow red,"" with ""walm"" corresponding to two instances of ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""dax wif walm lug zup walm,"" the output is ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow,"" with ""walm"" corresponding to two instances of ""yellow"" each time it appears.
- In the third example, ""zup bluf wif walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow red red red,"" with ""walm"" corresponding to two instances of ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif walm,"" the output is ""red red red,"" with ""walm"" corresponding to two instances of ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" with ""walm"" corresponding to two instances of ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the next color in the sequence to repeat. It acts as a duplicator for the subsequent color.

Rule: walm -> causes the next color in the sequence to repeat.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,156
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the outputs presented.
Based on the provided examples, we can infer a rule about the meaning of the word ""dax"", as well as about the other nonce words presented. Here is the analysis:

1. When ""dax"" is the only word in the input, the output is ""green"" (Input: ""dax"", Output: ""green"").
2. When ""dax"" appears after ""wif"", the output for ""dax"" is still ""green"", and the output for ""wif"" is ""red"". This is consistent in both examples where ""wif"" precedes ""dax"" (Inputs: ""wif dax"" and ""wif dax lug dax"", Output: ""red green"" and ""red green blue green"").
3. When ""dax"" appears after ""lug"", the output for ""lug"" is ""blue"" (Input: ""wif dax lug dax"", Output: ""red green blue green"").
4. When ""dax"" appears after ""walm"", the output for ""walm"" is ""green green green"" (Input: ""dax walm"", Output: ""green green green""). In this case, it seems that ""walm"" does not represent a color on its own but rather triples the output of whatever precedes it.

Thus, based on the evidence, we can deduce the meaning of ""dax"" and the associated rule:

Rule: ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence of words. The word immediately preceding ""dax"" dictates its own color output (with ""wif"" translating to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue""), except for ""walm,"" which causes the repetition of the previous color output three times instead of yielding a new color.

dax -> meaning: ""green""
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

- When ""wif"" appears alongside ""zup"" and ""dax,"" the corresponding output colors are ""red yellow green.""
- However, the order of ""wif"" in the input does not seem to affect its output as it is always ""red,"" whether it is before ""zup"" or after ""dax.""
- We also notice that when ""wif"" appears alone, the output is ""red,"" which implies that it doesn't depend on other words to determine its corresponding color.
- Additionally, when ""wif"" appears in a sequence with ""zup"" in various positions, all occurrences of ""wif"" still correspond to the color ""red.""
- In cases where ""wif"" appears alongside ""walm"" and ""dax,"" ""walm"" outputs to 'red' as well, creating a sequence of repeated 'red.'

Based on these observations, we can establish the following rule:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position or the presence of other words in the sequence.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Each time the word ""zup"" is mentioned, the corresponding output is ""yellow."" Therefore, ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow, regardless of the context in which it appears.
Based on the given examples, the rule for the word ""bluf"" seems to be related to its position in the input sequence and its correspondence to a color in the output. Let's examine the outputs related to the presence of ""bluf"" in the inputs:

1. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
2. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
3. dax zup lug bluf -> green yellow blue blue
4. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
5. wif dax bluf -> red green green

The word ""bluf"" corresponds with a doubled color in the output which matches the color of the word immediately preceding ""bluf"":

- In the first example, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and both output to ""yellow"".
- In the third example, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" and both output to ""blue"".
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and both output to ""green"".

In cases where ""bluf"" is the second word, it repeats the color output of the previous word - ""zup"" outputs to ""yellow"" and so does ""bluf"" in the second example.

Based on the pattern from the examples, we can deduce the rule for ""bluf"" as the following:

Rule: bluf -> The output color for ""bluf"" is the same as the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, repeated once.
Based on the provided examples, 'walm' appears to be a directive to repeat the output associated with the previous word in the input sequence. If we consider each unique word in the input is mapped to a specific color in the output, then 'walm' seems to cause the repetition of the color mapped to the word that immediately precedes it.

Let's break down the examples to derive the rule:

In examples 1 and 2, 'dax walm' produces 'green green green', so 'dax' must be associated with 'green'. The repetition of 'green' with the addition of 'walm' suggests that 'walm' corresponds to the repetition of the color code for 'dax'. In the example with 'dax walm lug', 'lug' is associated with 'blue', which is a new color output that does not repeat; thus, 'walm' hasn't affected 'lug'.

In example 3, 'wif walm dax zup' translates to 'red red red green yellow'. Given that 'walm' follows 'wif', which corresponds to 'red', and 'dax' follows 'walm', indicating a switch to 'green', we can deduce that 'walm' is responsible for repeating the 'red' output associated with 'wif'.

In example 4, 'zup wif walm' becomes 'yellow red red red'. Here, 'walm' repeats the color 'red', which is associated with 'wif' that comes right before it.

In example 5, 'wif lug walm' results in 'red blue blue blue'. Since 'lug' precedes 'walm' and the color 'blue' is repeated, 'walm' once again serves as a repetition command for the color associated with the preceding word.

The rule induced from these examples is:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: If 'x' is a word associated with a particular color, then 'x walm' in the sequence will result in the repeated output of that color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax wif lug walm zup
    ",Output: red green red blue blue blue yellow,red green red blue blue blue yellow,True,157
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""lug"" consistently maps to the color ""blue"" in the output. This is seen across all the examples, as ""lug"" is directly translated to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: lug -> blue
Through the analysis of the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax."" Let's examine the occurrences of ""dax"" in each input and their corresponding outputs.

1. Input: zup dax lug wif dax
   Output: yellow green blue red green

2. Input: wif dax
   Output: red green

3. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
   Output: blue green green red green

4. Input: zup lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow blue yellow red green

5. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

We see that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green."" In each output containing ""dax,"" the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position, irrespective of the other words around it. There is no variance in this translation; ""dax"" always results in ""green.""

Therefore, the rule we can deduce from these examples is quite straightforward:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" seems to be translating to the color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" is the immediate output. There doesn't appear to be any variation to this in the examples given. Additionally, the other words seem to correspond to different colors:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> repeated ""yellow"" (the number of syllables in ""walm"" correspond to the number of ""yellow"" in the output)
- bluf -> red (it is repeated as in the second example ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"")
- lug -> blue

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided:

Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
Output: green green red blue yellow

Input: zup bluf dax lug
Output: yellow yellow green blue

Input: zup
Output: yellow

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Input: zup bluf lug zup
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow

The rule seems to be that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the sequence. When we see 'zup' in the input, the output is consistently 'yellow'.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" appears to be as follows:

When the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""green.""

However, there is an additional rule that seems to apply to the outputs corresponding to other words:

- ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" immediately following ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" in the context of the given examples is:

bluf -> green.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" functions as a rule that the color following ""zup"" or ""dax"" should be repeated three times before moving on to the name of the next color. The color sequence changes when a new color word is introduced. Let me parse it in detail:

1. Input: ""zup lug walm wif dax""
   Output: ""yellow blue blue blue red green""
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""dax"" to ""green"". Following ""zup"", the color ""blue"" corresponding to ""lug"" is repeated three times due to ""walm"", before moving onto ""wif"" with single ""red"" and then ""dax"" with single ""green"".

2. Input: ""zup walm dax lug""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow green blue""
   ""zup"" is ""yellow"", which is repeated three times because of ""walm"", and then the pattern changes with new colors for ""dax"" as green and ""lug"" as blue.

3. Input: ""zup walm lug wif bluf""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red""
   Similar to example 2, ""zup"" is ""yellow"", which is repeated three times because of ""walm"". The pattern then changes when new words for colors are introduced: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""wif"" to ""red"". ""bluf,"" not having a corresponding single color in the output, results in the color ""red"" being repeated, which might be due to ""bluf"" ending with ""f"" just like ""wif"".

4. Input: ""zup walm wif""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow red""
   ""zup"" is ""yellow"", again repeated three times due to ""walm"". There are no other color names until ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"", thus the sequence ends with ""red"".

5. Input: ""dax walm""
   Output: ""green green green""
   ""dax"" is ""green"", with ""walm"" causing the ""green"" to repeat three times.

Rule:
walm -> The rule seems to indicate that the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" should be repeated three times. If ""walm"" precedes any words that correspond to colors, it repeats the color for the immediately preceding word, overriding the usual single occurrence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax zup wif
    ",Output: blue green yellow red,blue green yellow red,True,158
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each word corresponds to a specific color in the output:

- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.

Regardless of the position in the sequence, ""lug"" consistently results in the color blue in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue.
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to look at each example where the word ""dax"" is used and the corresponding output. Here's what we have:

1. ""dax walm"" produces ""green green green""
2. ""dax lug"" produces ""green blue""
3. ""dax bluf"" produces ""green green""
4. ""lug zup dax lug dax"" produces ""blue yellow green blue green""
5. ""wif dax lug"" produces ""red green blue""

In the first three examples, we see that the word ""dax"" always corresponds to the output ""green."" Meanwhile, the words that come after ""dax"" produce outputs that are different colors but consistent within themselves (""walm"" produces ""green,"" ""lug"" produces ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" produces ""green"").

Analyzing the fourth example, we notice that the word 'lug' appears both before and after 'dax.' Before 'dax,' 'lug' corresponds to 'blue,' and after 'dax,' it again corresponds to 'blue.' This reinforces the idea that the word after 'dax' does dictate the color that follows 'green.' The word 'zup' is unique and corresponds to 'yellow.'

In the fifth example, the word ""wif"" appears by itself before 'dax' and corresponds to 'red.' After 'dax,' 'lug' is present and still corresponds to 'blue.'

Based on this analysis, we can deduce that ""dax"" signals the color 'green' on its own, and the word that follows dictates the color produced after 'green.' The word before 'dax' does not seem to affect the color 'green' which 'dax' produces.

Rule: dax -> ""green."" The word 'dax' by itself produces 'green,' and it is followed by the color corresponding to the word that immediately follows 'dax,' without affecting or being affected by the word that precedes it.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following pattern:

- Whenever the word ""wif"" is present, the output includes the color ""red.""
- The color that follows ""red"" seems to correspond to the word that follows ""wif.""

Here are the specific examples that demonstrate this pattern:

- ""wif zup"" yields ""red yellow,"" so ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""lug wif bluf"" yields ""blue red red,"" so ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""wif lug"" yields ""red blue,"" which further demonstrates that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""lug walm wif"" yields ""blue blue blue red,"" so ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" yields ""blue red red green blue blue,"" which supports the previously-mentioned rule and indicates that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

With these observations, we can infer the rule:

wif -> red

The presence of ""wif"" in the input always leads to the color ""red"" in the output, followed by a color that corresponds to the next word in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output:

- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- bluf -> green
- wif -> red
- walm -> yellow

The word 'zup' appears to consistently result in the color yellow in the output sequence. 

Rule: zup -> yellow.
bluf -> red when followed by wif, green when followed by dax, blue when standing alone or followed by lug. Rule: The color signified by ""bluf"" depends on the word that follows it.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns of colors that correspond to different words across the five given examples.

- ""lug"" consistently outputs ""blue.""
- ""wif"" consistently outputs ""red.""
- ""zup"" consistently outputs ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" outputs ""green,"" but it only appears once, so let's focus on the more frequent words first.

Now, let's see how ""walm"" modifies the output:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" immediately follows ""lug,"" and the output sequence ends with three ""blue.""
2. In the second example, ""walm"" immediately follows ""zup,"" and the output sequence has three consecutive ""yellow"" before ""blue.""
3. In the third example, ""walm"" again follows ""zup,"" and there are two ""red"" after ""zup,"" then three ""red"" in a row after ""walm.""
4. In the fourth example, ""wif"" follows ""walm"" and the sequence is ""yellow yellow yellow red.""
5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" is at the end, after two ""wif,"" and the output ends in three ""red.""

It appears that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color that corresponds to the prior word. For example:
- After ""lug"" (blue), ""walm"" adds extra ""blue.""
- After ""zup"" (yellow), ""walm"" adds extra ""yellow.""
- After ""wif"" (red), ""walm"" adds extra ""red.""

The repetition varies in count across the examples, but it is consistent in repeating the color that corresponds to the word before ""walm."" Note that ""dax"" only appears once and is followed by ""zup"" (yellow) then ""walm,"" resulting in an output of two more ""yellow"" before the color corresponding to ""wif"" (red).

Thus, ""walm"" seems to be a rule, where ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the color that immediately precedes it in the color sequence.

Rule: Walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

    ",Output: blue green,blue green,True,159
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" is consistently associated with the color ""green."" Every time the input contains the word ""dax,"" the output includes the corresponding color ""green.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be:
dax -> green. 

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, output ""green"" in the corresponding position.
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the word preceding it.

Explanation of rule based on given examples:

1. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
   Here, the word ""dax"" is associated with the color green, and ""bluf"" causes this color to be repeated.

2. ""lug bluf dax lug"" -> ""blue blue green blue""
   ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""bluf"" following ""lug"" repeats the color blue. ""dax"" corresponds to green, and the final ""lug"" is blue.

3. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""
   ""wif"" corresponds to red, repeated by ""bluf."" ""dax"" is green, and ""walm"" seems to cause a repetition of the previous color without the presence of ""bluf.""

4. ""dax bluf lug wif"" -> ""green green blue red""
   ""dax"" is green, repeated by ""bluf."" ""lug"" is blue, and ""wif"" corresponds to red. 

5. ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue""
   ""lug"" is associated with the color blue, which is repeated by ""bluf.""

Thus, ""bluf"" signals the repetition of the color associated with the word before it.
Based on the provided examples, walm seems to refer to the repetition of the last color mentioned before it. Here is the deduction:

1. In the first example, walm comes after lug, which translates to blue, and the output for walm is also blue.
2. In the second example, walm follows wif, which is represented by red, and the output corresponding to walm is blue, which is the color associated with lug mentioned just before wif.
3. In the third example, walm follows dax, which translates to green, and walm outputs green.
4. In the fourth example, walm is after zup, which translates to yellow, and the output for walm is yellow.
5. In the fifth example, zup translates to yellow and it's the only color before walm, resulting in walm also being yellow.

Rule: walm -> the color that corresponds to the last mentioned color word immediately preceding walm. If no color word precedes walm, it repeats the color that corresponds to the noun immediately before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we can look at each input and its corresponding output, and find the commonality where ""dax"" appears.

1. dax walm wif zup -> green green green red yellow
2. dax -> green
3. dax lug zup -> green blue yellow
4. zup wif dax wif bluf -> yellow red green red red
5. dax wif -> green red

In examples 1, 2, 3, and 5, the occurrence of ""dax"" maps directly to the output ""green."" In example 4, ""dax"" is in the third position and correlates with the third ""green"" in the output. Every time ""dax"" appears in an input, its corresponding output is ""green"" regardless of its position or the words around it.

Rule: dax -> green. ""Dax"" represents the color green.
Based on the provided examples, wif translates to a specific color each time. The color that wif corresponds to is not consistently the same across examples; rather, it seems to reflect the last color mentioned before it appears. Here's the breakdown:

Example 1: lug dax walm wif
Output: blue green green green red
- Here, wif appears after three instances of 'green', yet the output is 'red'.

Example 2: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
Output: blue green green yellow blue red
- Here, wif follows 'blue', but again, the output is 'red', indicating that the color is not dependent on the preceding word's associated color.

Example 3: wif walm zup walm
Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
- In this example, wif is the first word and its color is 'red'.

Example 4: wif lug
Output: red blue
- Again, the first word is wif, and it corresponds to 'red'.

Example 5: lug walm wif
Output: blue blue blue red
- Similar to the first example, 'green' precedes wif, but the output color for wif is 'red'.

From these examples, it appears that wif always results in the color 'red', regardless of the previous word's associated color.

Rule: wif -> red
Observing the examples provided, I notice that each time the word ""zup"" appears, the output is the color ""yellow"":

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
Here, ""zup"" corresponds to the third color ""yellow"" in the output.

Input: lug zup lug -> Output: blue yellow blue
Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, being the second color.

Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
""Zup"" as the first word translates to ""yellow"".

Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
In this case, while ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"", producing triple ""yellow"", it is clear that ""zup"" itself is ""yellow"" as it is the only output that appears in all other examples involving ""zup"".

Input: zup dax -> Output: yellow green
""Zup"" is ""yellow"" once again, preceding ""green"" which corresponds to ""dax.""

Based on the data, the rule seems straightforward:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each nonce word corresponds to a particular color. By examining the pairs of inputs and outputs, we can deduce the colors assigned to each nonce word, excluding ""bluf"".

Here's what we can infer:
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Now, observing the repeated pattern in which ""bluf"" is used, we see that it is always paired with outputs that consist of ""yellow"" in the second example and ""blue"" in the others. However, given that ""lug"" has already been established as ""blue"", it is reasonable to assume that ""bluf"" should not mean ""blue"". The second example (Input: zup bluf; Output: yellow yellow) could potentially be an outlier or indicate context dependence.

But since we need to induce a general rule from the given examples, and considering the redundancy of colors would not make sense, our best interpretation of the pattern is to assume that ""bluf"" means ""blue"", given that it is the predominant output linked to ""bluf"" and excluding the second example, which may be an error or an exception.

Rule: bluf -> ""blue""
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" influences the output by repeating the color corresponding to the word preceding ""walm."" To elucidate:

1. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" -> ""yellow red green green green blue""
   - ""zup"" = yellow, ""dax"" = green; ""walm"" follows ""dax"" causing the repetition of green.

2. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
   - ""zup"" = yellow; ""walm"" follows ""zup"" causing the repetition of yellow.

3. ""lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue""
   - ""zup"" = yellow; ""walm"" follows ""zup"" causing the repetition of yellow.

4. ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" -> ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue""
   - ""lug"" = blue; ""walm"" follows ""lug"" causing the repetition of blue.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color given by the word immediately before it a certain number of times, which could depend on context that is not fully clear from the examples given, but seems to be equal to the number of total colors minus two.

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately before it, the number of repetitions appears to be total colors minus two.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax walm wif

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every given example.
Given the examples provided, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" seems to be that it translates to the color ""green."" Each instance of the word ""dax"" in the input corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" is included in the output. It seems that the other words might correspond to other colors: ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. The word ""bluf"" appears only once, but based on its output, it might correspond to the color yellow as well. The repetition in the first input suggests there might be a rule regarding the number of times a color is repeated, but there is not enough data to confirm this.

Rule: wif -> red.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Analyzing the examples:

1. ""wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow,"" where the appearance of the word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

2. ""dax zup lug wif lug"" translates to ""green yellow blue red blue,"" where each word corresponds to a unique color, and ""zup"" again corresponds to ""yellow.""

3. ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red,"" indicating that independently of position, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

4. ""wif zup walm dax zup"" translates to ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow,"" demonstrating that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the surrounding words.

5. ""zup bluf lug zup"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue yellow,"" confirming once more that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and it does so consistently, even when repeated in a sequence.
The pattern seems to be that the word ""bluf"" leads to the repetition of the color associated with the previous word, either a nonce word or an actual word. Here's how the rule applies:

- In the first example, ""wif"" is associated with the color red, and ""bluf"" comes after, resulting in the repeated color red.

- In the second example, ""lug"" is associated with the color blue, and ""bluf"" comes after it, so the color blue is repeated.

- In the third example, ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow, and ""bluf"" follows it, hence the repeated color yellow.

- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" which is associated with yellow, so we see yellow again, and there's no repetition for ""dax"" and ""lug"" since ""bluf"" does not follow them.

- In the fifth example, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and is associated with the color green, hence the repeated color green.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to cause the output to repeat the color word that precedes it three times. Here is the pattern observed:

- ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""

So, in each instance, the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" is repeated exactly three times. The rule seems consistent regardless of the position of ""walm"" in the input.

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it would appear that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue."" Each instance of ""lug"" in the inputs corresponds to ""blue"" in the outputs, regardless of its position or the surrounding words.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, it seems that each nonce word is associated with a color. The task is to determine what color the word ""dax"" corresponds to. By examining each example and corresponding output, we can try to deduce the pattern:

- ""dax lug dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue green blue blue blue."" When ""dax"" appears, the word ""green"" appears in the output.
  
- ""lug zup bluf dax"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow green."" Here ""dax"" is at the end and corresponds to ""green"" at the end of the output series.

- ""dax walm zup lug dax"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue green."" Both times ""dax"" appears, the word ""green"" is used in the output.

- ""zup dax bluf zup dax"" translates to ""yellow green green yellow green."" Here again, every time ""dax"" is mentioned, ""green"" appears in the output.

- ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow red blue green."" Once again, ""dax"" is at the end and ""green"" is the last color in the output.

Based on this consistent association between ""dax"" and the appearance of ""green"" in the corresponding position in the output, the rule seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" translates to the color red. Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in an input, the output includes the color red. Additionally, it can be seen that ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. Here is the inference:

- When ""lug"" is present, it corresponds to blue.
- When ""bluf"" is present, it appears twice as ""red red"", suggesting that ""bluf"" might correspond to just one red in the context but is repeated in the output for some reason.
- When ""zup"" is present, it corresponds to yellow.
- ""wif"" appears alongside other words and always corresponds to red.

Given this, the rule seems to be: ""wif"" -> red.
Rule: zup -> yellow

This rule is derived from the position of the word 'zup' in various input strings and its consistent translation to 'yellow' in each corresponding output. Whenever 'zup' appears in the input, 'yellow' appears in the same position in the output:

- Input: dax zup → Output: green yellow (zup correlating to yellow)
- Input: zup wif dax walm → Output: yellow red green green green (zup as the first word correlating to yellow as the first color)
- Input: zup bluf → Output: yellow yellow (zup correlating to the first yellow)
- Input: dax lug walm zup wif → Output: green blue blue blue yellow red (zup correlating to the fifth color which is yellow)
- Input: zup lug walm → Output: yellow blue blue blue (zup as the first word correlating to yellow as the first color)

Therefore, based on the examples provided, 'zup' translates to 'yellow'.
Rule: bluf means ""repeat the color of the word that comes before bluf"". 
In each instance, the color corresponding to the word just before bluf is repeated after bluf. 

- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"": ""dax"" corresponds to green, bluf repeats that color.
- ""lug bluf dax lug"" -> ""blue blue green blue"": here ""lug"" comes before bluf, which corresponds to blue, so bluf translates to blue.
- ""wif bluf dax lug"" -> ""red red green blue"": ""wif"" comes before bluf and corresponds to red, so bluf translates to red.
- ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow blue yellow yellow"": ""zup"" comes before bluf and corresponds to yellow, so bluf translates to yellow.
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"": ""wif"" comes before bluf and corresponds to red, so once again, bluf translates to red.
From the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of ""walm"" by observing the patterns in the input and their corresponding outputs.

Let's examine each instance of ""walm"" and its output:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   ""walm"" appears twice, and in both instances, the output is a repetition of the color before it three times. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" repeated thrice, and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" repeated thrice.

2. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   ""walm"" appears once after ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"", and the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.

3. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   ""walm"" follows ""wif"", and the output is ""red"" repeated three times, which is the same as the color corresponding to ""wif"".

4. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   ""walm"" appears once after ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"", and the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   ""walm"" follows ""dax"", and the output is ""green"" repeated three times, which is the same as the color corresponding to ""dax"".

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears, the output is the color that corresponds to the immediately preceding word repeated three times.

Therefore,

walm -> meaning: The repetition of the color associated with the previous word, repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,163
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can observe that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the output. Regardless of the context or position in the sequence, whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the same position in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word 'dax' consistently translates to the color 'green.' Here's the breakdown of each example:

- ""dax lug bluf"" -> ""green blue blue""
- ""zup dax lug"" -> ""yellow green blue""
- ""lug dax wif"" -> ""blue green red""
- ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" -> ""green blue red yellow green""
- ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" -> ""red blue green blue red red blue red""
  
In each case, the word 'dax' is followed by the color 'green' in the output.

Hence, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Here is the analysis:

- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"": wif corresponds to the first red.
- ""dax lug dax wif dax"" -> ""green blue green red green"": wif corresponds to the red between the greens.
- ""zup wif zup dax"" -> ""yellow red yellow green"": wif corresponds to the red between the yellows.
- ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue"": wif corresponds to the first red.
- ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" -> ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue"": both instances of wif correspond to red.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"", regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's compare the input phrases with their corresponding output colors:

1. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue
2. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
3. wif zup bluf lug -> red yellow yellow blue
4. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
5. zup bluf dax lug -> yellow yellow green blue

From the first example, we notice that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output. In example three, ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue,"" confirming this pattern. 

The word ""wif"" from examples one and three corresponds to ""red,"" confirming the pattern that ""wif"" equals ""red."" 

The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output of examples two, three, and four.

Looking at the second input-output pair, ""zup bluf,"" it becomes clear that the output is two yellows without a clear distinction or additional color. From examples three and five, we see that ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" itself likely does not have a color.

Given that ""bluf"" always results in the color appearing immediately before it being repeated in the output, we can deduce that ""bluf"" means to repeat the color of the previous word. Hence, ""bluf"" is an instruction rather than a color.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm"". Here's how this rule applies to the examples:

- In ""lug walm"", ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, hence the output is ""blue blue blue"".
- In ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"", the word immediately preceding ""walm"" is ""zup"", which corresponds to the color yellow, hence the output repeats yellow three times after the sequence ""red yellow blue green yellow"".
- In ""wif walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, thus the output is ""red red red"".
- The repetition of the previous example indicates the rule is consistent.
- In ""dax walm"", ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, so the output is ""green green green"".

Rule: walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color associated with the word directly before it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
From the provided examples, we can induce a rule for the meaning of ""lug.""

Looking at each input and corresponding output:

1. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
   The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.

2. Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
   Again, each instance of ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.

3. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
   The standalone ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and the subsequent words correspond to ""red.""

4. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red
   ""lug"" is followed by ""blue,"" irrespective of the preceding colors.

5. Input: lug
   Output: blue
   The standalone ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

The consistent rule that could be induced from these examples is:

Rule: lug -> blue

This rule holds for every instance of the word ""lug"" in the examples, as it always corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Analyzing the given examples:

1. zup dax wif zup -> yellow green red yellow
2. lug wif dax -> blue red green
3. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
4. zup lug dax -> yellow blue green
5. dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> green blue yellow red red green

Looking at the positions of ""dax"" and the corresponding outputs:

- When ""dax"" appears after ""zup"" (Example 1), it translates to ""green"".
- When ""dax"" is at the end after ""wif"" (Example 2), it translates to ""green"".
- When ""dax"" precedes ""lug"" (Examples 3 and 5), it translates to ""green"".
- When ""dax"" is at the end after ""lug"" (Example 4), it translates to ""green"".

In every example, regardless of its position, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"". Therefore, without additional context that indicates otherwise:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the patterns in the examples provided, it looks like ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the corresponding output includes the color ""red.""

The other words in the inputs, ""dax,"" ""walm,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug,"" seem to be associated with their own specific colors: ""dax"" -> ""green,"" ""walm"" -> ""green,"" ""zup"" -> ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" -> ""blue.""

Therefore, from the information given:

wif -> meaning. Meaning: wif corresponds to the color red.

Rule: When the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the output will include the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow. 

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, as consistently seen in the examples provided, where ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: bluf means ""repeat the color of the previous word."" 

In the given examples:
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" outputs ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"" because bluf repeats the color of ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
- ""dax bluf"" outputs ""green green"" because bluf repeats the color of ""dax,"" which is ""green.""
- ""wif dax bluf"" outputs ""red green green"" because bluf repeats the color of ""dax,"" which is ""green.""
- ""wif bluf dax"" outputs ""red red green"" because bluf repeats the color of ""wif,"" which is ""red."" 
- ""wif bluf zup"" outputs ""red red yellow"" because bluf repeats the color of ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

Therefore, bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times.

Here's the breakdown:
- ""dax walm"" produces ""green green green"" (green is repeated three times).
- ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow"" (yellow is repeated three times).
- ""dax walm zup walm"" produces ""green green green yellow yellow yellow"" (each color is repeated three times).
- ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" produces ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow"" (red is repeated three times, then yellow, blue, and red are given once each, followed by red repeated three times, and finally yellow once).
- ""lug dax walm"" produces ""blue green green green"" (blue is given once, followed by green repeated three times).

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:
Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position or the context in which it is used.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present. Every instance of the word ""dax"" in the input consistently yields ""green"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it seems the occurrences of the nonce word ""wif"" consistently correspond to the color ""red"" in the outputs. Here's how it aligns with each input-output pair provided:

- Input: wif walm dax zup | Output: red red red green yellow
  (""wif"" aligns with the first ""red"")

- Input: lug wif dax zup walm | Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
  (""wif"" aligns with the second ""red"")

- Input: wif | Output: red
  (""wif"" aligns with ""red"")

- Input: wif | Output: red
  (""wif"" aligns with ""red"")

- Input: zup dax walm zup wif | Output: yellow green green green yellow red
  (""wif"" aligns with the last ""red"")

Given the consistency in each case, the rule appears to be as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow"". Every input including ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" appearing in the output at the corresponding position of ""zup"". It does not appear to modify or act on surrounding words, since its presence does not change the translation of other words (like ""wif"", ""bluf"", ""dax"", and ""lug"" consistently translating to ""red"", ""blue"", ""green"", and ""blue"" respectively).

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to replicate the color associated with the word that precedes it. Here are the observations:

Example 1: ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" translates to ""green green red yellow green,"" where bluf takes the color of the preceding word ""dax,"" which is green.

Example 2: ""zup dax bluf"" yields ""yellow green green,"" where bluf again matches the color of the preceding word ""dax"" (green).

Example 3: ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red,"" with bluf matching ""wif"" (red).

Example 4: ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green,"" where bluf matches the color of the preceding word ""wif"" (red), and there is no color change indicated for ""walm,"" suggesting that ""walm"" possibly repeats the last color mentioned (green).

Example 5: ""zup bluf dax"" gives ""yellow yellow green,"" where bluf copies the color of ""zup"" (yellow).

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it replicates the color of the word that directly precedes it.

Rule: 
bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word. If the preceding word is ""dax,"" then bluf is green. If the preceding word is ""wif,"" bluf is red. If the preceding word is ""zup,"" bluf is yellow.
To decipher the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the input-output pairings focusing on the instances where ""walm"" is present and scrutinize the colors that follow it.

- In the first example, ""lug walm dax"" becomes ""blue blue blue green."" Since ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""walm"" in this context results in a repetition of the color ""blue"" before changing to ""green.""
- In the second example, ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow."" Using previous knowledge, ""wif"" becomes ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" ""walm"" here again results in a repetition of the ""red"" before shifting to ""green.""
- In the third example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" Since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" repeats the ""yellow"" color.
- The fourth example, ""lug walm zup wif,"" turns into ""blue blue blue yellow red."" Here ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" is ""red."" Again, ""walm"" leads to repeating the color for ""lug.""
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" becomes ""blue blue blue red blue blue."" Following the established meanings, ""lut"" and ""bluf"" mean ""blue,"" and ""wif"" means ""red."" ""Walm"" again seems to repeat the color until a new color term appears.

Based on these observations, ""walm"" appears to cause a repetition of the color of the word immediately preceding it until a different color word is said.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word until a new color word appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Rule:

To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" we must look for patterns in the provided examples that consistently associate with the appearance of ""lug."" Here are the patterns observed:

1. When ""lug"" appears alone, the output is ""blue.""
2. When ""lug"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the output is ""red blue.""
3. When ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output sequence includes three ""blue.""
4. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" results in ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red,"" but here we need to focus only on ""lug"" to find its meaning.

Based on the above observations, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the word ""blue."" The presence of other words alongside ""lug"" affect the output colors, signifying that those other words have their own meanings and potentially modify the output. However, regardless of the surrounding words, ""lug"" always results in ""blue"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:
lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. The other words (""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""wif"") are paired with different colors (""yellow,"" ""blue,"" ""red""), but ""dax"" always results in ""green."" Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green
wif -> red. Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" irrespective of its context within a string of words.
Based on the examples provided:

Input: zup
Output: yellow

- Here, ""zup"" translates directly to ""yellow"".

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", ""wif"" translates to ""red"", ""dax"" translates to ""green"", and ""walm"" does not appear to correspond to a color. As ""zup"" is followed by two additional ""yellow"" outputs, it may indicate that following words, if not corresponding to other colors, are assumed to be ""yellow"".

Input: zup dax
Output: yellow green

- This further supports that ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""dax"" is ""green"" with no indication of any further rule affecting ""zup"".

Input: lug zup
Output: blue yellow

- This demonstrates ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""zup"" maintains its translation as ""yellow"".

Input: dax zup lug wif lug
Output: green yellow blue red blue

- ""dax"" is ""green"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", and ""wif"" is ""red"".

Therefore, the consistent output for ""zup"" across all examples is ""yellow"" with no apparent alternative rule affecting its translation. The rule induced from these examples is:

Rule: zup -> yellow. ""Zup"" consistently means ""yellow"".
Based on the provided examples, it appears that 'bluf' translates to 'red' when preceded by 'wif,' but translates to 'blue' when preceded by 'lug.' There is one instance where 'bluf' follows 'dax' and 'zup,' in this case translating to 'green' and 'yellow' respectively. However, when it follows 'zup' alone, it translates to 'yellow.' 

To summarize the patterns:

1. wif + bluf -> red
2. lug + bluf -> blue
3. dax + bluf -> green
4. zup + bluf (with no 'lug' or 'dax' in between) -> yellow

Given the pattern is not fully consistent especially for the 'zup + bluf' case, a rule-based on these examples might be:

Rule: 'bluf' translates to a color that appears to be dependent on the preceding word, which might act as a color modifier or indicator.
walm -> the color of the word that precedes it. Rule: Walm takes on the color of the preceding word and repeats that color three times. If the preceding word is 'wif', it outputs 'red red red'; if 'bluf', it outputs 'green green green'; if 'dax', 'green green green'; if 'lug', 'blue blue blue'; if there's a 'zup' after 'walm', add 'yellow' to the sequence. 

Thus, 'walm' appears to function as a duplicator of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it, with some situational variation if followed by 'zup'.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"". Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> meaning: ""green""

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" When ""dax"" is an input, the output is ""green."" When paired with ""lug,"" which corresponds to the color ""blue,"" the output is a combination of both colors: ""blue green.""
Based on the examples provided, it can be seen that:

1. 'wif' consistently corresponds to the output 'red.'
2. The output 'red' does not appear to depend on the position of 'wif' in the input, as 'wif' always results in 'red' whether it's at the beginning, middle, or end of the sequence.
3. The other words ('lug', 'walm', 'zup', 'dax', 'bluf') translate to different colors ('blue', 'blue', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue'), but 'wif' only translates to one color, which is 'red'.

None of these other words change the output for 'wif,' which suggests that 'wif' has a consistent and independent meaning, unaffected by its surrounding context within these examples.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, each example contains the nonce word ""zup"" followed or preceded by other words, and the output is a series of colors. By looking at the positions of the word ""zup"" and the corresponding colors in the output, we can try to deduce the meaning of ""zup.""

In every example, whenever the word ""zup"" appears, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output:

- ""zup dax wif zup"" -> ""yellow green red yellow"" (the first and last ""zup"" correspond to ""yellow"")
- ""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red"" (the ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"")
- ""zup bluf lug dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow blue green blue"" (the first ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""; it's noteworthy that ""bluf"" occurs between two ""zup"" words and corresponds to another ""yellow"" in the output)
- ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow"" (the ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"")
- ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" -> ""red yellow yellow red green"" (the ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"")

Given this pattern, we can determine that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input or the surrounding context.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Given the examples, here is the rule for the word ""bluf"":

wif bluf dax -> red red green
wif walm lug bluf -> red red red blue blue
lug bluf dax lug -> blue blue green blue
wif bluf -> red red
lug dax bluf -> blue green green

From these examples, we can induce that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" following ""wif"" and ""blue"" following ""lug."" When ""bluf"" appears after ""wif,"" its output is red, and when it appears after ""lug,"" the output is blue. It does not seem to have an output when paired with ""dax,"" rather ""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green.""

Rule: bluf -> ""red"" when preceded by ""wif"" and ""blue"" when preceded by ""lug"".
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in each input-output pair.

1. In the first example, the output of ""zup wif walm lug"" is ""yellow red red red blue"". We can see that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""wif"" to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"". Since ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""lug"" and the output is ""red red"", we might infer that ""walm"" is also ""red"". But we need to check other examples to confirm this.

2. The second input, ""lug walm wif lug"", results in ""blue blue blue red blue"". Here, we again see the same pattern with ""lug"" and ""blue"", ""wif"" and ""red"". Since there are two instances of ""blue"" before ""red"" this time, the position of ""walm"" preceding ""wif"" seems to result in ""blue"".

3. In the third example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"", generates ""red red green green red red red blue red"". The word ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""dax"" is not repeated, but it corresponds to ""green"" in other examples. Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" which is ""blue"", and preceded by ""wif"" which is ""red"". We have red before and blue after, but ""walm"" is ""red"" in the output again.

4. The fourth example, ""zup dax lug walm zup"", turns into ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow"". Here, ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" which is ""blue"" and is followed by ""zup"" which is ""yellow"". The color corresponding to ""walm"" here is ""blue"" again.

5. Finally, the fifth example, ""zup lug walm wif dax"", becomes ""yellow blue blue blue red green"". Again, ""walm"" is surrounded by ""lug"" and ""wif"", corresponding to ""blue"" and ""red"" in the output.

From these examples, we can see that regardless of the surrounding words, ""walm"" consistently results in the output ""blue"". Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" always corresponds to ""blue"", regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> blue.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,168
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input string.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""dax"" appears to correspond with the output ""green."" Each time ""dax"" is present in the input, the word ""green"" is present in the corresponding position in the output. Following this pattern:

""dax wif dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green red green yellow yellow,"" where ""dax"" appears twice and ""green"" also appears twice in the corresponding output positions.

""dax bluf"" results in ""green green,"" with ""dax"" translating to ""green"" and ""bluf"" seemingly also translating to ""green.""

""dax zup"" yields ""green yellow,"" where ""dax"" is the first word and translates to ""green,"" while ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

""wif zup dax"" provides the sequence ""red yellow green,"" where the final word ""dax"" corresponds to the final output ""green.""

""zup bluf dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow green blue,"" with ""dax"" once again corresponding to the output ""green.""

Thus, the rule is:
dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

- In the first example, 'wif' corresponds to 'red' when it comes after a sequence of alternating 'zup' and 'bluf'.
- In the second example, 'wif' appears after 'dax' and corresponds to 'red' alone, but it is followed by 'walm', which is 'red red'.
- In the third example, 'wif' is the only word and translates directly to 'red'.
- In the fourth example, 'wif' appears before 'zup' and 'dax' and corresponds to 'red'. 
- In the fifth example, 'wif' appears after 'dax' and corresponds to 'red red'.

In all examples, regardless of the position and the surrounding words, the word 'wif' consistently translates to 'red'. Thus, we can conclude that the word 'wif' does not depend on context and consistently means 'red'.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' translates to the color yellow in each provided example.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns in the given input and output examples:

1. ""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green""
2. ""zup dax bluf"" -> ""yellow green green""
3. ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow green yellow green red red""
4. ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red""
5. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""

Looking at the context in which ""bluf"" appears, and the corresponding outputs, we can observe that:

- ""bluf"" is always followed by a color that has already appeared earlier in the input.
- The color after ""bluf"" is always repeated twice in the output.
- The repeated color seems to match with the color of the word immediately preceding ""bluf.""

From the given examples, we can deduce the following pattern:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Given this information, ""bluf"" appears to be a rule which dictates that the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""bluf"" should be repeated two times in the output.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning is that the color designation of the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" is to be repeated twice in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at each instance where it occurs and the corresponding output. Here are all instances extracted:

1. zup wif dax walm lug -> yellow red green green green blue
2. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green
3. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
4. wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue
5. zup dax lug walm zup -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow

Let's analyze:

- In example 1, the sequence ""walm lug"" results in ""green blue.""
- In example 2, ""lug walm dax"" results in ""blue blue green.""
- In example 3, ""zup walm dax"" within a longer sequence results in ""yellow yellow green.""
- In example 4, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue.""
- In example 5, ""lug walm zup"" results in ""blue blue yellow.""

To derive the rule, we notice that ""walm"" is consistently followed by colors easily associated with the previous word. The occurrences of ""walm"" are all followed by repeating the color associated with the word just before ""walm."" Here is the rule based on the associations:

- In example 1, ""dax"" is associated with green and followed by ""walm,"" producing an additional ""green.""
- In example 2, ""lug,"" which is associated with blue, is immediately followed by ""walm"" and then an additional ""blue"" is produced.
- In example 3, ""zup"" is associated with yellow, followed by ""walm,"" and another ""yellow"" appears in the output.
- In example 4, ""lug"" again results in ""blue,"" followed by ""walm,"" and an extra ""blue.""
- In example 5, ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" which results in two occurrences of ""blue,"" and ""zup"" is followed by a ""yellow.""

Thus, we can conclude that the word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated in the output sequence. The number of repetitions may vary, possibly based on other contextual factors beyond the given examples.

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm
    ",Output: blue blue blue,blue blue blue,True,169
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in every given example.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Every instance where ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" is the output.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's look at the outputs associated with each input and identify any patterns.

In each example where ""wif"" appears:
1. ""wif dax zup"" -> ""red green yellow""
2. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
3. ""dax bluf wif lug"" -> ""green green red blue""
4. ""dax walm wif zup"" -> ""green green green red yellow""
5. ""wif"" -> ""red""

If we look at the position where ""wif"" appears and the corresponding color in the output, we can attempt to infer the pattern:
- Whenever ""wif"" is first, the output color is ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is in the second position, the color just before it is also ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is in the third position, it still corresponds to ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is by itself, the output is ""red.""

So ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other words. Thus, the rule can deduced as:

Rule: wif -> ""red""
Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the examples provided, every time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" consistently, regardless of its position in the sequence. Here is the breakdown of how ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" in each example:

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green
- ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red"" in the output.

Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green
- ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""blue"" and fourth ""yellow"" here, but the color which represents ""bluf"" should be the same in both instances because it's the same input word. Hence, it would be more accurate to say ""bluf"" consistently represents ""red,"" and the corresponding output color of ""bluf"" is misprinted in this sequence.

Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow
- ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red"" in the output.

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red
- ""bluf"" corresponds to the third ""red"" in the output.

Input: dax bluf wif lug
Output: green green red blue
- ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""green"" in the output. Here ""green"" would seem to be the correct output for ""dax,"" and ""bluf"" once again translates to ""red.""

Bluf -> meaning. Based on the above examples, the most consistent translation of the word ""bluf"" within the given context is ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> red
Rule: ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the previous noun in the sequence three times.

Examples:
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" so ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" so ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue.""
- Following the same pattern, ""wif walm lug bluf"" translates to ""red red red blue blue.""
- Lastly, ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" translates to ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow.""

Therefore:
walm -> repeat the color of the preceding noun three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Here is the deduction:

- In example 2, ""lug"" is the only input and ""blue"" is the only output, which directly suggests that ""lug"" means ""blue.""

- In examples 1 and 3, ""lug dax"" consistently results in ""blue green."" As ""lug"" appears before ""green"" in the output sequence both times, it's reasonable to assume that ""lug"" correlates with ""blue.""

- Example 5, ""lug wif dax wif"" yields ""blue red green red."" Here ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" at the beginning of the sequence. ""Dax"" appears to consistently correspond to ""green"" (from example 1, 3), and ""wif"" to ""red"" (from examples 4 and 5).

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""lug"" is as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, where the word ""dax"" corresponds to a specific output regardless of its position or the other words around it:

- In the first example, ""dax"" appears after ""zup lug zup"" and translates to ""green"" while ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" is ""blue"".
- The second and fourth examples show ""dax"" on its own, both producing the output ""green"".
- In the third example, ""wif dax"" turns into ""red green"", indicating that ""wif"" likely corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" still translates to ""green"".
- In the fifth example, ""dax zup walm wif"" becomes ""green yellow yellow yellow red"". Here, ""zup"" is consistent with ""yellow"", ""wif"" is consistent with ""red"", and ""walm"" has not been seen separately but likely translates to ""yellow"" given that ""dax"" is consistent with ""green"".

This consistent translation of ""dax"" to ""green"" across different contexts allows us to deduce that:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, ""wif"" appears to correspond to the output ""red."" When ""wif"" is immediately followed by another word (as in ""wif walm"" or ""wif bluf""), it outputs a red for ""wif"" and then repeats red for each of the syllables in the following word (e.g., ""walm"" which has one syllable continues to a single ""red"" and ""bluf"" which has one syllable also corresponds to one ""red"").

So, taking each instance:

- ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red"" indicates that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to a single ""red"", and ""walm"" to ""red red red"" (because it appears to be a three-syllable word or has three elements that lead to repeating ""red"").
- ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red"" indicates ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""wif walm"" follows the previous rule.
- ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red"" again, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" gives one ""red,"" and ""bluf"" adds another ""red.""
- ""zup bluf wif bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow red red"" here, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" and ""wif bluf"" follows the pattern with ""red red.""
- ""wif"" -> ""red"" shows that when ""wif"" is standalone, it corresponds to a single ""red.""

From the provided data, it is also notable that the output for ""wif"" is invariant, it always correlates to ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the words that appear with it.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for what ""bluf"" represents can be deduced as follows:

1. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
2. lug bluf wif -> blue blue red
3. dax lug wif bluf -> green blue red red
4. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
5. zup bluf -> yellow yellow

In every instance, the word ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the input word that immediately precedes it. In other words, the output color for ""bluf"" is the same as the output color for the word right before it.

Rule: bluf -> ""bluf"" represents a repeat of the color of the word before it in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" acts as a repetition signal for the color that precedes it. Here's the deduced rule applied to the given examples:

In the first example, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and the presence of ""walm"" right after it results in ""blue blue blue."" This rule continues with ""zup"" translating to ""yellow,"" so ""walm zup"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow."" Lastly, ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

In the second example, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and following it, ""walm zup walm"" results in ""green green green yellow yellow yellow.""

In the third example, since ""lug"" stands for ""blue,"" ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue.""

In the fourth example, ""lug walm dax"" is translated into ""blue blue blue green"" as ""lug walm"" gives ""blue blue blue,"" and ""dax"" provides the ""green.""

In the fifth example, there's ""lug wif walm,"" and since ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" the ""walm"" following it repeats the ""red"" color to produce ""red red red.""

Rule: walm -> repeats the color denoted by the immediately preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Each instance of the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
Based on the examples provided:

1. Whenever the word ""dax"" appears immediately following another word, it seems to double the color associated with the previously mentioned word.

    - ""lug dax"" resulted in ""blue green green""
    - ""wif dax"" resulted in ""red green green""
    - ""wif dax wif"" resulted in ""red green red""

2. When the word ""dax"" stands alone, the color ""green"" is produced, as indicated by the input ""dax"" and output ""green.""

3. ""dax"" seems to also have the effect of adding an additional ""green"" to the sequence beyond just doubling the color that comes before it, wherever ""dax"" is used. This is inferred because the outputs always have one more ""green"" than the previous color when ""dax"" is used.

Therefore, based on the examples the rule is:

Rule: The word ""dax"" doubles the color associated with the previous word and adds an extra ""green,"" or if ""dax"" stands alone, it signifies ""green.""
Given the examples provided, it is reasonable to deduce that the nonce word ""wif"" stands for the color red. In all instances, when the word ""wif"" is present in the input, the word ""red"" is present in the corresponding output.

Here is the explicit mapping from the examples:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" appears to correspond to ""blue"" (though it is only present in one example)
- ""lug"" does not have a direct correlation, but since ""bluf lug zup"" results in ""red blue yellow,"" we can infer ""lug"" might not change the color output.

So, the rule for ""wif"" is:
wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red,"" except when it immediately follows the word ""zup,"" in which case it is translated to ""yellow."" Thus, the general rule seems to be that ""bluf"" usually means ""red,"" but context can change its meaning.

Rule:
- bluf -> red (default meaning)
- zup bluf -> yellow (context-dependent meaning where ""bluf"" follows ""zup"")
To figure out the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the context it appears in and the corresponding outputs.

1. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" translates to ""blue red yellow red red red."" 
2. ""lug walm zup walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow.""
3. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" translates to ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow.""
4. ""dax walm zup walm"" translates to ""green green green yellow yellow yellow.""
5. ""lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue.""

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" results in repeating the color that corresponds to the word just before ""walm"" three times. More examples might be needed to fully confirm this rule, but with the data provided, it is a reasonable interpretation. Thus, we can state the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the corresponding color of the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it translates to ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green"", regardless of its position within the input sequence or the words around it. The other words, ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""walm,"" lead to different color outputs, but ""dax"" is always associated with ""green."" Given this pattern, we can infer the following rule:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""zup"" seems to correspond to the color ""yellow."" Each instance of ""zup"" in the input correlates with ""yellow"" in the output. Here’s how the correlation works:

- In the first example, ""zup"" is the third word in the sequence and corresponds to the third color in the output sequence, which is ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" is the fourth word and aligns with the fifth color, which is ""yellow,"" suggesting that the rule may involve some positional aspect or that another word not shown in the example may impact the sequence. It is not clear why there's a discrepancy between the position of ""zup"" and the position of ""yellow"" in this particular example.
- In the third example, ""zup"" is the first word and aligns with the first color, ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" is again the first word and corresponds to ""yellow.""

Other words in the examples also exhibit consistent correlations to colors: ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" and ""wif"" correlates with ""red."" The word ""walm"" has not appeared in a position that can isolate its meaning, but since it corresponds to ""red"" in different positions, it might be safe to assume it means ""red,"" too. ""Bluf"" appears once and corresponds to ""yellow,"" but since that position is occupied by ""zup,"" the color ""yellow"" in other examples, the word ""bluf"" could either also mean ""yellow"" or be a special rule that can be used interchangeably with ""zup.""

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the provided examples, it appears as though the word ""bluf"" translates to the color associated with the word that proceeds it. Here's a breakdown matching the inputs and outputs:

- In the first example, ""zup dax bluf zup dax"" leads to ""yellow green green yellow green."" Here, ""bluf"" is placed after ""dax,"" which correlates with green, appearing twice.

- In the second example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow."" ""Bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which correlates with yellow.

- In the third example, ""wif bluf lug"" becomes ""red red blue,"" with ""bluf"" following ""wif,"" leading to red.

- In the fourth example, ""dax bluf wif lug"" gives us ""green green red blue."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" resulting in green.

- Finally, in the fifth example, ""zup bluf dax"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow green."" Again, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which correlates with yellow.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes on the color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the previous word.
Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" translates to repeating the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" three times.

Explanation:

1. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"": Here, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and is represented by the color ""yellow"". Therefore, the rule indicates that we repeat ""yellow"" three times because of ""walm"".

2. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" -> ""green green green yellow blue blue blue"": The word ""dax"" which translates to ""green"" comes before the first ""walm"", resulting in ""green"" being repeated three times. Later, after ""zup"" which translates to ""yellow"", and before the second ""walm"", ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", so ""blue"" is repeated three times after ""lug walm"".

3. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"": The word ""zup"" is directly before ""walm"", so ""yellow"" is repeated three times after ""zup walm"".

4. ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"": The word ""lug"" comes before the ""walm"" which means ""blue"" will be repeated three times after ""lug walm"".

5. ""dax walm wif walm zup"" -> ""green green green red red red yellow"": The first ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which is ""green"", so ""green"" is repeated three times. The second ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which is ""red"", so ""red"" is repeated three times. There is no ""walm"" after ""zup"", so ""yellow"" is simply translated once at the end.

Therefore, the rule is:
walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
Based on the given examples, it appears that each word corresponds to a specific color. By analyzing the examples and comparing the inputs to the outputs, we can deduce the meaning of ""dax.""

Example analysis:

- ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red blue green green."" The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" ""bluf"" is new and not repeated, but based on its position in the sequence, we can infer that it likely corresponds to ""green."" This leaves ""dax"" also corresponding to ""green.""

- In ""dax walm,"" only ""dax"" and ""walm"" are present, and the output is ""green green green."" We can deduce that both ""dax"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""green.""

- ""dax walm wif"" corresponds to ""green green green red,"" which further confirms that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and both ""dax"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""green.""

- ""dax zup wif zup"" produces ""green yellow red yellow."" Here, we see ""dax"" at the start corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" in the middle corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" appears to correspond to ""yellow.""

- ""wif lug dax walm"" yields ""red blue green green green,"" so ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and since ""dax"" and ""walm"" are followed by ""green,"" this supports the idea that both correspond to ""green.""

Based on this analysis, the rule for ""dax"" is:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, it appears that whenever the word ""wif"" is present, the output always contains the word ""red."" Here is the correspondence for each example provided:

- ""lug zup wif"" corresponds to ""blue yellow red"".
- ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" corresponds to ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"".
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- ""lug dax wif"" corresponds to ""blue green red"".
- ""dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green red red"".

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look at the examples and their corresponding outputs to find a pattern.

1. ""dax walm wif zup"" → ""green green green red yellow""
2. ""zup lug zup wif dax"" → ""yellow blue yellow red green""
3. ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" → ""green blue yellow red red green""
4. ""wif zup"" → ""red yellow""
5. ""zup dax"" → ""yellow green""

Looking at the sequences, we can see that each time ""zup"" occurs, the corresponding output is ""yellow."" It consistently follows this pattern regardless of its position in the input sequence. We'll test this observation with each example:

- In the first sequence, ""zup"" is the last word and is mapped to ""yellow.""
- In the second sequence, ""zup"" appears first and third, both times mapped to ""yellow.""
- In the third sequence, ""zup"" appears again and is mapped to ""yellow.""
- In the fourth sequence, ""zup"" is the second word and results in ""yellow.""
- In the fifth sequence, ""zup"" is the first word and again results in ""yellow.""

So the rule seems to be consistent across these examples, which gives us:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow"" 

This suggests that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the provided contexts.
bluf -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word. Rule: The word 'bluf' causes the preceding color word to be repeated. For instance, 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', so 'lug bluf' results in 'blue blue'. Similarly, 'wif' corresponds to 'red', hence 'wif bluf' translates to 'red red', and 'zup' is associated with 'yellow', making 'zup bluf' become 'yellow yellow'. The pattern continues regardless of the sequence, as demonstrated in the provided examples.
walm -> meaning. Rule: The word walm seems to correspond to a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it, repeated three times. For instance, 'dax' is associated with the color green, so 'dax walm' results in 'green green green'. Similarly, 'lug' is associated with blue, hence 'lug walm' results in 'blue blue blue'. In the last example, 'wif' is associated with red, so 'wif walm' yields 'red red red'.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug
    ",Output: red blue,red blue,True,174
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Each unique word before ""lug"" corresponds to a unique color. For example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
Rule: dax -> green

In each example:

- Whenever the word ""dax"" is mentioned, the output is always ""green.""
- Other words in the inputs correlate to other specific colors consistently (lug -> blue, walm -> green, etc.).

Thus, within the context of these examples, ""dax"" means ""green.""
Observing the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of ""wif."" 

- In examples where ""wif"" is present, the output always starts with ""red.""
- It appears that the rest of the output corresponds to colors associated with the other words, suggesting that each word has a color mapping. ""Lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""
- The output maintains the order of colors according to the order of words in the input.

Based on this, the word ""wif"" could be associated with the color ""red."" This idea is consistently supported by the fact that every input containing ""wif"" has an output starting with ""red.""

Rule: 

wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to a specific color in the output. Each example demonstrates that the presence of the word ""zup"" results in the word ""yellow"" in the output.

Here are the specific instances from the examples:
- In the first input, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and ""wif,"" which result in ""yellow"" before ""red"" and ""green"" respectively.
- In the second input, ""zup"" appears before ""lug"" and ""walm,"" and again before ""wif"" and ""bluf,"" and in each case, it results in ""yellow"" in the output before the colors corresponding to those words.
- In the third input, ""zup"" appears after ""walm"" and before ""wif,"" which correlates to ""yellow"" after ""blue"" and before ""red"" in the output.
- The fourth input shows ""zup"" following ""wif"" and preceding ""dax,"" corresponding to ""yellow"" before ""green"" in the output.
- In the fifth input, the pattern of ""dax zup dax zup wif"" corresponds to ""green yellow green yellow red,"" reaffirming the association of ""zup"" with ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we'll examine its repeated occurrence and the corresponding output:

1. In the second input, ""wif bluf lug zup"" corresponds to ""red red blue yellow,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" equals ""red"" since ""wif"" is consistently mapping to ""red"" and ""lug"" is mapping to ""blue"".
   
2. However, this does not hold true for the first input: ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" produces ""red green red red yellow red,"" where ""bluf"" also follows ""wif"" but the output is two consecutive ""red.""

3. In the third input, ""dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green red red,"" where ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""bluf"" again produces a ""red"" subsequent to a ""red"" from ""wif.""

4. In the fourth input, ""dax lug bluf dax"" maps to ""green blue blue green."" Here, ""bluf"" is between ""lug"" which is ""blue"" and ""dax"" which is ""green,"" and it outputs ""blue,"" matching the color of ""lug.""

5. In the last input, ""dax walm wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green green green red red,"" where ""bluf"" follows a sequence of ""green"" and results in ""red,"" breaking the sequence.

Based on the above analysis, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that ""bluf"" outputs the same color as the immediately preceding color unless the preceding color is ""red."" If the preceding color is ""red,"" then ""bluf"" outputs ""red"" regardless of the prior color sequence. This rule is consistent across all the provided examples.

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color of the preceding word, but if the preceding color is ""red,"" then bluf is also ""red.""
To determine the meaning of 'walm', we'll compare the inputs to the outputs closely to see the relationship between the words and the colors. Let's examine each input/output pair where 'walm' occurs and see if we can deduce a pattern.

Input 1: dax lug walm zup wif    
Output 1: green blue blue blue yellow red

Input 2: dax walm zup lug dax    
Output 2: green green green yellow blue green

Input 3: lug wif dax walm zup    
Output 3: blue red green green green yellow

Input 4: zup bluf wif walm    
Output 4: yellow yellow red red red

Input 5: lug walm wif zup wif    
Output 5: blue blue blue red yellow red

From these inputs and outputs, 'walm' seems to result in a pattern where the word 'walm' produces the same color as the word that precedes it; if 'walm' is the first word, then it would follow the color of the last word that was not 'walm'. For example:

- In Input 1, 'walm' follows 'lug' and 'lug' corresponds to blue in Output 1.
- In Input 2, 'walm' follows 'dax' and 'dax' corresponds to green in Output 2.
- In Input 3, 'walm' follows 'dax' and 'dax' corresponds to green in Output 3.
- In Input 4, 'walm' follows 'wif' and 'wif' corresponds to red in Output 4.
- In Input 5, 'walm' follows 'lug' and 'lug' corresponds to blue in Output 5.

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the word immediately before it in the sequence. If 'walm' is the first word, it takes the color of the last non-'walm' word in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm
    ",Output: green green,green green green,False,175
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"" in the provided examples.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" The presence of the word ""lug"" corresponds to the word ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""blue."" The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" When ""wif"" appears alongside these other nonce words, its corresponding output “red” is still present and precedes the colors associated with the other words.

Thus, the most straightforward rule for the nonce word ""wif"" seems to be:

Rule: ""wif"" -> ""red""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. When ""zup"" is paired with another word, the output includes yellow and an additional color based on the other word. For instance, ""wif"" results in red, and ""lug"" results in blue. 

When ""zup"" is placed before another nonce word, ""yellow"" precedes the color associated with that word. When ""zup"" comes after the nonce word, ""yellow"" follows the color associated with that word. When ""zup"" is alone, only the color yellow is in the output.

Therefore, the rule can be defined as follows:

zup -> yellow

Rule: When ""zup"" accompanies an identified color word, ""yellow"" will be listed in the sequence where ""zup"" is relative to that word (before or after). If ""zup"" is alone, the output is ""yellow."" If ""zup"" is followed by an unidentified nonce word, it will default to yellow for each nonce word without a previously demonstrated color association.
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word. 

In the given examples, the word immediately before ""bluf"" is repeated in the output as a color. ""Dax"" translates to ""green,"" and when followed by ""bluf,"" ""green"" is repeated. Similarly, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" which is also repeated following ""bluf"". ""Wif"" translates to ""red,"" and is again repeated when followed by ""bluf"". Therefore, ""bluf"" triggers the repetition of the color associated with the word that comes before it.
Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" appears to replicate the color of the word preceding it multiple times in the output. The number of times the color is repeated seems to be the same as the number of letters in the word following ""walm"". Here's the breakdown of the pattern observed:

1. wif walm lug bluf -> red red red blue blue
   ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (which translates to red) and is followed by ""lug"" (which translates to blue). Since ""lug"" has three letters, ""walm"" produces three reds.

2. lug walm -> blue blue blue
   ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and isn't followed by any word; it outputs three blues, corresponding to the three letters in ""lug"".

3. wif walm -> red red red
   ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) and isn't followed by any word; it outputs three reds, corresponding to the three letters in ""wif"".

4. dax walm wif zup -> green green green red yellow
   ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) and is followed by ""wif"" (red). Since ""wif"" contains three letters, ""walm"" produces three greens.

5. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
   ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" (blue) and follows ""dax"" (green). Since ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and there's no word after ""walm"", it outputs three blues corresponding to the three letters in ""lug"".

Rule:
walm -> meaning: Replicates the color of the word preceding it, producing a number of repetitions equal to the number of letters in the word following it. If there's no word following ""walm,"" the color repetition is based on the preceding word's count.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color blue.
Rule: dax -> green

Each instance of the input word ""dax"" corresponds to the output color ""green"". The output does not appear to change based on the position of ""dax"" within the sequence, indicating that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green,"" irrespective of context within these examples.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" has a consistent meaning across different contexts: it is always translated to the color ""red."" Each instance of ""wif"" in the output is represented by the color ""red."" There are no examples indicating that the meaning of ""wif"" changes dependent on context or position.

Thus, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red
Meaning: ""wif"" means the color red regardless of its position or surrounding words.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow. In each instance where ""zup"" is used, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output. When ""zup"" is combined with another word, the output is a combination of yellow and another color. It seems that ""zup"" does not change its meaning based on context; it consistently translates to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, `bluf` seems to correspond to the color that is mentioned after `bluf` in the Output. To confirm this, let's analyze each example:

1. Input: zup bluf dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow green blue
    - `bluf` precedes the output color green, but is followed by the output color blue.

2. Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif -> Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
    - `bluf` precedes the output color blue twice.

3. Input: dax zup bluf -> Output: green yellow yellow
    - `bluf` precedes the output color yellow.

4. Input: wif dax bluf -> Output: red green green
    - `bluf` precedes the output color green.

5. Input: wif bluf lug zup -> Output: red red blue yellow
    - `bluf` precedes the output color red, but is followed by the output color blue.

Looking at these examples, the rule seems to be that `bluf` translates to the color that follows its occurrence in the input. However, there is some inconsistency as seen in example 1, where `bluf` is followed by `dax` (which corresponds to green) but the output is blue.

Given the examples (and assuming there might be an error in the first example), the most consistent rule that can be induced is:

bluf -> the color that follows its occurrence in the input, according to the color sequence defined by the other words (zup, lug, dax, and wif).

Rule: If ""bluf"" is followed by another nonce word whose color we know, then ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that follows it.
Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" appears to correspond to a color that repeats itself a number of times dependent on a specific condition. It is noticeable that ""walm"" produces a sequence of the same color, and the number of repetitions matches the position of ""walm"" within the input sequence. Here are the observations:

1. ""lug wif dax walm zup"" -> ""blue red green green green yellow""
   ""walm"" leads to ""green"" repeated three times because ""walm"" is the fourth word.

2. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
   ""walm"" leads to ""blue"" repeated two times because ""walm"" is the second word.

3. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""
   ""walm"" leads to ""green"" repeated three times because ""walm"" is the fourth word.

4. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red""
   ""walm"" leads to ""yellow"" repeated two times because ""walm"" is the second word.

5. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red""
   ""walm"" leads to ""red"" repeated three times because ""walm"" is the fourth word.

From these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the output color to be the color corresponding to the word that appeared immediately before ""walm"" and repeats that color as many times as the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence. For example, if ""walm"" is the second word, the color before it repeats twice; if ""walm"" is the fourth word, the color repeats four times, and so on.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word, as many times as the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
From the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. This can be deduced by looking at each instance where ""lug"" appears in the input and noting that ""blue"" is the color in the corresponding position in the output.

Here's how ""lug"" correlates to ""blue"" in each example:

- In the first example, ""lug"" appears before ""zup"" which corresponds to ""red blue yellow"".
- In the second example, ""lug"" is followed by ""bluf"" and they both result in ""blue blue"" in the output.
- The third example features just ""lug bluf"", and the output is ""blue blue"", further suggesting that ""lug"" equates to ""blue"".
- The fourth example contains ""lug"" between ""dax"" and ""zup"", leading to ""green blue yellow"" in the output.
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" comes after ""wif"" and the color sequence is ""red blue"".

No other context-dependent rule can be deduced for ""lug"" from the given examples.

Thus, the rule is:
lug -> blue
From the given examples, we can infer a pattern for the word 'dax' and its associated color output:

1. Input: wif dax → Output: red green
2. Input: zup lug zup dax → Output: yellow blue yellow green
3. Input: dax lug dax lug walm → Output: green blue green blue blue blue
4. Input: dax zup wif → Output: green yellow red
5. Input: zup dax → Output: yellow green

In all instances, regardless of the context, the word 'dax' corresponds directly to the color green in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs, looking for patterns associated with the use of the word ""wif.""

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow
- Here, ""wif"" is followed by ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""red yellow.""

Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
- In this case, ""wif"" is followed by ""lug"" and ""walm"" which correspond to ""red blue"" and ""red yellow yellow yellow"" respectively, with ""lug"" matching ""blue"" as well. 

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
- ""wif"" is before ""walm"" and corresponds to ""red red red"" after ""yellow yellow red.""

Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
- ""wif"" occurs at the end, and it corresponds to the final ""red.""

Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green
- ""wif"" is followed by ""dax"" and ""bluf"" which correspond to ""red green green.""

From these observations, it appears that ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red."" Whenever we see ""wif,"" the sequence of colors that follow immediately after begin with ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red

Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in an input sequence, the output sequence starts with the color ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be quite straightforward:

Rule: zup -> yellow

Each time the word 'zup' is encountered in the input, the corresponding output is 'yellow'.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that is named before it. Here is the breakdown:

1. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"": bluf follows ""zup,"" which translates to yellow.
2. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"": the word before bluf is ""wif,"" which translates to red, resulting in ""red red.""
3. ""dax bluf zup bluf dax"": the first bluf follows ""dax"" which is green, and the second bluf follows ""zup"" which is yellow.
4. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"": bluf follows ""dax,"" which translates to green.
5. ""lug bluf dax lug"" -> ""blue blue green blue"": bluf follows ""lug,"" which translates to blue.

Rule: bluf repeats the color mentioned directly before it.

bluf -> meaning: bluf repeats the color mentioned before it.
Observing the provided examples, we can notice a pattern where the word ""walm"" directly affects the output. Here's what we can deduce:

1. The presence of ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"", which is a sequence of three greens regardless of the word ""dax"" translating to ""green"" once.

2. With ""lug wif dax zup walm"", we get ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow"". Here ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". However, after ""dax zup walm"", we notice a sequence of three yellows instead of ""green yellow"".

3. In ""dax zup walm wif"", the output sequence is ""green yellow yellow yellow red"". Again, ""walm"" is followed by three instances of the color corresponding to the word prior to ""walm"" (""zup"" translates to ""yellow""), and ""wif"" afterwards turns into ""red"".

4. ""zup wif walm lug"" turns into ""yellow red red red blue"". It's visible that ""walm"" is followed by three ""red""s, which corresponds to ""wif"" just before ""walm"".

5. Finally, ""dax walm wif dax""'s output is ""green green green red green"", where ""walm"" is followed by ""green"" thrice, corresponding to the color for ""dax"" before ""walm"".

From these examples, we can derive the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" translates to three repetitions of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it.

Hence, the definition is:

walm -> A rule that generates three consecutive instances of the color represented by the word that comes directly before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,178
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can see that when ""lug"" appears in a sequence, the word that follows ""lug"" generates a color in the output that is not generated by ""lug"" when it is the final word. The color that does follow ""lug"" when it is not the final word (i.e., when it's followed by another word in the input), is ""blue."" 

For instance, when ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" we have ""blue blue blue"" in the output, but when ""lug"" stands alone, the output color is ""blue."" In the cases where ""lug"" is preceded by ""dax"" or another word, the color green precedes ""blue,"" which is the color for ""lug,"" but ""dax"" itself independently corresponds to ""green.""

This consistency allows us to infer that ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
From analyzing the given examples, it seems that each nonce word corresponds to a particular color. Following is the observed pattern:

- The word ""wif"" always corresponds to the output ""red.""
- The word ""bluf"" always corresponds to the output ""red.""
- The word ""lug"" always corresponds to the output ""blue.""
- The word ""zup"" always corresponds to the output ""yellow.""
- The word ""dax"" always corresponds to the output ""green.""
- The word ""walm"" is seen once and corresponds to the output ""blue.""

Therefore, based on the provided examples, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the given examples, we can infer the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" by comparing the inputs to the outputs. 

1. When ""wif"" appears before ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red.""
2. ""Bluf"" by itself, or after ""zup,"" produces the output ""yellow yellow.""
3. After ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" ""bluf"" produces ""yellow.""

The rule seems to be that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it, as indicated by the colors in the output. If ""bluf"" is the first word or no specific word precedes it, the default color appears to be ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the word immediately before it, defaults to yellow if there is no preceding word.
By analyzing the given examples, we can induce the following rules for the nonce word ""walm"":

1. When ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"" with no other words in between, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue."" 
   - This suggests that ""lug"" might mean ""blue"" and ""walm"" also means ""blue"" repeating as many times as the other color words that follow ""walm.""
   
2. ""lug wif walm"" translates to ""blue red red red."" 
   - Since ""lug"" appears to mean ""blue,"" and the presence of ""wif"" once results in the color ""red"" being repeated three times, ""walm"" seems to cause the color before it to be repeated according to some pattern.

3. ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue.""
   - Here, ""zup"" precedes ""wif,"" yielding ""yellow,"" and the same repetition pattern of ""red"" is observed for ""wif"" before ""walm."" ""lug"" at the end brings back the ""blue.""

4. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" translates to ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow.""
   - In this case, ""wif"" and ""lug"" in between ""zup""s produce ""yellow red blue"" accordingly. Then, we see that the word ""zup"" followed by ""walm"" results in the ""yellow"" color being repeated three times.

From these observations, we can deduct that ""walm"" causes the color word that appears just before it to repeat three times. If multiple colors are mentioned before ""walm"" without interruption, only the immediate predecessor color word to ""walm"" is affected.

Rule:
walm -> The color word immediately preceding ""walm"" is repeated three times. If ""walm"" is the first word or if the immediate word preceding it is not a color word, ""walm"" translates to ""blue"" repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Every time ""lug"" is mentioned, the output is ""blue.""
dax -> green

Rule: The term ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Other words in the input correspond to different colors, such as ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"".
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow each time it appears. The other words seem to correspond to different colors: ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""dax"" to green, and ""wif"" to red.

Rule:
zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, ""bluf"" appears to repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. Here are the observed patterns:

- dax => green; bluf immediately after dax => green (green green)
- zup => yellow; bluf immediately after zup => yellow (yellow yellow)
- wif => red; bluf immediately after wif => red (red red)
- In sequences, ""bluf"" keeps repeating the color of the word prior to it (wif dax zup wif dax bluf yields red green yellow red green green)
- When ""bluf"" comes after lug, the output is blue, suggesting that ""lug"" corresponds to blue (lug bluf wif => blue blue red)

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the correlation between the input and output in each example by looking at the positioning and repetition of colors in the output associated with the word ""walm.""

Input: zup wif dax walm
Output: yellow red green green green
- Here, ""walm"" results in three greens following the color that corresponds to ""dax.""

Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
- ""Walm"" precedes the final ""lug"" and results in three reds, suggesting that the color before ""walm"" is repeated three times.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""Walm"" follows ""zup"" and results in three yellows, again reinforcing that it causes the preceding color to be repeated three times.

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
- ""Walm"" is between ""lug"" and ""zup,"" and it results in three blues, linking it to ""lug.""

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
- ""Walm"" is at the end, after ""zup,"" and results in three yellows following the yellow associated with ""zup.""

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, it results in the color associated with the immediately preceding word being repeated three times in the output.

Thus:
walm -> the preceding color is repeated three times

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

When the word 'dax' appears in the input, it consistently translates to 'green' in the output.

Therefore, the rule induced from the examples is that the nonce word 'dax' means 'green'.
The examples provided show a consistent pattern in the output colors associated with the word ""wif"" and any words that follow it. Each unique word following ""wif"" is assigned a specific color. The word ""wif"" itself always results in the output ""red"".

Here is the pattern based on the given examples:

- ""wif"" on its own always results in ""red"".
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""zup"", ""walm"", ""dax"", or ""lug"", each of these words corresponds to a different color: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". The same word following ""wif"" always results in the same color.

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" based on the examples provided seems to be associated with the output color ""red"" and it acts as a starting signal for translating subsequent words into their respective colors.

Rule: ""wif"" -> ""red"". It signifies the beginning of a sequence where each unique word is translated to a specific color, starting with ""red"" for ""wif"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the outputs provided.
Considering the provided examples, we can make the following observations:

1. ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup"" translates to ""yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow"".
2. ""wif bluf lug zup"" translates to ""red red blue yellow"".
3. ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"".
4. ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red"".
5. ""zup dax bluf"" translates to ""yellow green green"".

From these examples, we can deduce the following pattern:

- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"", the output is ""red red"".
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"", the output is ""green green"".
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"", the output is ""yellow yellow"".
- ""bluf"" alone doesn't have an output, implying it's meaning is based on the word preceding it.

Together, these observations suggest that ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word that comes before it.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""bluf"" means to repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before it in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. For example:

- In ""zup bluf wif walm"", the word before ""walm"" is ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"", and so ""walm"" produces two additional ""red"" outputs.
- In ""zup walm"", ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"", thus ""walm"" produces two more ""yellow"" outputs.
- In ""dax walm wif"", ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which corresponds to ""green"", thus ""walm"" repeats ""green"" twice, but does not affect the subsequent ""wif"" which produces ""red"".
- In ""zup bluf lug zup walm"", ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"", thus ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times, as there is another ""zup"" before ""bluf"".
- In ""lug walm"", ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which corresponds to ""blue"", thus ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" twice.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color output of the word that precedes it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"". In each example where ""lug"" appears, the output includes the color ""blue"".
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. No other context or variation is provided that suggests an alternative rule or meaning. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, we can infer that ""bluf"" generates repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. Each input example ends with ""bluf"" and the output demonstrates a duplication of the color word that is associated prior to ""bluf."" Therefore, we can postulate the following rule:

bluf -> repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Examples supporting the rule:
- ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" results in ""green red yellow yellow red red red,"" where ""yellow"" is repeated because ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which is associated with ""yellow.""
- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red,"" indicating that ""bluf"" means to repeat the color ""red,"" which is associated with ""wif.""
- ""zup wif bluf"" gives ""yellow red red,"" so ""bluf"" doubles the ""red"" associated with ""wif.""
- ""wif walm lug bluf"" leads to ""red red red blue blue,"" suggesting ""bluf"" has caused ""blue,"" which is the color associated with ""lug,"" to be repeated.
- ""dax zup bluf"" results in ""green yellow yellow,"" again showing that ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the previous word, in this case ""yellow"" associated with ""zup.""

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.
walm -> ""repeat the color corresponding to the word just before it, three times""

Rule: When the word ""walm"" appears after another word, it means to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times. For instance:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" since ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, which is then repeated three times due to ""walm"".
- ""wif lug walm"" leads to ""red blue blue blue"" because ""wif"" is for red, ""lug"" is for blue, and ""walm"" dictates that the color right before it (blue) should be repeated three times.
- ""zup wif walm lug"" turns into ""yellow red red red blue"" with ""zup"" as yellow, ""wif"" as red (repeated three times because of ""walm""), and ""lug"" as blue.
- ""dax wif walm"" creates ""green red red red"" with ""dax"" as green, ""wif"" as red, and the threefold repetition due to ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue, regardless of its position in the sequence.
dax -> green

Rule: Whenever the nonce word ""dax"" is encountered, it corresponds to the color green.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's analyze the inputs and outputs given in the examples:

1. `zup wif` -> `yellow red`
2. `lug dax wif lug` -> `blue green red blue`
3. `zup bluf wif dax lug` -> `yellow yellow red green blue`
4. `wif lug dax lug` -> `red blue green blue`
5. `zup wif` -> `yellow red`

Let's look at the consistency of the outputs with respect to the presence of ""wif"" in the input:

- When ""wif"" appears after ""zup,"" the output always starts with ""yellow"" followed by ""red.""
- When ""wif"" appears in the middle of a sequence, for example in Input 3, ""red"" appears in the output between the color translations of the words before and after ""wif.""
- When ""wif"" is the first word in the sequence, the output starts with ""red,"" and the colors corresponding to the words after ""wif"" follow.

Hence, the rule seems to be: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red,"" and it induces the translation of surrounding words into their respective colors without altering the order of those translations.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow. Each time ""zup"" is present in the input, ""yellow"" is present in the output at the same position relative to the other words. Therefore, we can deduce that the meaning of ""zup"" is the color yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color of the word that follows it. When ""bluf"" is the last word in the input, it defaults to the color ""yellow"". Here is how the rule applies to the examples provided:

- Input: dax lug bluf dax -> Output: green blue blue green (bluf translates to ""blue,"" which is the color word 'dax' following it.)
- Input: wif bluf dax lug -> Output: red red green blue (bluf translates to ""green,"" which is the color word 'dax' following it.)
- Input: dax bluf wif zup lug -> Output: green green red yellow blue (bluf translates to ""red,"" which is the color word 'wif' following it.)
- Input: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup -> Output: blue blue red blue blue yellow (bluf translates to ""red,"" the color of 'wif' and then ""yellow"" as it is the last word.)
- Input: dax zup bluf -> Output: green yellow yellow (with no following word, bluf defaults to the color ""yellow"".)

Rule: bluf -> the color of the following word; if it is the last word, ""yellow""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" represents the repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Each occurrence of ""walm"" results in the color of the preceding word being outputted multiple times. The specific number of times the color is repeated appears consistently tied to the word before ""walm"":

- ""zup dax walm"" outputs ""yellow green green green,"" which suggests ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""dax"" (green) three times.

- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue,"" which suggests ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""lug"" (blue) three times.

- ""zup lug walm wif walm"" outputs ""yellow blue blue blue red red red,"" which suggests ""walm"" after ""lug"" repeats the color blue three times and ""walm"" after ""wif"" repeats the color red three times.

- ""zup dax lug walm zup"" outputs ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and repeats the associated color (blue) three times.

- ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red,"" which suggests ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""wif"" (red) three times.

So, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color of the preceding word to be outputted three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
From the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

- ""lug bluf dax lug"" corresponds to ""blue blue green blue"". ""Bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". ""Lug"" must therefore correspond to ""blue"" since it is consistent with the outputs when ""lug"" and ""bluf"" appear.
  
- ""lug dax zup"" corresponds to ""blue green yellow"". We already know ""dax"" is ""green"" from the previous example, so ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" is again ""blue"".

- ""lug zup"" corresponds to ""blue yellow"". We know from the previous example that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", so ""lug"" remains ""blue"".

- ""lug wif bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red red"". We know ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" in this instance (note the change from the first example), but since ""lug"" appears before ""bluf"", it still appears to correspond to ""blue"". ""Wif"" seems to correspond to ""red"" here.

- ""dax zup lug wif lug"" corresponds to ""green yellow blue red blue"". We can see ""dax"", ""zup"", and ""wif"" correspond to ""green"", ""yellow"", and ""red"" respectively. ""Lug"" appears twice and both times it corresponds to ""blue"".

Thus, ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue"" in these examples, regardless of the position or other words around it.

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

The examples indicate that every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green."" This is consistent across all examples provided, so the rule can be concluded as: whenever the input contains the word ""dax,"" it translates to the color ""green"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" seems to correspond with the color ""red"". Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. This correspondence holds true regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the series of words or the length of the series.

For other words such as ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""walm,"" they seem to correspond with the colors ""green,"" ""blue,"" ""yellow,"" and ""yellow,"" respectively. The pattern is that each unique word is associated with a unique color.

Hence, the rule can be defined as:

wif -> red

Rule: Each unique word is mapped to a unique color, with ""wif"" specifically mapping to ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Regardless of the other words present or their order, whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should first observe the patterns between inputs and their corresponding outputs. Here are the observations:

1. ""zup bluf lug zup"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue yellow."" The word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow,"" but ""bluf"" yields ""blue"" only in the presence of ""lug"" between ""zup.""

2. ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red."" Here, ""bluf"" yields ""red,"" which is the same as the translation for ""wif.""

3. ""dax bluf zup"" translates to ""green green yellow."" ""dax"" becomes ""green"" and ""bluf"" also translates to ""green"" when it's following ""dax"" but before ""zup.""

4. ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow."" In this sequence, ""bluf"" comes after several instances of ""zup"" and ""lug,"" and it results in ""yellow,"" which is the same as the translation for ""zup.""

5. ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow."" Both ""zup"" and ""bluf"" yield ""yellow"" when they follow ""dax.""

From these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" does not have a consistent translation to a single color on its own; rather, its translation depends on the context—specifically, the word that comes immediately before it. Thus, ""bluf"" seems to take on the color value of the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color value of the preceding word.
From the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times.

Example 1: ""dax walm wif"" leads to ""green green green red."" Here, ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and dax seems to be associated with green, since it is followed by three greens. ""Wif"" comes after ""walm"" and is followed by red, suggesting that ""wif"" is associated with red.

Example 2: ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" is followed by three yellows, suggesting that ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and once again, ""walm"" repeats this color three times.

Example 3: ""dax walm wif walm"" leads to ""green green green red red red."" The word ""walm"" repeats the associated color of ""dax"" and ""wif"" (green and red respectively) three times, with ""walm"" occurring after both words.

Example 4: ""lug walm zup lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" is associated with blue, and ""zup"" is associated with yellow. ""Walm"" repeats the color of the word before it three times.

Example 5: ""dax wif walm"" leads to ""green red red red."" ""Dax"" is associated with green and ""wif"" with red. ""Walm"" repeats the color red, associated with ""wif,"" three times.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the outputs.
Rule: dax -> green

Each input that contains the word ""dax"" has an output with the word ""green"" in the corresponding position.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" always translates to the color ""red"". However, for the other words (""lug"", ""walm"", ""dax"", ""zup""), the examples suggest that each translates to a different color. Here is what we can deduce about the colors for each word:

- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"".
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"".
- ""walm"" consistently translates to ""blue blue blue"" as seen when it is repeated in the output.
- ""dax"" and ""zup"" appear only once each. ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"". 

We can write the rule as follows:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red"". Other words each translate to a specific color or sequence of colors (""lug"" to blue, ""walm"" to blue blue blue, ""dax"" to green, and ""zup"" to yellow). Each occurrence of the word in the input is translated independently to its corresponding color in the output.
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

Rule:
zup -> yellow
These examples show a pattern in which specific words correspond to specific colors. Here's the pattern deduced based on the given examples:

- 'dax' corresponds to the color green.
- 'wif' corresponds to the color red.
- 'lug' corresponds to the color blue.
- 'walm' appears to result in a sequence of the color green.

When we examine instances where 'bluf' appears, we see that it generally results in the same color as the word that immediately precedes it:

- In the second example, 'dax bluf' leads to 'green green', suggesting that 'bluf' takes on the color green after 'dax'.
- In the third example, 'dax bluf wif' leads to 'green green red', where 'bluf' takes on the color green again after 'dax' but does not affect the output of 'wif', which is red.
- In the fourth example, 'lug wif lug bluf' results in 'blue red blue blue', indicating 'bluf' takes on the color blue after 'lug'.
- In the fifth example, 'dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax' outputs 'green blue blue blue green red red green', where 'bluf' follows the color red after 'wif'.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: 'bluf' -> meaning. 'Bluf' takes on the color of the word that comes directly before it.

Based on the examples, ""bluf"" means it takes on the color indicated by the preceding word.
From the given inputs and outputs, it's apparent that ""walm"" corresponds to a repeating pattern of a particular color, based on the color associated with the word that appears just before ""walm"".

Input: zup bluf wif walm
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""wif"" comes right before ""walm"", and ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- The output is ""yellow yellow red red red,"" so ""walm"" after ""wif"" results in repeating ""red"".

Input: lug walm
- ""lug"" comes right before ""walm"" and corresponds to blue.
- The output is ""blue blue blue,"" which means ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in repeating ""blue"".

Input: wif dax zup walm
- ""zup"" comes right before ""walm"" and corresponds to yellow.
- The output is ""red green yellow yellow yellow,"" so ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in repeating ""yellow"".

Based on this pattern, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: walm -> Causes the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup wif zup
    ",Output: yellow red yellow,yellow red yellow,True,185
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" seems consistently associated with the color blue.

For example:
- In ""wif zup lug wif,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In ""lug dax,"" it comes directly before ""green,"" but the inclusion of ""lug"" specifically results in ""blue green,"" again showing ""lug"" produces ""blue.""
- In ""lug walm wif lug,"" the pattern ""blue blue blue red blue"" aligns with ""lug,"" which directly translates to ""blue"" with ""walm"" apparently repeating the previous color, hence ""blue blue blue.""
- ""lug walm"" without ""wif"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" which reaffirms the pattern.
- ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" shows that between two occurrences of ""wif,"" ""lug"" yields ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning or pattern associated with the word ""dax."" Here are the examples again, with an analysis of each:

1. Input: dax lug
   Output: green blue
   
2. Input: dax
   Output: green
   
3. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red
   
4. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow red green red red
   
5. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green

From the examples, we can detect a pattern: whenever the word ""dax"" is mentioned, the output always includes ""green."" This is consistent across all examples given:

- In example 1, ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the output is ""green blue.""
- In example 2, the only input is ""dax,"" and the output is simply ""green.""
- In example 3, ""dax"" is the second word, and ""green"" is the second color in the output.
- In example 4, ""dax"" is the third word, and ""green"" is the third color.
- In example 5, ""dax"" is the first word, and ""green"" is the first color.

Based on this pattern, we can propose a rule for the meaning of ""dax"":

Rule: dax -> green

Whenever ""dax"" is encountered in the input, it corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that:

- ""lug"" consistently maps to the output ""blue"".
- ""dax"" consistently maps to the output ""green"".
- ""walm"" consistently maps to the output ""red"".
- ""bluf"" consistently maps to the output ""yellow"".

The word ""wif"" appears to always result in the output ""red"". To check if there are any other dependencies, we will examine the position of ""wif"" in each input:

- Input: ""wif dax"" -> Output: ""red green"" (Here, ""wif"" is before ""dax"". ""wif"" -> ""red"" and ""dax"" -> ""green"")
- Input: ""wif lug dax"" -> Output: ""red blue green"" (""wif"" precedes the other two words whose outputs are known, and it still results in ""red"")
- Input: ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" -> Output: ""blue red green red blue red"" (In this sequence, we see that ""wif"" results in ""red"" regardless of its position, at the end or in the middle.)
- Input: ""lug bluf wif"" -> Output: ""blue blue red"" (Here, ""wif"" comes last and still results in ""red"".)
- Input: ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow red red red"" (Even though ""zup"" is an unknown and does not map to ""wif"", it seems ""wif"" always maps to ""red"", showing that ""wif"" is independent of ""zup"").

Therefore, it seems that ""wif"" directly translates to the output ""red"" regardless of its position or the surrounding words. Hence the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" The other words in the inputs also correspond to specific color outputs: ""bluf"" to ""red,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The order of the words in the input directly correlates with the order of the colors in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following associations between the nonce words and colors:

- 'dax' appears to consistently correlate with 'green'
- 'wif' appears to consistently correlate with 'red'
- 'lug' appears to consistently correlate with 'blue'
- 'zup' appears to consistently correlate with 'yellow'

For the word 'bluf,' we can observe the following patterns:

- In each output, 'bluf' is associated with a different color.
- The color associated with 'bluf' does not repeat any color that has immediately preceded it in the series.

Given these observations, we can induce a rule that 'bluf' outputs a color that does not repeat the immediately preceding color of the sequence. For instance, when 'bluf' follows 'dax' (green), 'wif' (red), or 'zup' (yellow), the output color for 'bluf' is 'red,' but when it follows 'lug' (blue), the output color is 'yellow'. However, there are two conflicting cases:

- In the second example, 'bluf' follows 'wif' (red) but outputs 'green,' even though 'green' has already been used for 'dax'.
- In the third example, 'bluf' follows 'wif' (red) but outputs 'red red,' resulting in a repetition.

Because of these conflicting cases, we cannot confidently say that 'bluf' always outputs a unique non-repeating color. However, we can still postulate that 'bluf' tends to avoid repeating the immediately preceding color.

Given the limited dataset and the conflicting information, the best induction of rule for 'bluf' that fits most examples is:

bluf -> outputs a color that is not the same as the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, with some exceptions.

Rule: When 'bluf' follows a word, the resulting color is different from the color associated with the preceding word, barring some inconsistencies in the dataset.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" has the effect of repeating the color associated with the word that precedes it two additional times. Here is how that rule fits each input:

- Input: wif walm => Output: red red red (wif translates to one red, and walm repeats it two more times)
- Input: zup lug walm wif dax => Output: yellow blue blue blue red green (lug translates to blue, and walm repeats it two more times; wif and dax are not affected by the previous walm)
- Input: dax walm zup walm => Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow (dax translates to green and walm repeats it two additional times; after zup for yellow, walm repeats it two more times)
- Input: lug walm => Output: blue blue blue (lug translates to blue, and walm repeats it two additional times)
- Input: wif walm zup => Output: red red red yellow (wif translates to red, walm repeats it two more times, zup then translates to yellow)

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,186
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue,"" regardless of the other words present in the input sequence. Other words in the input, like ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" ""dax,"" and ""walm,"" correspond to other colors in the outputs (""wif"" to red, ""zup"" to yellow, ""bluf"" to yellow, ""dax"" to green, and ""walm"" to red). There doesn't appear to be any variation in the outputs associated with ""lug""; it always maps to ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> ""blue""
From the examples provided, it appears that each word corresponds to a color. The input words are translated to specific color outputs. Now, by examining the input and output pairs, we can attempt to determine what the word ""dax"" corresponds to:

1. In every instance where the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
2. Other words such as ""lug,"" ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" and ""wif"" correspond to the colors ""blue,"" ""yellow,"" ""green,"" and ""red,"" respectively. Noticeably, ""bluf"" and ""dax"" both translate to ""green"" in different contexts, indicating that ""dax"" doesn't strictly represent a single color but potentially a context-based rule or meaning.

Upon closer inspection, however, we can see that ""bluf"" always precedes another color (never appearing at the end of a sequence), while ""dax"" only appears in sequences of two or more words and never as the first word in a sequence. This behavior suggests that ""dax"" operates with a rule different from a direct color assignment like the other words.

Considering that ""dax"" differently than ""bluf"" despite both outputting the color ""green."" — we can infer the following rule:

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" but follows a specific condition where it is contextually dependent on the presence of a preceding word. Hence, it is an indicator for ""green"" whenever it is not the initial word in the sequence.

dax -> green (contextually dependent)
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word 'wif' is consistently associated with the output 'red'. When 'wif' appears alone or with other words, the word 'red' is always included in the output. The presence of additional words such as 'zup', 'dax', and 'lug' correlates to the addition of different colors in the output ('yellow', 'green', and 'blue', respectively).

To summarize, the rule appears to be:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever 'wif' is present in the input, include 'red' in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the rule can be deduced as follows:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" results in a repetition of ""blue"" (as seen in ""zup lug walm"" where ""lug"" is followed by ""blue blue blue"")

From the examples, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule:

The word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color that is the same as the color assigned to the word that immediately precedes it.

So for each example:
- dax zup wif bluf lug -> green yellow red red blue
    * ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to red, so ""bluf"" is red.
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow
    * ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow, so ""bluf"" is yellow.
- zup lug bluf zup bluf wif -> yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
    * The first ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to blue, so the first ""bluf"" is blue.
    * The second ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow, so the second ""bluf"" is yellow.
- dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
    * ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow, so ""bluf"" is yellow.
- lug bluf -> blue blue
    * ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to blue, so ""bluf"" is blue.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the color represented by the word directly before it.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" correlates with a repeated sequence of the color red in the output. Specifically, the instances of ""walm"" in the inputs are always followed by a series of three ""red"" in the output:

- In the first example, ""dax lug wif walm"" leads to ""green blue red red red.""
- In the second example, ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" leads to ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow,"" with the sequence of three reds after walm and the rest of the colors following their respective input.
- In the third, fourth, and fifth examples, the appearance of ""walm"" also consistently results in three ""red"" in the output.

It is important to note that the word ""walm"" is always followed by a sequence of three reds regardless of its position within the input string.

Rule: walm -> a sequence of three reds in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup bluf
    ",Output: green yellow yellow,green yellow yellow,True,187
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue in every given example.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's examine the relationship between the input and the output in the provided examples.

1. When ""dax"" is immediately followed by ""bluf,"" the corresponding output is ""green"" adjacent to another color (green for ""bluf"").
- Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green

2. When ""zup"" and ""dax"" are used in the same pattern, the output is ""yellow"" for ""zup"" and ""green"" for ""dax."" Again, ""dax"" followed by ""bluf"" results in ""green"" followed by ""red"" for ""bluf.""
- Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf -> Output: yellow green yellow green red red

3. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" In this example, ""dax"" follows ""bluf,"" and the pattern holds: ""dax"" produces ""green.""
- Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf -> Output: blue red red green blue blue

4. In a succession without ""bluf"" following ""dax,"" the output is still ""green,"" suggesting that the presence of ""bluf"" is not necessary for ""dax"" to correspond to ""green.""
- Input: zup dax lug dax -> Output: yellow green blue green

5. Here, ""dax"" appears alone after ""lug,"" and it still maps to ""green.""
- Input: lug dax -> Output: blue green

Based on these observations, we can induce that ""dax,"" independent of the context within the given examples, correlates directly to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that:

- Each occurrence of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red.""
- Each occurrence of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green.""
- Each occurrence of the word ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that specific nonce words are associated with specific colors in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's compare the outputs corresponding to each input where ""zup"" appears:

1. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
2. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
3. dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow
4. zup bluf lug zup walm -> yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
5. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green

Here are some observations:

- When ""zup"" appears at the beginning of the input sequences (examples 1, 4, and 5), the output always starts with ""yellow.""
- In example 3, ""zup"" is at the end, and the last color in the output is ""yellow.""

From these observations, it seems that regardless of its position in the input sequence, the presence of the word ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output. This correspondence is consistent across all examples provided.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that comes after it when there is a sequence, or it retains the last mentioned color when it concludes the sequence. Let's analyze each input and output pair:

- In the first input, ""lug wif bluf,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""wif"" to red. ""Bluf"" is followed by nothing, so it repeats the last mentioned color, which is red. The result is ""blue red red.""

- In the second input, ""wif bluf dax,"" ""wif"" is red, and ""dax"" is green. ""Bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" (green), so it corresponds to red and then changes to green after ""dax."" The result is ""red red green.""

- In the third input, ""dax lug bluf dax,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""lug"" to blue. ""Bluf"" sits between two occurrences of ""lug"" (blue) and ""dax"" (green). It starts as blue, which comes just before it, and changes to green, which follows it. The result is ""green blue blue green.""

- In the fourth input, ""wif lug zup bluf,"" here ""zup"" is a new word corresponding to yellow. ""Bluf"" is at the end, so it repeats the color mentioned before it, which is yellow. The result is ""red blue yellow yellow.""

- In the fifth input, ""wif zup bluf lug,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" (blue), so it changes from the preceding color, yellow, to blue. The result is ""red yellow yellow blue.""

From this analysis:
bluf -> meaning. Rule: ""Bluf"" adopts the last mentioned color when at the end of a sequence or transitions between the color before it and the color that follows it in the sequence.
walm -> meaning. According to the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of a color based on the word that precedes it.

Rule: 
- If ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" then the output is ""green"" repeated three times.
- If ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" then the output is ""red"" repeated three times.
- If ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" then the output is ""yellow"" repeated once (example 1) or there are no repetitions for ""zup"" (example 4 could be assumed to repeat ""blue"" from the word ""lug"" to fill three terms, as ""zup"" doesn't seem to have a threefold repetition for the output). 
- However, there is an inconsistency with ""zup"" since it only provided a single ""yellow"" in the first input but did not provide any color in the fourth input, therefore, the rule for ""zup"" is not clear based on the given data.

Additionally, the word that comes after ""walm"" does not influence the output associated with ""walm."" It seems the output color is solely based on the word immediately before ""walm."" Furthermore, it can be derived that ""lug"" results in ""blue blue blue"" and ""dax"" still results in ""green green green,"" even if it comes after ""walm.""

Lastly, the number of repetitions may be dependent on the word preceding ""walm,"" with most examples indicating three repetitions ('dax' and 'wif' lead to three repetitions), while 'zup' has inconsistent repetition. This inconsistency requires more data to establish a clear pattern for 'zup.' 

Final Rule:
- ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, most of the time thrice. The specific color depends on the preceding word, with known associations for ""dax"" (green) and ""wif"" (red), and a potential association of ""lug"" (blue) assuming ""lug"" precedes ""walm."" The association with ""zup"" needs more clarification.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

    ",Output: red green red,red green red,True,188
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
From the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of ""dax"" by looking at the corresponding outputs. Here is what we see:

1. ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" -> ""green green red yellow red""
   Here ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

2. ""zup dax walm zup wif"" -> ""yellow green green green yellow red""
   In this sequence, ""dax"" appears after ""zup"" (which corresponds to ""yellow"") and corresponds to ""green"" again.

3. ""dax zup dax zup"" -> ""green yellow green yellow""
   Both instances of ""dax"" correspond to ""green"".

4. ""dax walm zup lug"" -> ""green green green yellow blue""
   ""dax"" at the start corresponds to ""green"".

5. ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" -> ""green blue blue blue green red red green""
   All instances of ""dax"" correspond to ""green"", regardless of their position or the words around them.

Based on the outputs, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"" in the color sequence. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: dax -> green
Analyzing the provided examples, the goal is to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif."" To do this, we look for patterns regarding the appearance of ""wif"" and the associated outputs.

Example Analysis:

1. Input: ""wif lug"" -> Output: ""red blue""
   Here, the input ""wif"" is followed by ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""red blue"" in the output.

2. Input: ""wif walm lug bluf"" -> Output: ""red red red blue blue""
   In this instance, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm lug bluf,"" and it appears that ""wif"" could mean ""red,"" as each word after ""wif"" translates to a color – ""walm"" seems to produce ""red,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" to ""blue"" as well, consistent with the ""lug"" output in the first example.

3. Input: ""lug wif bluf lug wif"" -> Output: ""blue red red blue red""
   This aligns with the previous inference that ""wif"" could mean ""red"" because it is preceded and followed by terms that correspond to an alternating pattern, with ""lug"" consistently translating to ""blue.""

4. Input: ""zup wif lug"" -> Output: ""yellow red blue""
   Here, ""zup"" appears to translate to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" once again seems to correspond to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

5. Input: ""wif dax wif"" -> Output: ""red green red""
   The appearance of ""wif"" at both the beginning and the end of the sequence and their corresponding ""red"" output in the beginning and the end of the result sequence strengthens the idea that ""wif"" is translated into ""red."" ""Dax"" in the middle corresponds to ""green.""

Given the above examples and the consistency of ""wif"" with ""red"" in the output, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""wif"" -> ""red""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow."" Every time ""zup"" appears in an input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output. Here are the relations based on the examples given:

1. ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" -> ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue""
    Every ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".

2. ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
    The single word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

3. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
    ""zup"" once again corresponds to ""yellow"". The sequence ""zup walm"" produces only ""yellow yellow"".

4. ""wif zup"" -> ""red yellow""
    ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" regardless of preceding words like ""wif"".

5. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
    ""walm"" after ""zup"" doesn't maintain its original color but becomes ""yellow"" after ""zup"".

Based on these observations, the rule can be formulated as follows:

Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"". Furthermore, ""zup"" potentially changes the meaning of the word that immediately follows it, as seen in example 3, where ""walm"" might normally mean ""blue"", but when preceded by ""zup"", it results in ""yellow"".

Therefore:

zup -> ""yellow"" (and potentially modifies the color meaning of the word that follows it to ""yellow"")
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" like this:

1. In the first example, ""lug bluf wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue red"". The word ""bluf"" is between ""lug"" and ""wif"", which correspond to ""blue"" and ""red"" respectively. Since one of the output colors is repeated and there's only one ""bluf"" it is not clear yet what ""bluf"" might mean.

2. In the second example, ""lug walm wif bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue red red"". Here, ""walm"" precedes both ""bluf"" and ""wif"" and is followed by two occurrences of ""blue"" in the output, suggesting ""walm"" might mean ""blue"". ""Bluf"" follows ""wif"" in the sequence with ""red"" following ""bluf"" in the output, indicating that ""bluf"" likely means ""red"".

3. The third example, ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf,"" which corresponds to ""red green yellow red green green,"" does not include the word ""lug"" for blue, suggesting that ""bluf"" cannot mean ""blue"" in this context. Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", which corresponds to ""green"", leading us to believe ""bluf"" might mean ""green"" here.

4. In the fourth example, ""wif bluf dax lug"" corresponds to ""red red green blue"". Since ""lug"" is already known to mean ""blue"" and appears last in the sequence, and ""dax"" has been seen to represent ""green"", it stands to reason that ""bluf"" here represents ""red"" as it is output right after a ""wif"" which also corresponds to ""red"".

5. In the fifth example, ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" corresponds to ""blue red green green red blue"". Similar to the second example, we see ""blue"" and ""red"" at the beginning and end, matching ""lug"" and ""wif"" respectively. ""Dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" and both are followed by ""green"" in the output, further supporting that ""dax"" is ""green"". ""Bluf"" in this context is followed by ""green"" once again, so we cannot conclude with certainty that ""bluf"" is ""red"" here as it does not precede a ""red"" in the output as it did in the second and fourth examples.

After analyzing each instance, ""bluf"" seems to correspond to ""red"" or ""green"" depending on its position relative to other known words like ""wif"", ""dax"", and ""lug"". However, in none of the examples ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"". 

Given these observations, it seems ""bluf"" might conditionally mean ""red"" or ""green"" depending on the context. However, given the mixed evidence particularly in the third example, the rule is still ambiguous.

Therefore, our tentative rule is:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> meaning is context-dependent; it likely means ""red"" when appearing after ""wif"", and ""green"" when following ""dax"", although further examples would be needed to confirm this rule without ambiguity.
Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" seems to correlate with a repetition of a color word three times. Each input that is not ""walm"" has a single corresponding color in the output.

Here's the relationship between the inputs (non-""walm"" words) and outputs (colors):
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- wif -> red

When ""walm"" appears in the input, the color associated with the word immediately preceding it is repeated three times in the output.

From the data:

- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue""
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red""

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: When the word ""walm"" is used, it indicates to repeat the color associated with the word prior to ""walm"" three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it. Here is the rule induction:

- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""walm"" is not directly translated to a color in any of the samples, but considering the pattern, one instance of ""walm"" translates to two instances of ""green""

Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" is:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it seems that 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red.' Each time the word 'wif' is present in the input, the word 'red' appears in the corresponding position in the output. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
By examining the inputs and corresponding outputs, we can deduce the following about the word 'zup':

In all input instances where the word 'zup' is present, the output always contains the color 'green', except in cases where 'zup' is either at the beginning or the end of the input sequence. In those cases, 'zup' corresponds to the output color 'yellow'.

From the examples, 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', 'dax' to 'green', and 'walm' to 'green'. Whenever 'zup' is surrounded by these words, it also corresponds to 'green'. However, when 'zup' stands alone or is at the beginning or the end of a sequence, it corresponds to 'yellow'.

Based on this observation, the rule we can induce for the nonce word 'zup' is as follows:

Rule: If 'zup' is immediately followed by another word, or is situated between two words, it translates to 'green'. If 'zup' is at the beginning or end of an input sequence, or stands alone, it translates to 'yellow'.

Therefore, zup -> If between other words, then 'green'; if at the beginning/end or alone, then 'yellow'.
bluf -> repetition of the color word preceding it.

Rule: If a color word comes before ""bluf,"" the output should repeat that color word as many times as ""bluf"" signifies. For instance, ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" causes the color ""blue"" to repeat once (thereby producing two instances of ""blue""). Similarly, ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow."" The context of ""lug wif bluf"" where ""lug"" is blue, ""wif"" is red, and the output is ""blue red red,"" suggests that ""bluf"" can also apply to a sequence of colors, repeating them in the same order. However, the given examples are not sufficient to conclusively determine the exact pattern of repetition when multiple colors are involved. Further examples would be needed to fully understand the rule in such cases.
Rule: walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the last word mentioned before walm three times. 

For example:
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue, hence ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"".
- ""dax"" corresponds to green, hence ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"".
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, so ""zup walm"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow"". When it is combined with ""wif"" which corresponds to red, ""zup walm wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow red"".
- In sequences with multiple color words followed by ""walm,"" such as ""lug wif dax zup walm,"" the output is the sequence of corresponding colors followed by the color of the last word before ""walm"" repeated three times, which in this case is ""yellow,"" so the output is ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow"".
- Similarly, ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" leads to a sequence of the corresponding colors ending with ""yellow"" repeated three times, resulting in ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif zup dax
    ",Output: green red green green,green red yellow green,False,190
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue irrespective of its position in the sequence.
From the examples provided, we can make the following observations:

1. When the word ""dax"" appears, the output is always green.
2. The word ""walm"" also results in green, but only when it follows a ""dax"".
3. The word ""zup"" correlates with yellow except when it is followed by ""dax"", in which case the word after ""dax"" (which is ""walm"") becomes green.
4. The words ""wif"" and ""bluf"" both correlate with red.

Now, let's attempt to deduce the rule for ""dax"" and ""walm"" since ""walm"" only becomes green after ""dax"". It's possible that ""dax"" could be a modifier that affects following words, but there is no instance of ""dax"" being followed by any other words except ""walm"" and ""zup"", and when it is followed by ""zup"" it seems to pass its green property to the next word rather than the ""zup"" itself.

Rule: ""dax"" directly translates to ""green"". Additionally, when ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"", the sequence ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"", which is one green for ""dax"" and two greens for ""walm"". This rule may suggest that ""dax"" doubles the effect (or the number of ""green"" in the output) of the word following it if that word would normally yield one ""green."" However, with this limited data set, this rule is only speculative and would need more examples to be confirmed. As there is no conflict in the provided information, the most straightforward rule we can induce is that ""dax"" translates directly to ""green."" 

dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to look for patterns in the examples provided. Let's break down each example and see how ""wif"" influences the output:

1. ""wif walm dax"" -> ""red red red green""
2. ""zup dax zup wif"" -> ""yellow green yellow red""
3. ""lug dax wif"" -> ""blue green red""
4. ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue""
5. ""wif zup"" -> ""red yellow""

From these examples, we can observe that whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""red."" There is no variation in the output for ""wif"" despite different contexts or positions within the input string.

Based on this consistent pattern, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look at the relationship between the inputs and the outputs:

1. ""dax zup"" -> ""green yellow""
2. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
3. ""dax zup"" -> ""green yellow"" (repeat of example 1)
4. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
5. ""wif zup"" -> ""red yellow""

In every output, the presence of the word ""zup"" corresponds with the color ""yellow"" in the list of colors. No other word in the inputs consistently corresponds to ""yellow."" Therefore, it seems that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" 

The outputs are consistent in that each word in the input results in a color in the output. The word ""dax"" corresponds with the color ""green,"" the word ""wif"" corresponds with the color ""red,"" and the additional colors after ""zup"" in the second and fourth examples correlate with the additional words ""walm"" and ""bluf"" in the inputs.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to take on the color value of the word immediately preceding it. Here is the analysis based on each input-output pair:

1. ""zup dax bluf"" -> ""yellow green green""
   Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which is associated with ""green"", so ""bluf"" outputs ""green"".

2. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
   ""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" which is associated with ""yellow"", so ""bluf"" outputs ""yellow"".

3. ""zup dax bluf zup dax"" -> ""yellow green green yellow green""
   The first ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and outputs ""green"". No second ""bluf"" is present so it just repeats the pattern of ""zup"" and ""dax"".

4. ""wif bluf dax"" -> ""red red green""
   ""Bluf"" follows ""wif"" which is associated with ""red"", therefore ""bluf"" outputs ""red"".

5. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
   ""Bluf"" follows ""dax"" and hence takes on the color ""green"".

To summarize, it appears that the rule for ""bluf"" is that it replicates the color associated with the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color value of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the provided input-output pairs and identify any patterns or consistencies that can be observed:

1. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

2. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

3. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

5. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

From these patterns, we can observe that:

- After ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""
- After ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""
- After ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow.""
- After ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""

Every time the word ""walm"" appears in the input, in the output immediately following it there are three identical colors. Specifically:

- In the first input, after ""walm,"" there are three consecutive ""blue"" in the output.
- In the second input, after ""walm,"" there are three consecutive ""yellow"" in the output.
- In the third input, after ""walm,"" there are again three consecutive ""red"" in the output.
- In the fourth input, similar to the third, after ""walm,"" there are three consecutive ""red"" in the output.
- In the fifth input, after ""walm,"" there are three consecutive ""yellow"" in the output.

Given the consistency across the examples, we can determine a rule for what ""walm"" means:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the following word to be repeated three times in the output color sequence corresponding to its rule (lug -> blue, dax -> green, zup -> yellow, wif -> red).

Walm -> meaning: When ""walm"" appears in the input, the color word that follows immediately after ""walm"" is translated into its corresponding color and is then repeated three times in succession.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug dax wif walm
    ",Output: red blue green red red red red,red blue green red red red,False,191
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. 

Rule: The word lug translates to the color blue regardless of its position or context within a string of words.
Given the examples, the rule appears to be related to the position of the word ""dax"" within the input sequence and the corresponding color output in the same position in the output sequence. Here are the outputs for ""dax"" specifically in each input:

1. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
2. wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> red green red red yellow red
3. dax wif -> green red
4. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
5. dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> green blue yellow red red green

In each case where ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output color is ""green."" Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" in this context appears to be that it consistently correlates with the output color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the input-output examples provided, we can observe the following pattern:

Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

It appears that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"" as well. The word ""wif"" appears between ""lug"" and ""walm"" and ""zup"" and ""walm"" and is followed by the color ""red.""

Input: wif dax
Output: red green

Here ""wif"" is followed by ""red,"" and ""dax"" is followed by ""green.""

Input: zup wif lug dax
Output: yellow red blue green

Again, ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow,"" ""wif"" by ""red,"" ""lug"" by ""blue,"" and ""dax"" by ""green.""

Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green

Here ""wif"" precedes ""red,"" ""dax"" is followed by ""green,"" and ""bluf"" is also followed by ""green.""

Input: wif
Output: red

Here, ""wif"" alone corresponds to ""red.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

wif -> red

This rule indicates that in all cases, regardless of context, the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Hence, the meaning of ""wif"" in the examples provided is consistently the color ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the rule that governs the meaning of the nonce word 'zup.' Let's look at the data available:

Input: zup walm dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow green
- 'walm' corresponds to multiple yellows, and 'dax' corresponds to green.

Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
- 'lug' seems to correspond to blue, occurring twice and matching the output. 'bluf' produces a yellow.

Input: wif zup lug zup lug
Output: red yellow blue yellow blue
- 'wif' corresponds to red, 'lug' to blue, and when 'zup' is between them, it corresponds to yellow.

Input: dax zup
Output: green yellow
- 'dax' corresponds to green, followed by 'zup' as yellow.

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
- 'bluf' followed by 'wif' here results in two yellows, and a series of reds.

From these observations, it's clear that 'zup' consistently corresponds to the output 'yellow,' irrespective of its position or the context provided by surrounding words.

Rule: zup -> yellow. 'Zup' corresponds to the color yellow.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word directly preceding it. 

- In the first two examples, ""dax"" is associated with green and ""lug"" with blue. When followed by ""bluf,"" the output is the repeated color of the preceding word. 

- In the third example, the pattern holds for instances like ""lug bluf,"" where ""lug"" is associated with blue and the output is ""blue blue."" 

- In the fourth example, the instance ""wif bluf"" has ""wif"" associated with red, and the output following ""bluf"" is again red.

- The same rule applies to the fifth example.

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.
Analyzing the input and output pairs, a pattern appears where the output correlates to specific words in the input. The word 'walm' seems to be associated with a color in the output, and the presence of other words (such as 'wif', 'zup', 'lug', 'dax') dictate other specific colors.

From the given examples:

- Whenever 'wif' appears in the input, the output is 'red red red'.
- When 'zup' is present, the output is 'yellow' for every instance.
- 'lug' correlates with 'blue' in the output.
- 'dax' when coupled with 'wif' gives 'red green' but since there's no instance of 'dax' without 'wif', it's difficult to determine if 'dax' contributes to 'green' or is it a combination of 'wif dax'.

Now, let's focus on 'walm':

1. 'wif walm dax' results in 'red red red green'. Here 'wif' is contributing three 'red', but the fourth color is 'green', which seems to be related to 'walm' since 'dax' is presumably represented by 'red' as well when combined with 'wif'.
   
2. 'zup walm' results in 'yellow yellow yellow'. In this case, we know 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', but there's one extra 'yellow' that is likely associated with 'walm'.
   
3. 'lug zup walm lug' results in 'blue yellow yellow yellow blue'. Here, 'lug' appears twice which corresponds to the two 'blue' outputs at the beginning and end. 'zup' leads to 'yellow', and the sequential 'yellow's suggest 'walm' contributes to one 'yellow'.
   
4. 'wif walm zup walm' gives 'red red red yellow yellow yellow'. The pattern from previous examples suggests 'walm' is adding 'yellow' to the sequence here.

5. 'zup lug walm wif dax' results in 'yellow blue blue blue red green'. This line provides a strong indication that 'walm' corresponds to 'blue': 'zup' is related to 'yellow', 'lug' to 'blue', and 'wif' to 'red', with 'dax' potentially adding 'green' to the 'red' contributed by 'wif'.

Based on the repeated occurrences and correlations, it seems that 'walm' is consistently linked with an additional color in the output sequence, with the only variable in the first example, where it is linked to 'green'. But, given that 'dax' only appears with 'wif' and we cannot be sure of its standalone output, we can hypothesize that 'walm' might have multiple outputs depending on the context, or it can be an indicator for the next word's color in the sequence (for example, determining 'green' in 'red red red green').

However, as 'dax' only appears with 'wif', and the ambiguity persists because of the fixed association, we cannot conclude decisively about the specific meaning of 'walm' with the evidence given. There is not enough information to determine a consistent rule for 'walm' without further examples. 

Rule: 

The rule for 'walm' cannot be conclusively determined. It seems to indicate an additional color in the output, which might depend on the words that surround it, but further examples are needed to establish a definitive meaning or rule for 'walm'.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf lug zup walm lug

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" is consistently translated into the color ""green"". Therefore, we can deduce that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Each of the other words seem to correspond to a unique color as well: ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".

The rules appear as follows:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> green
- zup -> yellow

Rule: Each nonce word is associated with a specific color in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" directly corresponds to the color ""red.""

Here is the mapping from the examples:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output at the respective position. ""Wif"" does not seem to change meaning based on its position in the sequence, it consistently translates to ""red.""

Therefore, the rule is: 

wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following associations:

- lug -> blue
- walm -> yellow (since it's repeated for ""yellow yellow yellow"")
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- bluf -> yellow (since it appears as a replacement for ""zup"" without altering the sequence of ""yellow"")

Given these associations, every time ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow."" Therefore, in this context, ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" appears to correspond to the color that is repeated in each output. 

- In the first example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" which would mean ""bluf"" equals ""yellow.""

- In the second example, ""zup lug bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue blue red."" Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue,"" as it is ""lug"" that stands for ""blue.""

- In the third example, ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax"" translates to ""red red yellow red blue green."" Since ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" we can see that the second instance of ""wif"" did not repeat the color red in the third slot, indicating that ""wif"" does not follow the rule applied to ""bluf."" Thus ""bluf"" here is the repeated ""red"" after ""wif.""

- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" indicating again that ""bluf"" equals ""red.""

- In the fifth example, ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red green red red."" Here, since ""bluf"" comes after a second ""wif,"" it translates to ""red"" again, which matches the pattern.

This suggests that ""bluf"" represents the color of the word directly preceding it. It is a kind of repeater for the previous color.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the word that comes immediately before ""bluf.""
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following rule related to the nonce word ""walm"":

- In every output sequence, the presence of ""walm"" corresponds to multiple instances of the color that precedes it. 

Let's analyze the examples to support this rule:

1. Input: ""wif bluf dax walm""
   Output: ""red red green green green""
   ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to the color green. ""walm"" results in three greens in a row.

2. Input: ""zup walm lug""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow blue""
   ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to the color yellow. ""walm"" results in three yellows in a row.

3. Input: ""wif zup walm dax zup""
   Output: ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow""
   ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" corresponding to yellow. ""walm"" results in three yellows in a row.

4. Input: ""zup wif walm""
   Output: ""yellow red red red""
   ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" corresponding to red. ""walm"" results in three reds in a row.

5. Input: ""lug wif walm""
   Output: ""blue red red red""
   ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" corresponding to red. ""walm"" results in three reds in a row.

Therefore, the induction rule is:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output to triple the color that is represented by the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

So we can say:

walm -> Triple the preceding color's output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of ""lug"" by looking at the patterns and the corresponding outputs.

In all examples, whenever the word ""lug"" is present in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output. 

- Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
  Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
  - Here, ""lug"" at the end corresponds to ""blue.""

- Input: lug wif bluf
  Output: blue red red
  - The first word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

- Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
  Output: yellow yellow red blue green
  - ""lug"" is the fourth word, corresponding to the fourth color ""blue.""

- Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
  Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
  - The second and last words are ""lug"" and they correspond to ""blue.""

- Input: wif lug
  Output: red blue
  - Again, ""lug"" is the second word, corresponding to the second color ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
The meaning of ""lug"" is the color blue.
Based on the examples provided, the consistent output corresponding to the input ""dax"" is ""green."" Other words in the input, such as ""wif"" and ""zup,"" correspond to other colors, ""red"" and ""yellow"" respectively, and ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue."" Therefore, the rule appears to be a straightforward mapping of certain nonce words to color names.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" When ""wif"" appears with other words, it adds the color red to the end of the sequence of colors represented by those words. 

The word that precedes ""wif"" appears to determine the sequence of colors preceding red. For example:
- ""lug"" translates to blue, so ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue.""
- ""walm"" translates to ""red red red,"" so ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red red.""
- When ""wif"" is on its own, it produces ""red.""
- The word ""zup"" translates to yellow, therefore ""zup wif"" is ""yellow red"" and ""zup walm wif"" is ""yellow yellow yellow red.""

Rule: wif -> red, with the added context that any word before ""wif"" will dictate the sequence of colors prior to ""red"" based on its own rules.
Based on the examples provided, ""zup"" seems to consistently translate to ""yellow,"" as each output begins with ""yellow"" when the input starts with ""zup."" The second word in the input affects the second color in the output. For instance, ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which suggests that ""walm"" has no direct color translation or ""walm"" repeats the color given by ""zup."" ""Wif"" results in red, and ""lug"" results in blue. 

Rule: zup -> yellow. When followed by another word, ""zup"" outputs ""yellow"" followed by the color corresponding to the next word (if any). ""Walm"" does not correspond to a new color but rather repeats the color given by ""zup.""
Based on the given examples, each instance of ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color output that is duplicated immediately before or after it. Here are the observations to support this:

- In the first example, ""bluf wif"" results in ""yellow red"", with ""red"" being the duplicate of ""wif"".
- In the second example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"", with ""blue"" being the duplicate of ""lug"".
- In the third example, ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"", with ""red"" being the duplicate of ""wif"".
- In the fourth example, ""dax bluf"" yields ""green green"", with ""green"" being the duplicate of ""dax"".
- In the fifth example, ""wif bluf lug"" leads to ""red red blue"", with ""red"" being the duplicate of ""wif"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the nearest word with an already established color. The direction does not matter; what matters is that the established color is duplicated.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> the color of the nearest word with an established color, resulting in a duplication of that color.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to replicate the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here is how the rule applies:

1. ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" translates to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which is blue, hence ""walm"" becomes blue, repeating the color of ""lug.""

2. ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which is red, hence ""walm"" becomes red, repeating the color of ""wif.""

3. ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" Again, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), therefore ""walm"" becomes blue.

4. ""dax lug wif walm"" translates to ""green blue red red red."" In this case, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), so ""walm"" becomes red.

5. ""wif walm dax"" translates to ""red red red green."" Here, ""walm"" is red because it follows ""wif"" (red).

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be:

Rule: walm -> takes on the color of the word that precedes it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the output is ""blue.""
Rule: dax -> green

Explanation: In each example provided, whenever the word ""dax"" is used in the input, the color ""green"" is present in the same position in the output. This consistent one-to-one correspondence suggests that ""dax"" directly translates to ""green.""
Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" can be deduced as follows:

Whenever ""wif"" is mentioned in the input, the output always starts with ""red."" Thus, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" It appears consistently as the first color output. In the case of ""wif"" being followed by another word, an additional color is outputted after ""red,"" which seems to be dependent on the second word. However, with the given inputs, we don't have enough examples to deduce a pattern for each following word.

For the input ""zup wif walm,"" the output starts with ""yellow,"" which suggests that ""zup"" may correspond to ""yellow,"" and the three ""red"" colors following it likely correspond to each syllable in ""wif walm.""

The deduced rule is:
wif -> red.

Meanings for other words or combinations thereof are not fully established with the given data.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"", let's look at each example and identify patterns that might indicate what ""bluf"" corresponds to in the output.

Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow

In this sequence, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""lug"" appears only once and corresponds to ""blue"". Notably, ""bluf"" appears twice and is directly followed by ""blue"" in both instances in the output. This could suggest that ""bluf"" might mean ""repeat the next color"".

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and the sequence repeats ""yellow"" once more after ""bluf"" appears. This supports the initial hypothesis that ""bluf"" might mean ""repeat the next color"".

Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
Output: yellow red green red red

In this example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and when ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"", we see ""red"" repeated. This further suggests that ""bluf"" could mean ""repeat the next color"".

Input: dax bluf wif zup dax
Output: green green red yellow green

Here, ""dax"" correlates with ""green"", and ""green"" is repeated after ""bluf"". Again, ""bluf"" appears to indicate repeating the next color which, in this case, is ""red"" associated with ""wif"".

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is followed by ""yellow"" once more after ""bluf"". ""Wif"" is associated with ""red"", but it is not repeated after ""bluf"". However, ""walm"" is a new word in this example and is followed by two more ""red"" in the output.

Considering the above examples and analyzing the patterns, ""bluf"" seems to indicate repeating the next color in the sequence. It is important to note that in the last example, ""bluf"" does not precede any color, yet there is a repetition of ""red"". This could be because a new word (walm) is introduced, and without prior mapping, we cannot be certain of its association.

Bluf -> meaning. Rule:
""bluf"" means ""repeat the next color."" If ""bluf"" precedes a word that we have already learned the color of, it means the color of that word gets repeated in the output. If it precedes a new word with an undetermined color, the rule might not apply or the color is inferred by the repetition on the output side.
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word multiple times. The number of repetitions is determined by the number of times the preceding color word has already occurred.

- In the first example, ""lug"" (blue) is repeated twice before ""walm"", and thus ""walm"" results in ""blue"" repeated twice more.
- In the second example, ""lug"" occurs once before ""walm"", resulting in ""blue"" repeated three times (since ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" for the first time).
- In the third and fourth examples, ""walm"" directly follows a single color word (""zup"" for yellow and ""dax"" for green), hence ""walm"" translates into the color of the preceding word repeated three times.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) which has not occurred before, leading to ""red"" being repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif
    ",Output: green red,green red,True,195
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the output. Regardless of its position in the input sequence, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, ""dax"" translates to the word ""green."" It appears that each occurrence of ""dax"" corresponds to one ""green"" in the output.

Rule: Every instance of the word ""dax"" in the input is replaced by the word ""green"" in the output.
Based on the examples, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" So:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each instance of ""zup"" in the input is translated to ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to transform into the word ""blue"" in the output. However, its transformation does not appear to be entirely independent, as other words in the input also correspond to certain colors in the output. Here's the pattern I can induce from the given examples:

- ""lug bluf"" outputs ""blue blue,"" which indicates ""lug"" results in ""blue"" and so does ""bluf.""
- ""zup bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow,"" which suggests ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" and so does ""bluf.""
- ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" outputs ""green yellow red red blue,"" where ""dax"" could correspond to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""bluf"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
- ""wif bluf lug zup"" outputs ""red red blue yellow,"" suggesting a rearrangement of the previous words and corresponding colors.
- ""wif bluf lug"" outputs ""red red blue,"" following the same pattern with the provided examples and corresponding colors.

Now, taking another look, it's apparent that ""bluf"" always translates to ""red"" except when it's preceded or followed by the word that translates to ""blue"" (which, from these examples, is ""lug""). If ""bluf"" is either preceded or followed by ""lug,"" it translates to ""blue""; otherwise, it's ""red"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be: ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" if adjacent to ""lug"", presumably the color associated with ""lug"", and to ""red"" otherwise.

Rule: bluf -> ""blue"" if adjacent to ""lug"" (word associated with blue), ""red"" otherwise.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" consistently translates to the color green. The first three inputs are identical and yield the same output of ""green green green."" The fourth input contains ""walm"" and produces ""green"" once again amongst the other colors in the output. 

The last input contains ""walm"" amidst several other nonce words and its corresponding output is ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" From this, we can infer that each nonce word corresponds to a color and the position of ""walm"" in the string correlates to the position of ""green"" in the output.

Rule:
walm -> green

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup dax zup walm
    ",Output: green yellow green yellow green,green yellow green yellow yellow yellow,False,196
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds directly to the color ""blue."" Every instance of ""lug"" in the input is translated to ""blue"" in the output. The context of ""lug"" in the sentence does not appear to influence its meaning; regardless of position or surrounding words, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in every given example.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" We can discern this pattern by observing that every instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output.

Here is how the correlation works with each provided example:

- In the first example, ""wif dax lug walm,"" the output is ""red green blue blue blue."" The word ""wif"" is directly followed by ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" by itself produces the output ""red,"" further reinforcing the association.
- In the third example, ""lug zup wif,"" the output is ""blue yellow red,"" and again ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup wif,"" the output follows the same pattern with ""yellow red.""
- Lastly, in the example ""zup wif walm lug,"" the output is ""yellow red red red blue,"" where ""wif"" is once again matched with ""red.""

Summarizing the rule:

wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
Bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" appears to be determined by the word that precedes it in the sequence. It translates to a color, which is doubled.

Here are the derived pattern mappings based on the given input and output sequences:

- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"", the resultant output is ""blue blue"".
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", the resultant output is ""red red"".
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", the resultant output is ""green green"".
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" on its own but isn't shown to precede ""bluf""; its influence on ""bluf"" is therefore unknown.

The general rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color word corresponding to the preceding word and doubles it in the output.

Rule: The word ""bluf"" represents a repetition of the color associated with the word before it.
Based on the provided input and output examples, we can deduce a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm.""

Let's examine the examples one by one:

1. lug dax zup dax walm wif
   blue green yellow green green green red

When walm is introduced after ""dax,"" the output color ""green"" is repeated twice before moving on to the next color ""red"" associated with ""wif.""

2. dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   green red yellow yellow red red red

Here we see walm at the end of the sequence. Following ""wif,"" the color ""red"" is repeated three times, which implies that walm might be causing a repeat of the color associated with the word preceding it.

3. dax lug walm
   green blue blue blue

After lug, which outputs ""blue,"" the appearance of walm leads to ""blue"" being repeated two more times.

4. lug walm zup walm
   blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow

The pattern repeats with walm coming after ""lug"" and ""zup,"" causing the associated colors to repeat twice more.

5. dax lug wif walm
   green blue red red red

The last example reinforces the pattern. After ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" walm causes ""red"" to repeat twice more.

Rule: walm causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated two more times in the output sequence.

walm -> Causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax bluf wif lug
    ",Output: blue green green red blue,blue green green red blue,True,197
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Based on the given examples, whenever the word ""lug"" is input, the consistent output is ""blue."" Therefore, it can be deduced that ""lug"" means ""blue.""
From the examples provided, we're attempting to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""dax"". Let's look at each of the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: dax zup wif zup // Output: green yellow red yellow
   - Here, we see the word ""dax"" translates to ""green"".

2. Input: dax wif // Output: green red
   - Again, ""dax"" translates to ""green"".

3. Input: zup lug dax // Output: yellow blue green
   - ""dax"" is at the end of the sequence and corresponds to ""green"" again.

4. Input: zup dax lug walm zup // Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   - In this input, ""dax"" follows ""zup"" and translates to ""green"".

5. Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax // Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green
   - ""dax"" is at the end and corresponds to ""green"" once more.

From these examples, we can deduce that independently of position or neighboring words, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"". Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of context.

Rule: dax -> green.
Rule: wif -> red

Every time the word ""wif"" appears, the output includes ""red."" Following this pattern:

- wif zup -> red yellow
- wif bluf dax -> red red green
- zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red (wif contributes one red)
- wif walm lug bluf -> red red red blue blue (wif contributes the first red)
- lug zup wif -> blue yellow red (wif contributes the last red)

Therefore, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
Based on the given examples, we can observe that each instance of the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words surrounding it.

So, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" appears to be very straightforward:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare the input with its output across the examples:

1. dax zup lug zup bluf -> green yellow blue yellow yellow
2. lug bluf wif          -> blue blue red
3. zup wif dax wif bluf  -> yellow red green red red
4. lug dax bluf          -> blue green green
5. zup dax bluf          -> yellow green green

From the outputs, when the word ""bluf"" appears, the corresponding output always ends with ""green"" regardless of the context or the words that precede it. There are no instances where ""bluf"" corresponds to another color.

Thus, we can conclude that: bluf -> green

Rule: ""bluf"" means ""green"".
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repeating pattern of a color word that precedes it. Specifically, ""walm"" causes the color word directly before it to be repeated three times in the Output.

Here's the breakdown from the examples:

1. wif walm -> red red red (The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and is repeated three times due to ""walm"".)
2. lug wif zup wif walm -> blue red yellow red red red (Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and is repeated three times due to ""walm"".)
3. lug walm wif lug -> blue blue blue red blue (The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and is repeated three times due to ""walm"".)
4. wif dax lug walm -> red green blue blue blue (The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and is repeated three times due to ""walm"".)
5. wif zup lug dax zup walm -> red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow (The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is repeated three times due to ""walm"".)

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word that precedes ""walm"" three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,198
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
dax -> meaning. Meaning: green. Rule: Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
Based on the examples provided, the word 'wif' appears to correspond to the English word 'red'. However, it's worth noting that the other words in the examples ('lug', 'zup', 'walm', 'bluf', 'dax') each translate consistently to a color as well ('lug' to 'blue', 'zup' to 'yellow', 'walm' to an additional 'red', 'bluf' to 'yellow', 'dax' to 'green').

Here are the example inputs and outputs, broken down:

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red
We see that 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', 'wif' to 'red', and 'walm' to 'red'.

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow
Here, 'wif' corresponds to 'red' and 'zup' to 'yellow'.

Input: wif lug zup bluf
Output: red blue yellow yellow
Again, 'wif' corresponds to 'red', 'lug' to 'blue', 'zup' to 'yellow', and interestingly, 'bluf', despite its similarity to 'blue', corresponds to 'yellow' based on the pattern.

Input: zup lug walm wif dax
Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
Here we see 'zup' is 'yellow', 'lug' is 'blue', 'walm' is 'blue' but it should probably also be 'red' based on the first example (suggesting a possible typo or error), 'wif' is 'red', and 'dax' is 'green'.

Input: dax lug wif
Output: green blue red
'Dax' corresponds to 'green', 'lug' to 'blue', and 'wif' to 'red'.

Rule:
wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in every provided example.
From the given examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color output following a pattern. To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can look at the different contexts in which it appears and its corresponding color output.

- In the first example, ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green,"" and the appearance of ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif bluf"" yields ""red red,"" and again ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- In the third example, ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" becomes ""red yellow yellow red green."" In this sequence, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and precedes ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" Thus ""bluf"" here corresponds to the second ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue,"" where ""bluf"" appears after ""zup"" and before ""lug,"" corresponding to the second ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug bluf dax bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue green green."" Here ""bluf"" appears twice: first after ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" and then before ""dax,"" which translates to ""green."" 

From the consistency of the examples, especially where ""bluf"" is directly adjacent to another word, a pattern emerges. ""Bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word that appears immediately before it in the sequence.

Rule:
bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" takes on the color designated by the word immediately preceding it.
Based on the examples provided:

- Each instance of ""lug"" is consistently translated to ""blue"".
- Each instance of ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red"".
- ""zup"" seems to translate to ""yellow"" when it is present.

The word ""walm"" is somewhat dependent on the context:

In the first and fourth examples, ""lug walm"" directly translates to ""blue blue blue"". This suggests that ""walm"" could stand for a repetition of ""blue"" twice, following the initial ""blue"" from ""lug"".

However, the other examples complicate this:

- In the second example, ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" translates to a sequence where ""lug walm"" results in three ""blue"", ""zup"" results in ""yellow"", and ""wif"" results in ""red"". The sequence ""lug zup wif"" seems to be one blue, one yellow, followed by a red without repetition. Therefore, ""walm"" seems to again cause a repetition.
- The third example shows ""lug bluf wif"" translating to ""blue blue red"", which is consistent with the previous translations except for the occurrence of ""bluf"" which has not been explained but appears to translate to ""blue"". Then ""lug wif walm lug"" results in ""blue red red red blue"", showing that ""walm"" once again is involved in something that results in repeated colors.
- The fifth example, ""zup lug walm wif walm"", should then, following the pattern, convert ""walm"" into repeated colors based on the preceding color word: ""walm"" after ""lug"" leads to repeated ""blue"" (as shown in previous examples), and ""walm"" after ""wif"" leads to repeated ""red"".

Considering the above analysis, ""walm"" seems to be a rule that calls for the repetition of the color word immediately preceding it. Therefore:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color word that immediately precedes ""walm"" two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
